# 10.6 Thevenin and Norton Equivalent Circuits

Thevenin's and Norton's theorems are applied to ac circuits in the same way as they are to dc circuits. The only additional effort arises from the need to manipulate complex numbers. The frequency domain version of a Thevenin equivalent circuit is depicted in Fig. 10.20, where a linear circuit is replaced by a voltage source in series with an impedance. The Norton equivalent circuit is illustrated in Fig. 10.21, where a linear circuit is replaced by a current source in parallel with an impedance. Keep in mind that the two equivalent circuits are related as

$$
\mathbf{V}_{\mathrm{Th}} = \mathbf{Z}_{N}\mathbf{I}_{N},\qquad \mathbf{Z}_{\mathrm{Th}} = \mathbf{Z}_{N} \tag{10.2}
$$

Figure 10.21 Norton equivalent.

just as in source transformation.  $\mathbf{V}_{\mathrm{Th}}$  is the open- circuit voltage while  $\mathbf{I}_{N}$  is the short- circuit current.

If the circuit has sources operating at different frequencies (see Example 10.6, for example), the Thevenin or Norton equivalent circuit must be determined at each frequency. This leads to entirely different equivalent circuits, one for each frequency, not one equivalent circuit with equivalent sources and equivalent impedances.

# Example 10.8

Obtain the Thevenin equivalent at terminals  $a - b$  of the circuit in Fig. 10.22.

Figure 10.22 For Example 10.8.

# Solution:

We find  $\mathbf{Z}_{\mathrm{Th}}$  by setting the voltage source to zero. As shown in Fig. 10.23(a), the  $8 - \Omega$  resistance is now in parallel with the  $- j6$  reactance, so that their combination gives

$$
\mathbf{Z}_{1} = -j6\parallel 8 = \frac{-j6\times 8}{8 - j6} = 2.88 - j3.84\Omega
$$

Similarly, the  $4 - \Omega$  resistance is in parallel with the  $j12$  reactance, and their combination gives

$$
\mathbf{Z}_{2} = 4\parallel j12 = \frac{j12\times 4}{4 + j12} = 3.6 + j1.2\Omega
$$

The Thevenin impedance is the series combination of  $\mathbf{Z}_{1}$  and  $\mathbf{Z}_{2}$ ; that is,

$$
\mathbf{Z}_{\mathrm{Th}} = \mathbf{Z}_{1} + \mathbf{Z}_{2} = 6.48 - j2.64\Omega
$$

To find  $\mathbf{V}_{\mathrm{Th}}$ , consider the circuit in Fig. 10.23(b). Currents  $\mathbf{I}_{1}$  and  $\mathbf{I}_{2}$  are obtained as

$$
\mathbf{I}_{1} = \frac{120 / 75^{\circ}}{8 - j6}\mathbf{A},\qquad \mathbf{I}_{2} = \frac{120 / 75^{\circ}}{4 + j12}\mathbf{A}
$$

Applying KVL around loop bcdeab in Fig. 10.23(b) gives

$$
\mathbf{V}_{\mathrm{Th}} - 4\mathbf{I}_{2} + (-j6)\mathbf{I}_{1} = 0
$$

or

$$
\begin{array}{l}{{\bf V}_{\mathrm{Th}}=4{\bf I}_{2}+j6{\bf I}_{1}=\frac{480/75^{\circ}}{4+j12}+\frac{720/75^{\circ}+90^{\circ}}{8-j6}}\\ {=37.95/3.43^{\circ}+72/201.87^{\circ}}\\ {=-28.936-j24.55=37.95/220.31^{\circ}\mathrm{~V~}}\end{array}

Figure 10.25

For Example 10.9.

# Solution:

To find  $\mathbf{V}_{\mathrm{Th}}$ , we apply KCL at node 1 in Fig. 10.26(a).

$$
15 = \mathbf{I}_{o} + 0.5 \mathbf{I}_{o} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \mathbf{I}_{o} = 10 \mathrm{~A}
$$

Applying KVL to the loop on the right- hand side in Fig. 10.26(a), we obtain

$$
-\mathbf{I}_{o}(2 - j4) + 0.5 \mathbf{I}_{o}(4 + j3) + \mathbf{V}_{\mathrm{Th}} = 0
$$

or

$$
\mathbf{V}_{\mathrm{Th}} = 10(2 - j4) - 5(4 + j3) = -j55
$$

Thus, the Thevenin voltage is

$$
\mathbf{V}_{\mathrm{Th}} = 55 / - 90^{\circ} \mathrm{~V}
$$

Figure 10.26 Solution of the problem in Fig. 10.25: (a) finding  $\mathbf{V}_{\mathrm{Th}}$ , (b) finding  $\mathbf{Z}_{\mathrm{Th}}$ .

To obtain  $\mathbf{Z}_{\mathrm{Th}}$ , we remove the independent source. Due to the presence of the dependent current source, we connect a 3- A current source (3 is an arbitrary value chosen for convenience here, a number divisible by the sum of currents leaving the node) to terminals  $a - b$  as shown in Fig. 10.26(b). At the node, KCL gives

$$
3 = \mathbf{I}_{o} + 0.5\mathbf{I}_{o}\qquad \Rightarrow \qquad \mathbf{I}_{o} = 2\mathbf{A}
$$

Applying KVL to the outer loop in Fig. 10.26(b) gives

$$
\mathbf{V}_{s} = \mathbf{I}_{o}(4 + j3 + 2 - j4) = 2(6 - j)
$$

The Thevenin impedance is

$$
\mathbf{Z}_{\mathrm{Th}} = \frac{\mathbf{V}_{s}}{\mathbf{I}_{s}} = \frac{2(6 - j)}{3} = 4 - j0.6667\Omega
$$

Determine the Thevenin equivalent of the circuit in Fig. 10.27 as seen from the terminals  $a - b$ .

Answer:  $\mathbf{Z}_{\mathrm{Th}} = 4.473 / - 7.64^{\circ}\Omega$ ,  $\mathbf{V}_{\mathrm{Th}} = 7.35 / 72.9^{\circ}$  volts.

Figure 10.28 For Example 10.10.

Example 10.10

# Solution:

Our first objective is to find the Norton equivalent at terminals  $a - b$ .  $\mathbf{Z}_{N}$  is found in the same way as  $\mathbf{Z}_{\mathrm{Th}}$ . We set the sources to zero as shown in Fig. 10.29(a). As evident from the figure, the  $(8 - j2)$  and  $(10 + j4)$  impedances are short- circuited, so that

$$
\mathbf{Z}_{N} = 5\Omega
$$

To get  $\mathbf{I}_{N}$ , we short- circuit terminals  $a - b$  as in Fig. 10.29(b) and apply mesh analysis. Notice that meshes 2 and 3 form a supermesh because of the current source linking them. For mesh 1,

$$
-j40 + (18 + j2)\mathbf{I}_{1} - (8 - j2)\mathbf{I}_{2} - (10 + j4)\mathbf{I}_{3} = 0 \tag{10.10.1}
$$

Figure 10.29 Solution of the circuit in Fig. 10.28: (a) finding  $\mathbf{Z}_{N}$ , (b) finding  $\mathbf{V}_{N}$ , (c) calculating  $\mathbf{I}_{o}$ .

For the supermesh,

$$
(13 - j2)\mathbf{I}_{2} + (10 + j4)\mathbf{I}_{3} - (18 + j2)\mathbf{I}_{1} = 0 \tag{10.10.2}
$$

At node  $a$ , due to the current source between meshes 2 and 3,

$$
\mathbf{I}_{3} = \mathbf{I}_{2} + 3 \tag{10.10.3}
$$

Adding Eqs. (10.10.1) and (10.10.2) gives

$$
+j40 + 5\mathbf{I}_{2} = 0 \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad \mathbf{I}_{2} = j8
$$

From Eq. (10.10.3),

$$
\mathbf{I}_{3} = \mathbf{I}_{2} + 3 = 3 + j8
$$

The Norton current is

$$
\mathbf{I}_{N} = \mathbf{I}_{3} = (3 + j8) \mathbf{A}
$$

Figure 10.29(c) shows the Norton equivalent circuit along with the impedance at terminals  $a - b$ . By current division,

$$
\mathbf{I}_{o} = \frac{5}{5 + 20 + j15} \mathbf{I}_{N} = \frac{3 + j8}{5 + j3} = 1.465 / 38.48^{\circ} \mathbf{A}

# 10.7 Op Amp AC Circuits

The three steps stated in Section 10.1 also apply to op amp circuits, as long as the op amp is operating in the linear region. As usual, we will assume ideal op amps. (See Section 5.2. ) As discussed in Chapter 5, the key to analyzing op amp circuits is to keep two important properties of an ideal op amp in mind:

1. No current enters either of its input terminals.

2. The voltage across its input terminals is zero.

The following examples will illustrate these ideas.

Determine  $\nu_{o}(t)$  for the op amp circuit in Fig. 10.31(a) if  $\nu_{s} =$  3 cos 1000t V.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-14/63c420e9-9220-47ad-935a-09e6b2aeb2a8/e8ca78cc99dc3fc74def3c3dbdf422880067e16f3ba20fd0f35eb9e9caa81bf4.jpg)  
Figure 10.31 For Example 10.11: (a) the original circuit in the time domain, (b) its frequency domain equivalent.

# Solution:

We first transform the circuit to the frequency domain, as shown in Fig. 10.31(b), where  $\mathbf{V}_{s} = 3\underline{{0^{\circ}}}$ $\omega = 1000$  rad/s. Applying KCL at node 1, we obtain

$$
\frac{3\underline{{0^{\circ}}} - \mathbf{V}_{1}}{10} = \frac{\mathbf{V}_{1}}{-j5} +\frac{\mathbf{V}_{1} - 0}{10} +\frac{\mathbf{V}_{1} - \mathbf{V}_{o}}{20}
$$

or

$$
6 = (5 + j4)\mathbf{V}_{1} - \mathbf{V}_{o} \tag{10.11.1}
$$

At node 2, KCL gives

$$
\begin{array}{r l}{\mathbf{V}_{1} - 0} & {{}0 - \mathbf{V}_{o}}\\ {10} & {{} - j10} \end{array}
$$

which leads to

$$
\mathbf{V}_{1} = -j\mathbf{V}_{o} \tag{10.11.2}
$$

Substituting Eq. (10.11.2) into Eq. (10.11.1) yields

$$
6 = -j(5 + j4)\mathbf{V}_{o} - \mathbf{V}_{o} = (3 - j5)\mathbf{V}_{o}
$$

$$
\mathbf{V}_{o} = \frac{6}{3 - j5} = 1.029\underline{{/59.04^{\circ}}}
$$

Hence,

$$
\nu_{o}(t) = 1.029\cos (1000t + 59.04^{\circ})\mathrm{~V~}
$$

$$

Since the circuit in Fig. 10.33 is an inverting amplifier, the closed- loop gain is given by

$$
\mathbf{G} = \frac{\mathbf{V}_{o}}{\mathbf{V}_{s}} = -\frac{\mathbf{Z}_{f}}{\mathbf{Z}_{i}} = \frac{-j\omega C_{1}R_{2}}{(1 + j\omega R_{1}C_{1})(1 + j\omega R_{2}C_{2})}
$$

Substituting the given values of  $R_{1}, R_{2}, C_{1}, C_{2}$ , and  $\omega$ , we obtain

$$
\mathbf{G} = \frac{-j4}{(1 + j4)(1 + j2)} = 0.434 / 130.6^{\circ}
$$

Thus, the closed- loop gain is 0.434 and the phase shift is  $130.6^{\circ}$ .

# 10.8 AC Analysis Using PSpice

10.8 AC Analysis Using PSpicePSpice affords a big relief from the tedious task of manipulating complex numbers in ac circuit analysis. The procedure for using PSpice for ac analysis is quite similar to that required for dc analysis. The reader should read Section D.5 in Appendix D for a review of PSpice concepts for ac analysis. AC circuit analysis is done in the phasor or frequency domain, and all sources must have the same frequency. Although ac analysis with PSpice involves using AC Sweep, our analysis in this chapter requires a single frequency  $f = \omega /2\pi$ . The output file of PSpice contains voltage and current phasors. If necessary, the impedances can be calculated using the voltages and currents in the output file.

Obtain  $\nu_{o}$  and  $i_{o}$  in the circuit of Fig. 10.35 using PSpice.

Figure 10.35 For Example 10.13.

# Solution:

We first convert the sine function to cosine.

$$
\begin{array}{c}8\sin (1000t + 50^{\circ}) = 8\cos (1000t + 50^{\circ} - 90^{\circ}) \\ = 8\cos (1000t - 40^{\circ}) \end{array}
$$

The frequency  $f$  is obtained from  $\omega$  as

$$
f = \frac{\omega}{2\pi} = \frac{1000}{2\pi} = 159.155 \mathrm{Hz}
$$

The schematic for the circuit is shown in Fig. 10.36. Notice that the current- controlled current source F1 is connected such that its current flows from node 0 to node 3 in conformity with the original circuit in Fig. 10.35. Since we only want the magnitude and phase of  $\nu_{o}$  and  $i_{o}$ , we set the attributes of IPRINT and VPRINT1 each to  $AC = yes$ ,  $MAG = yes$ ,  $PHASE = yes$ . As a single- frequency analysis, we select Analysis/Setup/AC Sweep and enter Total  $Pts = 1$ , Start  $Freq = 159.155$ , and Final  $Freq = 159.155$ . After saving the schematic, we simulate it by selecting Analysis/Simulate. The output file includes the source frequency in addition to the attributes checked for the pseudocomponents IPRINT and VPRINT1,

# Example 10.14

Find  $\mathbf{V}_{1}$  and  $\mathbf{V}_{2}$  in the circuit of Fig. 10.38.

# Solution:

1. Define. In its present form, the problem is clearly stated. Again, we must emphasize that time spent here will save lots of time and expense later on! One thing that might have created a problem for you is that, if the reference was missing for this problem, you would then need to ask the individual assigning the problem where

Figure 10.38 For Example 10.14.

it is to be located. If you could not do that, then you would need to assume where it should be and then clearly state what you did and why you did it.

2. Present. The given circuit is a frequency domain circuit and the unknown node voltages  $\mathbf{V}_{1}$  and  $\mathbf{V}_{2}$  are also frequency domain values. Clearly, we need a process to solve for these unknowns in the frequency domain.

3. Alternative. We have two direct alternative solution techniques that we can easily use. We can do a straightforward nodal analysis approach or use PSpice. Since this example is in a section dedicated to using PSpice to solve problems, we will use PSpice to find  $\mathbf{V}_{1}$  and  $\mathbf{V}_{2}$ . We can then use nodal analysis to check the answer.

4. Attempt. The circuit in Fig. 10.35 is in the time domain, whereas the one in Fig. 10.38 is in the frequency domain. Since we are not given a particular frequency and PSpice requires one, we select any frequency consistent with the given impedances. For example, if we select  $\omega = 1$  rad/s, the corresponding frequency is  $f = \omega /2\pi = 0.15916 \mathrm{~Hz}$ . We obtain the values of the capacitance ( $C = 1 / \omega X_{C}$ ) and inductances ( $L = X_{L} / \omega$ ). Making these changes results in the schematic in Fig. 10.39. To ease wiring, we have exchanged the positions of the voltage-controlled current source

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-14/63c420e9-9220-47ad-935a-09e6b2aeb2a8/ac9932af54df3c943fce31705b47d00b34378fb2dff8a65543cae88860ff4d48.jpg)

G1 and the  $2 + j2\Omega$  impedance. Notice that the current of G1 flows from node 1 to node 3, while the controlling voltage is across the capacitor C2, as required in Fig. 10.38. The attributes of pseudocomponents VPRINT1 are set as shown. As a single- frequency analysis, we select Analysis/Setup/AC Sweep and enter Total  $Pts = 1$ , Start  $Freq = 0.15916$ , and Final  $Freq = 0.15916$ . After saving the schematic, we select Analysis/Simulate to simulate the circuit. When this is done, the output file includes

$$
\begin{array}{r l r l r l} & {\mathsf{F R E Q}} & & {\mathsf{V M}(1)} & & {\mathsf{V P}(1)}\\ & {1.592\mathsf{E} - 01} & & {2.708\mathsf{E} + 00} & & {-5.673\mathsf{E} + 01}\\ & {\mathsf{F R E Q}} & & {\mathsf{V M}(3)} & & {\mathsf{V P}(3)}\\ & {1.592\mathsf{E} - 01} & & {4.468\mathsf{E} + 00} & & {-1.026\mathsf{E} + 02} \end{array}
$$

from which we obtain,

$$
\mathbf{V}_{1} = 2.708\big / - 56.74^{\circ}\mathbf{V}\qquad \mathrm{and}\qquad \mathbf{V}_{2} = 6.911\big / - 80.72^{\circ}\mathbf{V}
$$

5. Evaluate. One of the most important lessons to be learned is that when using programs such as PSpice you still need to validate the answer. There are many opportunities for making a mistake, including coming across an unknown "bug" in PSpice that yields incorrect results.

So, how can we validate this solution? Obviously, we can rework the entire problem with nodal analysis, and perhaps using MATLAB, to see if we obtain the same results. There is another way we will use here: Write the nodal equations and substitute the answers obtained in the PSpice solution, and see if the nodal equations are satisfied.

The nodal equations for this circuit are given below. Note we have substituted  $\mathbf{V}_{1} = \mathbf{V}_{x}$  into the dependent source.

$$
-3 + \frac{\mathbf{V}_{1} - 0}{1} +\frac{\mathbf{V}_{1} - 0}{-j1} +\frac{\mathbf{V}_{1} - \mathbf{V}_{2}}{2 + j2} +0.2\mathbf{V}_{1} + \frac{\mathbf{V}_{1} - \mathbf{V}_{2}}{-j2} = 0
$$

$$
(1 + j + 0.25 - j0.25 + 0.2 + j0.5)\mathbf{V}_{1}
$$

$$
-(0.25 - j0.25 + j0.5)\mathbf{V}_{2} = 3
$$

$$
(1.45 + j1.25)\mathbf{V}_{1} - (0.25 + j0.25)\mathbf{V}_{2} = 3
$$

$$
1.9144\big / 40.76^{\circ}\mathbf{V}_{1} - 0.3536\big / 45^{\circ}\mathbf{V}_{2} = 3
$$

Now, to check the answer, we substitute the PSpice answers into this.

$$
\begin{array}{r l} & {1.9144\big / 40.76^{\circ}\times 2.708\big / - 56.74^{\circ} - 0.3536\big / 45^{\circ}\times 6.911\big / - 80.72^{\circ}}\\ & {\qquad = 5.184\big / - 15.98^{\circ} - 2.444\big / - 35.72^{\circ}}\\ & {\qquad = 4.984 - j1.4272 - 1.9842 + j1.4269}\\ & {\qquad = 3 - j0.0003\qquad [\mathrm{Answer~checks}]} \end{array}
$$

6. Satisfactory? Although we used only the equation from node 1 to check the answer, this is more than satisfactory to validate the answer from the PSpice solution. We can now present our work as a solution to the problem.

# 10.9 Applications

The concepts learned in this chapter will be applied in later chapters to calculate electric power and determine frequency response. The concepts are also used in analyzing coupled circuits, three- phase circuits, ac transistor circuits, filters, oscillators, and other ac circuits. In this section, we apply the concepts to develop two practical ac circuits: the capacitance multiplier and the sine wave oscillators.

# 10.9.1 Capacitance Multiplier

The op amp circuit in Fig. 10.41 is known as a capacitance multiplier, for reasons that will become obvious. Such a circuit is used in integrated- circuit technology to produce a multiple of a small physical capacitance  $C$  when a large capacitance is needed. The circuit in Fig. 10.41 can be used to multiply capacitance values by a factor up to 1,000. For example, a 10- pF capacitor can be made to behave like a 100- nF capacitor.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-14/63c420e9-9220-47ad-935a-09e6b2aeb2a8/1d6e14ecf67c2dd220ae8a6b9a94f6f218c27ef00ac8aa9f2f14b2f46e9ec357.jpg)  
Figure 10.41 Capacitance multiplier.

In Fig. 10.41, the first op amp operates as a voltage follower, while the second one is an inverting amplifier. The voltage follower isolates the capacitance formed by the circuit from the loading imposed by the inverting amplifier. Since no current enters the input terminals of the op amp, the input current  $\mathbf{I}_i$  flows through the feedback capacitor. Hence, at node 1,

$$
\mathbf{I}_i = \frac{\mathbf{V}_i - \mathbf{V}_o}{1 / j\omega C} = j\omega C(\mathbf{V}_i - \mathbf{V}_o) \tag{10.3}
$$

Applying KCL at node 2 gives

$$
\frac{\mathbf{V}_i - 0}{R_1} = \frac{0 - \mathbf{V}_o}{R_2}
$$

or

$$
\mathbf{V}_o = -\frac{R_2}{R_1}\mathbf{V}_i \tag{10.4}
$$

Substituting Eq. (10.4) into (10.3) gives

$$
\mathbf{I}_i = j\omega C\left(1 + \frac{R_2}{R_1}\right)\mathbf{V}_i
$$

or

$$
\frac{\mathbf{I}_i}{\mathbf{V}_i} = j\omega \left(1 + \frac{R_2}{R_1}\right)C \tag{10.5}
$$

The input impedance is

$$
\mathbf{Z}_i = \frac{\mathbf{V}_i}{\mathbf{I}_i} = \frac{1}{j\omega C_{\mathrm{eq}}} \tag{10.6}
$$

where

$$
C_{\mathrm{eq}} = \left(1 + \frac{R_2}{R_1}\right)C \tag{10.7}
$$

Thus, by a proper selection of the values of  $R_{1}$  and  $R_{2}$  , the op amp circuit in Fig. 10.41 can be made to produce an effective capacitance between the input terminal and ground, which is a multiple of the physical capacitance  $C$  The size of the effective capacitance is practically limited by the inverted output voltage limitation. Thus, the larger the capacitance multiplication, the smaller is the allowable input voltage to prevent the op amps from reaching saturation.

A similar op amp circuit can be designed to simulate inductance. (See Prob. 10.89. ) There is also an op amp circuit configuration to create a resistance multiplier.

# Example 10.15

Calculate  $C_{\mathrm{eq}}$  in Fig. 10.41 when  $R_{1} = 10\mathrm{k}\Omega$ ,  $R_{2} = 1\mathrm{M}\Omega$ , and  $C = 1\mathrm{nF}$ .

# Solution:

From Eq. (10.7)

$$
C_{\mathrm{eq}} = \left(1 + \frac{R_2}{R_1}\right)C = \left(1 + \frac{1\times 10^6}{10\times 10^3}\right)1\mathrm{nF} = 101\mathrm{nF}
$$

Determine the equivalent capacitance of the op amp circuit in Fig. 10.41 if  $R_{1} = 10 \mathrm{k}\Omega$ ,  $R_{2} = 10 \mathrm{M}\Omega$ , and  $C = 10 \mathrm{nF}$ .

Answer:  $10 \mu \mathrm{F}$ .

# 10.9.2 Oscillators

We know that dc is produced by batteries. But how do we produce ac? One way is using oscillators, which are circuits that convert dc to ac.

An oscillator is a circuit that produces an ac waveform as output when powered by a dc input.

The only external source an oscillator needs is the dc power supply. Ironically, the dc power supply is usually obtained by converting the ac supplied by the electric utility company to dc. Having gone through the trouble of conversion, one may wonder why we need to use the oscillator to convert the dc to ac again. The problem is that the ac supplied by the utility company operates at a preset frequency of  $60 \mathrm{~Hz}$  in the United States (50  $\mathrm{~Hz}$  in some other nations), whereas many applications such as electronic circuits, communication systems, and microwave devices require internally generated frequencies that range from 0 to  $10 \mathrm{GHz}$  or higher. Oscillators are used for generating these frequencies.

In order for sine wave oscillators to sustain oscillations, they must meet the Barkhausen criteria:

1. The overall gain of the oscillator must be unity or greater. Therefore, losses must be compensated for by an amplifying device. 
2. The overall phase shift (from input to output and back to the input) must be zero.

Three common types of sine wave oscillators are phase- shift, twin  $T$ , and Wien- bridge oscillators. Here we consider only the Wien- bridge oscillator.

The Wien- bridge oscillator is widely used for generating sinusoids in the frequency range below  $1 \mathrm{MHz}$ . It is an  $RC$  op amp circuit with only a few components, easily tunable and easy to design. As shown in Fig. 10.42, the oscillator essentially consists of a noninverting amplifier with two feedback paths: The positive feedback path to the noninverting input creates oscillations, while the negative feedback path to the inverting input controls the gain. If we define the impedances of the  $RC$  series and parallel combinations as  $\mathbf{Z}_{s}$  and  $\mathbf{Z}_{p}$ , then

$$
\begin{array}{l}\mathbf{Z}_s = R_1 + \frac{1}{j\omega C_1} = R_1 - \frac{j}{\omega C_1}\\ \displaystyle \mathbf{Z}_p = R_2\| \frac{1}{j\omega C_2} = \frac{R_2}{1 + j\omega R_2C_2} \end{array} \tag{10.9}
$$

The feedback ratio is

$$
\frac{\mathbf{V}_2}{\mathbf{V}_o} = \frac{\mathbf{Z}_p}{\mathbf{Z}_s + \mathbf{Z}_p} \tag{10.10}
$$

This corresponds to  $\omega = 2\pi f = 377 \mathrm{rad} / \mathrm{s}$ .

Figure 10.42 Wien-bridge oscillator.

Substituting Eqs. (10.8) and (10.9) into Eq. (10.10) gives

$$
\begin{array}{r l} & {\frac{\mathbf{V}_{2}}{\mathbf{V}_{o}} = \frac{R_{2}}{R_{2} + \left(R_{1} - \frac{j}{\omega C_{1}}\right)\left(1 + j\omega R_{2}C_{2}\right)}}\\ & {\quad \quad = \frac{\omega R_{2}C_{1}}{\omega(R_{2}C_{1} + R_{1}C_{1} + R_{2}C_{2}) + j(\omega^{2}R_{1}C_{1}R_{2}C_{2} - 1)}} \end{array} \tag{10.11}
$$

To satisfy the second Barkhausen criterion,  $\mathbf{V}_{2}$  must be in phase with  $\mathbf{V}_{o}$ , which implies that the ratio in Eq. (10.11) must be purely real. Hence, the imaginary part must be zero. Setting the imaginary part equal to zero gives the oscillation frequency  $\omega_{o}$  as

$$
\omega_{o}^{2}R_{1}C_{1}R_{2}C_{2} - 1 = 0
$$

or

$$
\omega_{o} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{R_{1}R_{2}C_{1}C_{2}}} \tag{10.12}
$$

In most practical applications,  $R_{1} = R_{2} = R$  and  $C_{1} = C_{2} = C$ , so that

$$
\omega_{o} = \frac{1}{RC} = 2\pi f_{o} \tag{10.13}
$$

or

$$
f_{o} = \frac{1}{2\pi RC} \tag{10.14}
$$

Substituting Eq. (10.13) and  $R_{1} = R_{2} = R$ ,  $C_{1} = C_{2} = C$  into Eq. (10.11) yields

$$
\frac{\mathbf{V}_{2}}{\mathbf{V}_{o}} = \frac{1}{3} \tag{10.15}
$$

Thus, in order to satisfy the first Barkhausen criterion, the op amp must compensate by providing a gain of 3 or greater so that the overall gain is at least 1 or unity. We recall that for a noninverting amplifier,

$$
\frac{\mathbf{V}_{o}}{\mathbf{V}_{2}} = 1 + \frac{R_{f}}{R_{g}} = 3 \tag{10.16}
$$

or

$$
R_{f} = 2R_{g} \tag{10.17}
$$

Due to the inherent delay caused by the op amp, Wien- bridge oscillators are limited to operating in the frequency range of  $1\mathrm{MHz}$  or less.

Example 10.16 Design a Wien- bridge circuit to oscillate at  $100\mathrm{kHz}$ .

# Solution:

Using Eq. (10.14), we obtain the time constant of the circuit as

$$
R C = \frac{1}{2\pi f_{o}} = \frac{1}{2\pi\times100\times10^{3}} = 1.59\times 10^{-6} \tag{10.16.1}
$$

If we select  $R = 10\mathrm{k}\Omega$ , then we can select  $C = 159\mathrm{pF}$  to satisfy Eq. (10.16.1). Since the gain must be 3,  $R_{f} / R_{g} = 2$ . We could select  $R_{f} = 20\mathrm{k}\Omega$  while  $R_{g} = 10\mathrm{k}\Omega$ .

In the Wien- bridge oscillator circuit in Fig. 10.42, let  $R_{1} = R_{2} = 2.5 \mathrm{k}\Omega$ ,  $C_{1} = C_{2} = 1 \mathrm{nF}$ . Determine the frequency  $f_{o}$  of the oscillator.Answer: 63.66 kHz.

Answer:63.66 kHz.

# 10.10 Summary

1. We apply nodal and mesh analysis to ac circuits by applying KCL and KVL to the phasor form of the circuits.

2. In solving for the steady-state response of a circuit that has independent sources with different frequencies, each independent source must be considered separately. The most natural approach to analyzing such circuits is to apply the superposition theorem. A separate phasor circuit for each frequency must be solved independently, and the corresponding response should be obtained in the time domain. The overall response is the sum of the time domain responses of all the individual phasor circuits.

3. The concept of source transformation is also applicable in the frequency domain.

4. The Thevenin equivalent of an ac circuit consists of a voltage source  $\mathbf{V}_{\mathrm{Th}}$  in series with the Thevenin impedance  $\mathbf{Z}_{\mathrm{Th}}$

5. The Norton equivalent of an ac circuit consists of a current source  $\mathbf{I}_{N}$  in parallel with the Norton impedance  $\mathbf{Z}_{N}(\mathbf{\sigma} = \mathbf{Z}_{\mathrm{Th}})$

6. PSpice is a simple and powerful tool for solving ac circuit problems. It relieves us of the tedious task of working with the complex numbers involved in steady-state analysis.

7. The capacitance multiplier and the ac oscillator provide two typical applications for the concepts presented in this chapter. A capacitance multiplier is an op amp circuit used in producing a multiple of a physical capacitance. An oscillator is a device that uses a dc input to generate an ac output.

# AC Power Analysis

Four things come not back: the spoken word; the sped arrow; time past; the neglected opportunity.

# Enhancing Your Career

# Career in Power Systems

The discovery of the principle of an ac generator by Michael Faraday in 1831 was a major breakthrough in engineering; it provided a convenient way of generating the electric power that is needed in every electronic, electrical, or electromechanical device we use now.

Electric power is obtained by converting energy from sources such as fossil fuels (gas, oil, and coal), nuclear fuel (uranium), hydro energy (water falling through a head), geothermal energy (hot water, steam), wind energy, tidal energy, and biomass energy (wastes). These various ways of generating electric power are studied in detail in the field of power engineering, which has become an indispensable subdiscipline of electrical engineering. An electrical engineer should be familiar with the analysis, generation, transmission, distribution, and cost of electric power.

The electric power industry is a very large employer of electrical engineers. The industry includes thousands of electric utility systems ranging from large, interconnected systems serving large regional areas to small power companies serving individual communities or factories. Due to the complexity of the power industry, there are numerous electrical engineering jobs in different areas of the industry: power plant (generation), transmission and distribution, maintenance, research, data acquisition and flow control, and management. Since electric power is used everywhere, electric utility companies are everywhere, offering exciting training and steady employment for men and women in thousands of communities throughout the world.

# Learning Objectives

1. Fully understand instantaneous and average power.  
2. Understand the basics of maximum average power.  
3. Understand effective or rms values and how to calculate them and to understand their importance.  
4. Understand apparent power (complex power), power, and reactive power and power factor.  
5. Understand power factor correction and the importance of its use.

# 11.1 Introduction

Our effort in ac circuit analysis so far has been focused mainly on calculating voltage and current. Our major concern in this chapter is power analysis.

Power analysis is of paramount importance. Power is the most important quantity in electric utilities, electronic, and communication systems, because such systems involve transmission of power from one point to another. Also, every industrial and household electrical device- every fan, motor, lamp, pressing iron, TV, personal computer- - has a power rating that indicates how much power the equipment requires; exceeding the power rating can do permanent damage to an appliance. The most common form of electric power is 50- or  $60\mathrm{- Hz}$  ac power. The choice of ac over dc allowed high- voltage power transmission from the power generating plant to the consumer.

We will begin by defining and deriving instantaneous power and average power. We will then introduce other power concepts. As practical applications of these concepts, we will discuss how power is measured and reconsider how electric utility companies charge their customers.

# 11.2 Instantaneous and Average Power

As mentioned in Chapter 2, the instantaneous power  $p(t)$  absorbed by an element is the product of the instantaneous voltage  $\nu (t)$  across the element and the instantaneous current  $i(t)$  through it. Assuming the passive sign convention,

$$
p(t) = \nu (t)i(t) \tag{11.1}
$$

We can also think of the instantaneous power as the power absorbed by the element at a specific instant of time. Instantaneous quantities are denoted by lowercase letters.

The instantaneous power (in watts) is the power at any instant of time.

It is the rate at which an element absorbs energy.

Consider the general case of instantaneous power absorbed by an arbitrary combination of circuit elements under sinusoidal excitation,

as shown in Fig. 11.1. Let the voltage and current at the terminals of the circuit be

$$
\begin{array}{r}\nu (t) = V_m\cos (\omega t + \theta_\nu)\\ i(t) = I_m\cos (\omega t + \theta_i) \end{array} \tag{11.2b}
$$

where  $V_{m}$  and  $I_{m}$  are the amplitudes (or peak values), and  $\theta_{\nu}$  and  $\theta_{i}$  are the phase angles of the voltage and current, respectively. The instantaneous power absorbed by the circuit is

$$
p(t) = \nu (t)i(t) = V_mI_m\cos (\omega t + \theta_\nu)\cos (\omega t + \theta_i) \tag{11.3}
$$

We apply the trigonometric identity

$$
\cos A\cos B = \frac{1}{2} [\cos (A - B) + \cos (A + B)] \tag{11.4}
$$

and express Eq. (11.3) as

$$
p(t) = \frac{1}{2} V_mI_m\cos (\theta_\nu -\theta_i) + \frac{1}{2} V_mI_m\cos (2\omega t + \theta_\nu +\theta_i) \tag{11.5}
$$

This shows us that the instantaneous power has two parts. The first part is constant or time independent. Its value depends on the phase difference between the voltage and the current. The second part is a sinusoidal function whose frequency is  $2\omega$ , which is twice the angular frequency of the voltage or current.

A sketch of  $p(t)$  in Eq. (11.5) is shown in Fig. 11.2, where  $T = 2\pi /\omega$  is the period of voltage or current. We observe that  $p(t)$  is periodic,  $p(t) = p(t + T_0)$ , and has a period of  $T_0 = T / 2$ , since its frequency is twice that of voltage or current. We also observe that  $p(t)$  is positive for some part of each cycle and negative for the rest of the cycle. When  $p(t)$  is positive, power is absorbed by the circuit. When  $p(t)$  is negative, power is absorbed by the source; that is, power is transferred from the circuit to the source. This is possible because of the storage elements (capacitors and inductors) in the circuit.

Figure 11.2 The instantaneous power  $p(t)$  entering a circuit.

The instantaneous power changes with time and is therefore difficult to measure. The average power is more convenient to measure. In fact, the wattmeter, the instrument for measuring power, responds to average power.

The average power, in watts, is the average of the instantaneous power over one period.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-14/63c420e9-9220-47ad-935a-09e6b2aeb2a8/b4b0853180c0e26ac7a2ac322c989e7de3ed1c6ef54a79a3850960327832a8c3.jpg)  
Figure 11.1 Sinusoidal source and passive linear circuit.

Thus, the average power is given by

$$
P = \frac{1}{T}\int_{0}^{T}p(t)dt \tag{11.6}
$$

Although Eq. (11.6) shows the averaging done over  $T$ , we would get the same result if we performed the integration over the actual period of  $p(t)$  which is  $T_0 = T / 2$ .

Substituting  $p(t)$  in Eq. (11.5) into Eq. (11.6) gives

$$
\begin{array}{l}{{P=\frac{1}{T}\int_{0}^{T}\frac{1}{2}V_{m}I_{m}\cos(\theta_{\nu}-\theta_{i})d t}}\\ {{\quad+\frac{1}{T}\int_{0}^{T}\frac{1}{2}V_{m}I_{m}\cos(2\omega t+\theta_{\nu}+\theta_{i})d t}}\\ {{\quad=\frac{1}{2}V_{m}I_{m}\cos(\theta_{\nu}-\theta_{i})\frac{1}{T}\int_{0}^{T}d t}}\\ {{\quad+\frac{1}{2}V_{m}I_{m}\frac{1}{T}\int_{0}^{T}\cos(2\omega t+\theta_{\nu}+\theta_{i})d t}}\end{array} \tag{11.7}
$$

The first integrand is constant, and the average of a constant is the same constant. The second integrand is a sinusoid. We know that the average of a sinusoid over its period is zero because the area under the sinusoid during a positive half- cycle is canceled by the area under it during the following negative half- cycle. Thus, the second term in Eq. (11.7) vanishes and the average power becomes

$$
P = \frac{1}{2} V_{m}I_{m}\cos (\theta_{\nu} - \theta_{i}) \tag{11.8}
$$

Since  $\cos (\theta_{\nu} - \theta_{i}) = \cos (\theta_{i} - \theta_{\nu})$ , what is important is the difference in the phases of the voltage and current.

Note that  $p(t)$  is time- varying while  $P$  does not depend on time. To find the instantaneous power, we must necessarily have  $\nu (t)$  and  $i(t)$  in the time domain. But we can find the average power when voltage and current are expressed in the time domain, as in Eq. (11.8), or when they are expressed in the frequency domain. The phasor forms of  $\nu (t)$  and  $i(t)$  in Eq. (11.2) are  $\mathbf{V} = V_{m} / \theta_{\nu}$  and  $\mathbf{I} = I_{m} / \theta_{i}$ , respectively.  $P$  is calculated using Eq. (11.8) or using phasors  $\mathbf{V}$  and  $\mathbf{I}$ . To use phasors, we notice that

$$
\begin{array}{l}\frac{1}{2}\mathbf{V}\mathbf{I}^{*} = \frac{1}{2} V_{m}I_{m} / \theta_{\nu} - \theta_{i}\\ \displaystyle = \frac{1}{2} V_{m}I_{m}[\cos (\theta_{\nu} - \theta_{i}) + j\sin (\theta_{\nu} - \theta_{i})] \end{array} \tag{11.9}
$$

We recognize the real part of this expression as the average power  $P$  according to Eq. (11.8). Thus,

$$
P = \frac{1}{2}\mathrm{Re}[\mathbf{V}\mathbf{I}^{*}] = \frac{1}{2} V_{m}I_{m}\cos (\theta_{\nu} - \theta_{i}) \tag{11.10}
$$

Consider two special cases of Eq. (11.10). When  $\theta_{\nu} = \theta_{i}$ , the voltage and current are in phase. This implies a purely resistive circuit or resistive load  $R$ , and

$$
P = \frac{1}{2} V_{m}I_{m} = \frac{1}{2} I_{m}^{2}R = \frac{1}{2} |\mathbf{I}|^{2}R \tag{11.11}
$$

where  $|\mathbf{I}|^{2} = \mathbf{I} \times \mathbf{I}^{*}$ . Equation (11.11) shows that a purely resistive circuit absorbs power at all times. When  $\theta_{\nu} - \theta_{i} = \pm 90^{\circ}$ , we have a purely reactive circuit, and

$$
P = \frac{1}{2} V_{m}I_{m}\cos 90^{\circ} = 0 \tag{11.12}
$$

showing that a purely reactive circuit absorbs no average power. In summary,

A resistive load  $(R)$  absorbs power at all times, while a reactive load  $(L$  or  $C)$  absorbs zero average power.

Given that

Example 11.1

$$
\nu (t) = 120\cos (377t + 45^{\circ})\mathrm{~V~}\quad \mathrm{and}\quad i(t) = 10\cos (377t - 10^{\circ})\mathrm{~A~}
$$

find the instantaneous power and the average power absorbed by the passive linear network of Fig. 11.1.

# Solution:

The instantaneous power is given by

$$
p = \nu i = 1200\cos (377t + 45^{\circ})\cos (377t - 10^{\circ})
$$

Applying the trigonometric identity

$$
\cos A\cos B = \frac{1}{2} [\cos (A + B) + \cos (A - B)]
$$

gives

$$
p = 600[\cos (754t + 35^{\circ}) + \cos 55^{\circ}]
$$

or

$$
p(t) = 344.2 + 600\cos (754t + 35^{\circ})\mathrm{~W~}
$$

The average power is

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{P=\frac{1}{2}V_{m}I_{m}\cos(\theta_{\nu}-\theta_{i})=\frac{1}{2}120(10)\cos[45^{\circ}-(-10^{\circ})]}}\\ {{=600\cos 55^{\circ}=344.2\mathrm{~W~}}}\end{array}
$$

which is the constant part of  $p(t)$  above.

Calculate the instantaneous power and average power absorbed by the passive linear network of Fig. 11.1 if

$$
\nu (t) = 330\cos (10t + 20^{\circ})\mathrm{~V~}\qquad \mathrm{and}\qquad i(t) = 33\sin (10t + 60^{\circ})\mathrm{~A~}
$$

Calculate the average power absorbed by an impedance  $\mathbf{Z} = 30 - j70\Omega$  when a voltage  $\mathbf{V} = 120\underline{/0^{\circ}}$  is applied across it.

# Solution:

$$
\mathbf{I} = \frac{\mathbf{V}}{\mathbf{Z}} = \frac{120\underline{/0^{\circ}}}{30 - j70} = \frac{120\underline{/0^{\circ}}}{76.16\underline{/ - 66.8^{\circ}}} = 1.576\underline{/66.8^{\circ}}\mathrm{~A~}
$$

The average power is

$$
P = \frac{1}{2} V_{m}I_{m}\cos (\theta_{\nu} - \theta_{i}) = \frac{1}{2} (120)(1.576)\cos (0 - 66.8^{\circ}) = 37.24\mathrm{~W}

\mathbf{I}_R = \mathbf{I} = 1.118\big / 56.57^{\circ}\mathrm{~A~}
$$

and the voltage across it is

$$
\mathbf{V}_R = 4\mathbf{I}_R = 4.472\big / 56.57^{\circ}\mathrm{~V~}
$$

The average power absorbed by the resistor is

$$
P = \frac{1}{2} (4.472)(1.118) = 2.5\mathrm{~W~}
$$

which is the same as the average power supplied. Zero average power is absorbed by the capacitor.

Figure 11.5 For Example 11.4.

# Solution:

We apply mesh analysis as shown in Fig. 11.5(b). For mesh 1,

$$
\mathbf{I}_1 = 4\mathbf{A}
$$

For mesh 2,

$$
(j10 - j5)\mathbf{I}_2 - j10\mathbf{I}_1 + 60\big / 30^\circ = 0,\qquad \mathbf{I}_1 = 4\mathbf{A}
$$

or

$$
\begin{array}{r l}{j5\mathbf{I}_{2} = -60\big / 30^{\circ} + j40\qquad \Rightarrow \qquad \mathbf{I}_{2} = -12\big / - 60^{\circ} + 8}\\ {= 10.58\big / 79.1^{\circ}\mathrm{~A~}} \end{array}
$$

For the voltage source, the current flowing from it is  $\mathbf{I}_2 = 10.58 / 79.1^\circ$  A and the voltage across it is  $60 / 30^\circ$  V, so that the average power is

$$
P_{5} = \frac{1}{2} (60)(10.58)\cos (30^{\circ} - 79.1^{\circ}) = 207.8\mathrm{~W~}
$$

Following the passive sign convention (see Fig. 1.8), this average power is absorbed by the source, in view of the direction of  $\mathbf{I}_2$  and the polarity of the voltage source. That is, the circuit is delivering average power to the voltage source.

For the current source, the current through it is  $\mathbf{I}_1 = 4 / 0^\circ$  and the voltage across it is

$$
\begin{array}{c}{\mathbf{V}_1 = 20\mathbf{I}_1 + j10(\mathbf{I}_1 - \mathbf{I}_2) = 80 + j10(4 - 2 - j10.39)}\\ {= 183.9 + j20 = 184.984\big / 6.21^\circ \mathrm{~V~}} \end{array}
$$

The average power supplied by the current source is

$$
P_{1} = -\frac{1}{2} (184.984)(4)\cos (6.21^{\circ} - 0) = -367.8\mathrm{~W~}
$$

It is negative according to the passive sign convention, meaning that the current source is supplying power to the circuit.

For the resistor, the current through it is  $\mathbf{I}_1 = 4 / 0^\circ$  and the voltage across it is  $20\mathbf{I}_1 = 80 / 0^\circ$ , so that the power absorbed by the resistor is

$$
P_{2} = \frac{1}{2} (80)(4) = 160\mathrm{~W~}
$$

For the capacitor, the current through it is  $\mathbf{I}_{2} = 10.58 / 79.1^{\circ}$  and the voltage across it is  $- j5\mathbf{I}_{2} = (5 / - 90^{\circ})(10.58 / 79.1^{\circ}) = 52.9 / 79.1^{\circ} - 90^{\circ}$ . The average power absorbed by the capacitor is

$$
P_{4} = \frac{1}{2} (52.9)(10.58)\cos (-90^{\circ}) = 0
$$

For the inductor, the current through it is  $\mathbf{I}_{1} - \mathbf{I}_{2} = 2 - j10.39 = 10.58 / - 79.1^{\circ}$ . The voltage across it is  $j10(\mathbf{I}_{1} - \mathbf{I}_{2}) = 105.8 / - 79.1^{\circ} + 90^{\circ}$ . Hence, the average power absorbed by the inductor is

$$
P_{3} = \frac{1}{2} (105.8)(10.58)\cos 90^{\circ} = 0
$$

Notice that the inductor and the capacitor absorb zero average power and that the total power supplied by the current source equals the power absorbed by the resistor and the voltage source, or

$$
P_{1} + P_{2} + P_{3} + P_{4} + P_{5} = -367.8 + 160 + 0 + 0 + 207.8 = 0
$$

indicating that power is conserved.

Calculate the average power absorbed by each of the five elements in the circuit of Fig. 11.6.

Answer: 40- V Voltage source:  $- 60\mathrm{W}$ ;  $j20\mathrm{V}$  Voltage source:  $- 40\mathrm{W}$ ; resistor:  $100\mathrm{W}$ ; others:  $0\mathrm{W}$ .

# 11.3 Maximum Average Power Transfer

In Section 4.8 we solved the problem of maximizing the power delivered by a power- supplying resistive network to a load  $R_{L}$ . Representing the circuit by its Thevenin equivalent, we proved that the maximum power would be delivered to the load if the load resistance is equal to the Thevenin resistance  $R_{L} = R_{\mathrm{Th}}$ . We now extend that result to ac circuits.

Consider the circuit in Fig. 11.7, where an ac circuit is connected to a load  $\mathbf{Z}_{L}$  and is represented by its Thevenin equivalent. The load is usually represented by an impedance, which may model an electric motor, an antenna, a TV, and so forth. In rectangular form, the Thevenin impedance  $\mathbf{Z}_{\mathrm{Th}}$  and the load impedance  $\mathbf{Z}_{L}$  are

$$
\begin{array}{r}\mathbf{Z}_{\mathrm{Th}} = R_{\mathrm{Th}} + jX_{\mathrm{Th}} \\ \mathbf{Z}_{L} = R_{L} + jX_{L} \end{array} \tag{11.13b}
$$

The current through the load is

$$
\mathbf{I} = \frac{\mathbf{V}_{\mathrm{Th}}}{\mathbf{Z}_{\mathrm{Th}} + \mathbf{Z}_{L}} = \frac{\mathbf{V}_{\mathrm{Th}}}{(R_{\mathrm{Th}} + jX_{\mathrm{Th}}) + (R_{L} + jX_{L})} \tag{11.14}
$$

From Eq. (11.11), the average power delivered to the load is

$$
P = \frac{1}{2} |\mathbf{I}|^{2}R_{L} = \frac{|\mathbf{V}_{\mathrm{Th}}|^{2}R_{L} / 2}{(R_{\mathrm{Th}} + R_{L})^{2} + (X_{\mathrm{Th}} + X_{L})^{2}} \tag{11.15}
$$

Our objective is to adjust the load parameters  $R_{L}$  and  $X_{L}$  so that  $P$  is maximum. To do this we set  $\frac{\partial P}{\partial R_{L}}$  and  $\frac{\partial P}{\partial X_{L}}$  equal to zero. From Eq. (11.15), we obtain

$$
\frac{\partial P}{\partial X_{L}} = -\frac{|\mathbf{V}_{\mathrm{Th}}|^{2}R_{L}(X_{\mathrm{Th}} + X_{L})}{[(R_{\mathrm{Th}} + R_{L})^{2} + (X_{\mathrm{Th}} + X_{L})^{2}]^{2}} \tag{11.16a}
$$

$$
\frac{\partial P}{\partial R_{L}} = \frac{|\mathbf{V}_{\mathrm{Th}}|^{2}[(R_{\mathrm{Th}} + R_{L})^{2} + (X_{\mathrm{Th}} + X_{L})^{2} - 2R_{L}(R_{\mathrm{Th}} + R_{L})]}{2[(R_{\mathrm{Th}} + R_{L})^{2} + (X_{\mathrm{Th}} + X_{L})^{2}]^{2}} \tag{11.16b}
$$

Setting  $\frac{\partial P}{\partial X_{L}}$  to zero gives

$$
X_{L} = -X_{\mathrm{Th}} \tag{11.17}
$$

and setting  $\frac{\partial P}{\partial R_{L}}$  to zero results in

$$
R_{L} = \sqrt{R_{\mathrm{Th}}^{2} + (X_{\mathrm{Th}} + X_{L})^{2}} \tag{11.18}
$$

Combining Eqs. (11.17) and (11.18) leads to the conclusion that for maximum average power transfer,  $\mathbf{Z}_{L}$  must be selected so that  $X_{L} = - X_{\mathrm{Th}}$  and  $R_{L} = R_{\mathrm{Th}}$ , i.e.,

$$
\mathbf{Z}_{L} = R_{L} + jX_{L} = R_{\mathrm{Th}} - jX_{\mathrm{Th}} = \mathbf{Z}_{\mathrm{Th}}^{*} \tag{11.19}
$$

For maximum average power transfer, the load impedance  $\mathbf{Z}_{L}$  must be equal to the complex conjugate of the Thevenin impedance  $\mathbf{Z}_{\mathrm{Th}}$ .

This result is known as the maximum average power transfer theorem for the sinusoidal steady state. Setting  $R_{L} = R_{\mathrm{Th}}$  and  $X_{L} = - X_{\mathrm{Th}}$  in Eq. (11.15) gives us the maximum average power as

$$
P_{\mathrm{max}} = \frac{|\mathbf{V}_{\mathrm{Th}}|^{2}}{8R_{\mathrm{Th}}} \tag{11.20}
$$

In a situation in which the load is purely real, the condition for maximum power transfer is obtained from Eq. (11.18) by setting  $X_{L} = 0$ ; that is,

$$
R_{L} = \sqrt{R_{\mathrm{Th}}^{2} + X_{\mathrm{Th}}^{2}} = |\mathbf{Z}_{\mathrm{Th}}| \tag{11.21}
$$

Figure 11.7 Finding the maximum average power transfer: (a) circuit with a load, (b) the Thevenin equivalent.

When  $\mathbf{Z}_{L} = \mathbf{Z}_{\mathrm{Th}}^{*}$  we say that the load is matched to the source.

This means that for maximum average power transfer to a purely resistive load, the load impedance (or resistance) is equal to the magnitude of the Thevenin impedance.

Determine the load impedance  $\mathbf{Z}_{L}$  that maximizes the average power drawn from the circuit of Fig. 11.8. What is the maximum average power?

# Solution:

First we obtain the Thevenin equivalent at the load terminals. To get  $\mathbf{Z}_{\mathrm{Th}}$ , consider the circuit shown in Fig. 11.9(a). We find

$$
\mathbf{Z}_{\mathrm{Th}} = j5 + 4| (8 - j6) = j5 + \frac{4(8 - j6)}{4 + 8 - j6} = 2.933 + j4.467\Omega
$$

Figure 11.9 Finding the Thevenin equivalent of the circuit in Fig. 11.8.

To find  $\mathbf{V}_{\mathrm{Th}}$ , consider the circuit in Fig. 11.8(b). By voltage division,

$$
\mathbf{V}_{\mathrm{Th}} = \frac{8 - j6}{4 + 8 - j6} (10) = 7.454\big / - 10.3^{\circ}\mathrm{~V~}
$$

The load impedance draws the maximum power from the circuit when

$$
\mathbf{Z}_{L} = \mathbf{Z}_{\mathrm{Th}}^{*} = 2.933 - j4.467\Omega
$$

According to Eq. (11.20), the maximum average power is

$$
P_{\mathrm{max}} = \frac{|\mathbf{V}_{\mathrm{Th}}|^2}{8P_{\mathrm{Th}}} = \frac{(7.454)^2}{8(2.933)} = 2.368\mathrm{~W}
$$

Figure 11.10 For Practice Prob. 11.5.

For the circuit shown in Fig. 11.10, find the load impedance  $\mathbf{Z}_{L}$  that absorbs the maximum average power. Calculate that maximum average power.

Answer:  $3.415 - j0.7317\Omega$ , 51.47 W.

In the circuit in Fig. 11.11, find the value of  $R_{L}$  that will absorb the maximum average power. Calculate that power.

# Solution:

We first find the Thevenin equivalent at the terminals of  $R_{L}$

$$
\mathbf{Z}_{\mathrm{Th}} = (40 - j30)| j20 = \frac{j20(40 - j30)}{j20 + 40 - j30} = 9.412 + j22.35\Omega
$$

By voltage division,

$$
\mathbf{V}_{\mathrm{Th}} = \frac{j20}{j20 + 40 - j30} (150 / 30^{\circ}) = 72.76 / 134^{\circ}\mathbf{V}
$$

The value of  $R_{L}$  that will absorb the maximum average power is

$$
R_{L} = |\mathbf{Z}_{\mathrm{Th}}| = \sqrt{9.412^{2} + 22.35^{2}} = 24.25\Omega
$$

The current through the load is

$$
\mathbf{I} = \frac{\mathbf{V}_{\mathrm{Th}}}{\mathbf{Z}_{\mathrm{Th}} + R_{L}} = \frac{72.76 / 134^{\circ}}{33.66 + j22.35} = 1.8 / 100.42^{\circ}\mathbf{A}
$$

The maximum average power absorbed by  $R_{L}$  is

$$
P_{\mathrm{max}} = \frac{1}{2} |\mathbf{I}|^{2}R_{L} = \frac{1}{2} (1.8)^{2}(24.25) = 39.29\mathrm{~W}
$$

In Fig. 11.12, the resistor  $R_{L}$  is adjusted until it absorbs the maximum average power. Calculate  $R_{L}$  and the maximum average power absorbed by it.

# 11.4 Effective or RMS Value

The idea of effective value arises from the need to measure the effectiveness of a voltage or current source in delivering power to a resistive load.

The effective value of a periodic current is the dc current that delivers the same average power to a resistor as the periodic current.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-14/63c420e9-9220-47ad-935a-09e6b2aeb2a8/32113402355d9bfd053994376c5ad5662dc97dc3287c95638795d3ca8b234091.jpg)

Figure 11.13 Finding the effective current: (a) ac circuit, (b) dc circuit.

In Fig. 11.13, the circuit in (a) is ac while that of (b) is dc. Our objective is to find  $I_{\mathrm{eff}}$  that will transfer the same power to resistor  $R$  as the sinusoid  $i$ . The average power absorbed by the resistor in the ac circuit is

$$
P = \frac{1}{T}\int_{0}^{T}i^{2}R dt = \frac{R}{T}\int_{0}^{T}i^{2}dt \tag{11.22}
$$

while the power absorbed by the resistor in the dc circuit is

$$
P = I_{\mathrm{eff}}^{2}R \tag{11.23}
$$

Equating the expressions in Eqs. (11.22) and (11.23) and solving for  $I_{\mathrm{eff}}$ , we obtain

$$
I_{\mathrm{eff}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{T}\int_{0}^{T}i^{2}dt} \tag{11.24}
$$

The effective value of the voltage is found in the same way as current; that is,

$$
V_{\mathrm{eff}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{T}\int_{0}^{T}\nu^{2}dt} \tag{11.25}
$$

This indicates that the effective value is the (square) root of the mean (or average) of the square of the periodic signal. Thus, the effective value is often known as the root- mean- square value, or rms value for short; and we write

$$
I_{\mathrm{eff}} = I_{\mathrm{rms}}, \qquad V_{\mathrm{eff}} = V_{\mathrm{rms}} \tag{11.26}
$$

For any periodic function  $x(t)$  in general, the rms value is given by

$$
X_{\mathrm{rms}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{T}\int_{0}^{T}x^{2}dt} \tag{11.27}
$$

The effective value of a periodic signal is its root mean square (rms) value.

Equation 11.27 states that to find the rms value of  $x(t)$ , we first find its square  $x^{2}$  and then find the mean of that, or

$$
\frac{1}{T}\int_{0}^{T}x^{2}dt
$$

and then the square root  $(\sqrt{\phantom{^{2}}\phantom{^{2}}})$  of that mean. The rms value of a constant is the constant itself. For the sinusoid  $i(t) = I_{m}\cos \omega t$ , the effective or rms value is

$$
I_{\mathrm{rms}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{T}\int_{0}^{T}I_{m}^{2}\cos^{2}\omega t dt}
$$

$$
= \sqrt{\frac{I_{m}^{2}}{T}\int_{0}^{T}T\frac{1}{2}(1 + \cos 2\omega t) dt} = \frac{I_{m}}{\sqrt{2}} \tag{11.28}
$$

Similarly, for  $\nu (t) = V_{m}\cos \omega t$ ,

$$
V_{\mathrm{rms}} = \frac{V_{m}}{\sqrt{2}} \tag{11.29}
$$

Keep in mind that Eqs. (11.28) and (11.29) are only valid for sinusoidal signals.

The average power in Eq. (11.8) can be written in terms of the rms values.

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{P=\frac{1}{2}V_{m}I_{m}\cos(\theta_{\nu}-\theta_{i})=\frac{V_{m}}{\sqrt{2}}\frac{I_{m}}{\sqrt{2}}\cos(\theta_{\nu}-\theta_{i})}}\\ {{=V_{\mathrm{rms}}I_{\mathrm{rms}}\cos(\theta_{\nu}-\theta_{i})}}\end{array} \tag{11.30}
$$

Similarly, the average power absorbed by a resistor  $R$  in Eq. (11.11) can be written as

$$
P = I_{\mathrm{rms}}^{2}R = \frac{V_{\mathrm{rms}}^{2}}{R} \tag{11.31}
$$

When a sinusoidal voltage or current is specified, it is often in terms of its maximum (or peak) value or its rms value, since its average value is zero. The power industries specify phasor magnitudes in terms of their rms values rather than peak values. For instance, the  $110 \mathrm{V}$  available at every household is the rms value of the voltage from the power company. It is convenient in power analysis to express voltage and current in their rms values. Also, analog voltmeters and ammeters are designed to read directly the rms value of voltage and current, respectively.

Determine the rms value of the current waveform in Fig. 11.14. If the current is passed through a  $2 - \Omega$  resistor, find the average power absorbed by the resistor.

# Solution:

The period of the waveform is  $T = 4$ . Over a period, we can write the current waveform as

$$
i(t) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}5t, & 0< t< 2 \\ -10, & 2< t< 4 \end{array} \right.
$$

The rms value is

$$
I_{\mathrm{rms}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{T}\int_{0}^{2}i^{2}dt} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{4}\left[\int_{0}^{2}(5t)^{2}dt + \int_{2}^{4}(-10)^{2}dt\right]}
$$

$$
= \sqrt{\frac{1}{4}\left[25\frac{t^{3}}{3}t_{0}^{2} + 100t\right]_{2}^{4}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{4}\left(\frac{200}{3} + 200\right)} = 8.165\mathrm{~A~}
$$

The power absorbed by a  $2 - \Omega$  resistor is

$$
P = I_{\mathrm{rms}}^{2}R = (8.165)^{2}(2) = 133.3\mathrm{~W~}
$$

Find the rms value of the current waveform of Fig. 11.15. If the current flows through a  $9 - \Omega$  resistor, calculate the average power absorbed by the resistor.

Figure 11.16 For Example 11.8.

The waveform shown in Fig. 11.16 is a half- wave rectified sine wave. Find the rms value and the amount of average power dissipated in a  $10 - \Omega$  resistor.

# Solution:

The period of the voltage waveform is  $T = 2\pi$ , and

$$
\nu (t) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}10 \sin t, & 0 < t < \pi \\ 0, & \pi < t < 2\pi \end{array} \right.
$$

The rms value is obtained as

$$
V_{\mathrm{rms}}^{2} = \frac{1}{T} \int_{0}^{T} \nu^{2}(t) dt = \frac{1}{2\pi} \left[ \int_{0}^{\pi} (10 \sin t)^{2} dt + \int_{\pi}^{2\pi} 0^{2} dt \right]
$$

But  $\sin^{2} t = \frac{1}{2} (1 - \cos 2t)$ . Hence,

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{V_{\mathrm{rms}}^{2}=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{0}^{\pi}\frac{100}{2}(1-\cos2t)d t=\frac{50}{2\pi}\Big(t-\frac{\sin2t}{2}\Big)\Big|_{0}^{\pi}}}\\ {{=\frac{50}{2\pi}\Big(\pi-\frac{1}{2}\sin2\pi-0\Big)=25,\qquad V_{\mathrm{rms}}=5\mathrm{~V~}}}\end{array}
$$

The average power absorbed is

$$
P = \frac{V_{\mathrm{rms}}^{2}}{R} = \frac{5^{2}}{10} = 2.5 \mathrm{~W}
$$

Find the rms value of the full- wave rectified sine wave in Fig. 11.17. Calculate the average power dissipated in a  $6 - \Omega$  resistor.

Answer: 70.71 V, 833.3 W.

# 11.5 Apparent Power and Power Factor

In Section 11.2 we saw that if the voltage and current at the terminals of a circuit are

$$
\nu (t) = V_{m} \cos (\omega t + \theta_{\nu}) \qquad \text{and} \qquad i(t) = I_{m} \cos (\omega t + \theta_{i}) \tag{11.32}
$$

or, in phasor form,  $\mathbf{V} = V_{m} / \theta_{\nu}$  and  $\mathbf{I} = I_{m} / \theta_{i}$ , the average power is

$$
P = \frac{1}{2} V_{m} I_{m} \cos (\theta_{\nu} - \theta_{i}) \tag{11.33}
$$

In Section 11.4, we saw that

$$
P = V_{\mathrm{rms}} I_{\mathrm{rms}} \cos (\theta_{\nu} - \theta_{i}) = S \cos (\theta_{\nu} - \theta_{i}) \tag{11.34}
$$

We have added a new term to the equation:

$$
S = V_{\mathrm{rms}} I_{\mathrm{rms}} \tag{11.35}
$$

The average power is a product of two terms. The product  $V_{\mathrm{rms}}I_{\mathrm{rms}}$  is known as the apparent power  $S$ . The factor  $\cos (\theta_{\nu} - \theta_{i})$  is called the power factor (pf).

The apparent power (in VA) is the product of the rms values of voltage and current.

The apparent power is so called because it seems apparent that the power should be the voltage- current product, by analogy with dc resistive circuits. It is measured in volt- amperes or VA to distinguish it from the average or real power, which is measured in watts. The power factor is dimensionless, since it is the ratio of the average power to the apparent power,

$$
\mathrm{pf} = \frac{P}{S} = \cos (\theta_{\nu} - \theta_{i}) \tag{11.36}
$$

The angle  $\theta_{\nu} - \theta_{i}$  is called the power factor angle, because it is the angle whose cosine is the power factor. The power factor angle is equal to the angle of the load impedance if  $\mathbf{V}$  is the voltage across the load and  $\mathbf{I}$  is the current through it. This is evident from the fact that

$$
\mathbf{Z} = \frac{\mathbf{V}}{\mathbf{I}} = \frac{V_m / \theta_\nu}{I_m / \theta_i} = \frac{V_m}{I_m} /\theta_\nu -\theta_i \tag{11.37}
$$

Alternatively, since

$$
\mathbf{V}_{\mathrm{rms}} = \frac{\mathbf{V}}{\sqrt{2}} = V_{\mathrm{rms}} / \theta_{\nu} \tag{11.38a}
$$

and

$$
\mathbf{I}_{\mathrm{rms}} = \frac{\mathbf{I}}{\sqrt{2}} = I_{\mathrm{rms}} / \theta_{i} \tag{11.38b}
$$

the impedance is

$$
\mathbf{Z} = \frac{\mathbf{V}}{\mathbf{I}} = \frac{\mathbf{V}_{\mathrm{rms}}}{\mathbf{I}_{\mathrm{rms}}} = \frac{V_{\mathrm{rms}}}{\mathbf{I}_{\mathrm{rms}}}\big / \theta_{\nu} - \theta_{i} \tag{11.39}
$$

The power factor is the cosine of the phase difference between voltage and current. It is also the cosine of the angle of the load impedance.

From Eq. (11.36), the power factor may be seen as that factor by which the apparent power must be multiplied to obtain the real or average power. The value of pf ranges between zero and unity. For a purely resistive load, the voltage and current are in phase, so that  $\theta_{\nu} - \theta_{i} = 0$  and  $\mathrm{pf} = 1$ . This implies that the apparent power is equal to the average power. For a purely reactive load,  $\theta_{\nu} - \theta_{i} = \pm 90^{\circ}$  and  $\mathrm{pf} = 0$ . In this case the average power is zero. In between these two extreme cases,  $\mathrm{pf}$  is said to be leading or lagging. Leading power factor means that current leads voltage, which implies a capacitive load. Lagging power factor means that current lags voltage, implying an inductive load. Power factor affects

From Eq. (11.56), the power factor may also be regarded as the ratio of the real power dissipated in the load to the apparent power of the load.

the electric bills consumers pay the electric utility companies, as we will see in Section 11.9.2.

# Example 11.9

A series- connected load draws a current  $i(t) = 4 \cos (100\pi t + 10^{\circ})$  A when the applied voltage is  $\nu (t) = 120 \cos (100\pi t - 20^{\circ})$  V. Find the apparent power and the power factor of the load. Determine the element values that form the series- connected load.

# Solution:

The apparent power is

$$
S = V_{\mathrm{rms}}I_{\mathrm{rms}} = \frac{120}{\sqrt{2}}\frac{4}{\sqrt{2}} = 240\mathrm{VA}
$$

The power factor is

$$
\mathrm{pf} = \cos (\theta_{\mathrm{i}} - \theta_{i}) = \cos (-20^{\circ} - 10^{\circ}) = 0.866 \tag{leading}
$$

The pf is leading because the current leads the voltage. The pf may also be obtained from the load impedance.

$$
\mathbf{Z} = \frac{\mathbf{V}}{\mathbf{I}} = \frac{120 / - 20^{\circ}}{4\underline{{10^{\circ}}}} = 30\underline{{/ - 30^{\circ}}} = 25.98 - j15\Omega
$$

$$
\mathrm{pf} = \cos (-30^{\circ}) = 0.866 \tag{leading}
$$

The load impedance  $\mathbf{Z}$  can be modeled by a  $25.98 - \Omega$  resistor in series with a capacitor with

$$
X_{C} = -15 = -\frac{1}{\omega C}
$$

or

$$
C = \frac{1}{15\omega} = \frac{1}{15\times 100\pi} = 212.2\mu \mathrm{F}
$$

# Practice Problem 11.9

Obtain the power factor and the apparent power of a load whose impedance is  $\mathbf{Z} = 60 + j40 \Omega$  when the applied voltage is  $\nu (t) = 320 \cos (377t + 10^{\circ})$  V.

Answer: 0.8321 lagging,  $710 / 33.69^{\circ}$  VA.

# Example 11.10

Determine the power factor of the entire circuit of Fig. 11.18 as seen by the source. Calculate the average power delivered by the source.

# Solution:

The total impedance is

$$
\mathbf{Z} = 6 + 4|(-j2) = 6 + \frac{-j2\times 4}{4 - j2} = 6.8 - j1.6 = 7\big / - 13.24^{\circ}\Omega
$$

The power factor is

$$
\mathrm{pf} = \cos (-13.24) = 0.9734\qquad \mathrm{(leading)}
$$

since the impedance is capacitive. The rms value of the current is

$$
\mathbf{I}_{\mathrm{rms}} = \frac{\mathbf{V}_{\mathrm{rms}}}{\mathbf{Z}} = \frac{30 / 0^{\circ}}{7 / - 13.24^{\circ}} = 4.286 / 13.24^{\circ}\mathrm{A}
$$

The average power supplied by the source is

$$
P = V_{\mathrm{rms}}I_{\mathrm{rms}}\mathrm{pf} = (30)(4.286)0.9734 = 125\mathrm{W}
$$

or

$$
P = I_{\mathrm{rms}}^{2}R = (4.286)^{2}(6.8) = 125\mathrm{W}
$$

where  $R$  is the resistive part of  $\mathbf{Z}$ .

Calculate the power factor of the entire circuit of Fig. 11.19 as seen by the source. What is the average power supplied by the source?

Answer: 0.936 lagging, 2.008 kW.

# 11.6 Complex Power

Considerable effort has been expended over the years to express power relations as simply as possible. Power engineers have coined the term complex power, which they use to find the total effect of parallel loads. Complex power is important in power analysis because it contains all the information pertaining to the power absorbed by a given load.

Consider the ac load in Fig. 11.20. Given the phasor form  $\mathbf{V} = V_{m} / \theta_{\nu}$  and  $\mathbf{I} = I_{m} / \theta_{i}$  of voltage  $\nu (t)$  and current  $i(t)$ , the complex power S absorbed by the ac load is the product of the voltage and the complex conjugate of the current, or

$$
\mathbf{S} = \frac{1}{2}\mathbf{V}\mathbf{I}^{*} \tag{11.40}
$$

assuming the passive sign convention (see Fig. 11.20). In terms of the rms values,

$$
\mathbf{S} = \mathbf{V}_{\mathrm{rms}}\mathbf{I}_{\mathrm{rms}}^{*} \tag{11.41}
$$

where

$$
\mathbf{V}_{\mathrm{rms}} = \frac{\mathbf{V}}{\sqrt{2}} = V_{\mathrm{rms}} / \theta_{\nu} \tag{11.42}
$$

and

$$
\mathbf{I}_{\mathrm{rms}} = \frac{\mathbf{I}}{\sqrt{2}} = I_{\mathrm{rms}} / \theta_{i} \tag{11.43}
$$

Figure 11.20 The voltage and current phasors associated with a load.

When working with the rms values of currents or voltages, we may drop the subscript rms if no confusion will be caused by doing so.

Thus, we may write Eq. (11.41) as

$$
\begin{array}{r l} & {\mathbf{S} = V_{\mathrm{rms}}I_{\mathrm{rms}} / \theta_{\nu} - \theta_{i}}\\ & {\quad = V_{\mathrm{rms}}I_{\mathrm{rms}}\cos (\theta_{\nu} - \theta_{i}) + j V_{\mathrm{rms}}I_{\mathrm{rms}}\sin (\theta_{\nu} - \theta_{i})} \end{array} \tag{11.44}
$$

This equation can also be obtained from Eq. (11.9). We notice from Eq. (11.44) that the magnitude of the complex power is the apparent power; hence, the complex power is measured in volt- amperes (VA). Also, we notice that the angle of the complex power is the power factor angle.

The complex power may be expressed in terms of the load impedance  $\mathbf{Z}$ . From Eq. (11.37), the load impedance  $\mathbf{Z}$  may be written as

$$
\mathbf{Z} = \frac{\mathbf{V}}{\mathbf{I}} = \frac{\mathbf{V}_{\mathrm{rms}}}{\mathbf{I}_{\mathrm{rms}}} = \frac{V_{\mathrm{rms}}}{I_{\mathrm{rms}}} /\theta_{\nu} - \theta_{i} \tag{11.45}
$$

Thus,  $\mathbf{V}_{\mathrm{rms}} = \mathbf{Z} \mathbf{I}_{\mathrm{rms}}$ . Substituting this into Eq. (11.41) gives

$$
\mathbf{S} = I_{\mathrm{rms}}^{2} \mathbf{Z} = \frac{V_{\mathrm{rms}}^{2}}{\mathbf{Z}^{*}} = \mathbf{V}_{\mathrm{rms}} \mathbf{I}_{\mathrm{rms}}^{*} \tag{11.46}
$$

Since  $\mathbf{Z} = R + j X$ , Eq. (11.46) becomes

$$
\mathbf{S} = I_{\mathrm{rms}}^{2}(R + j X) = P + j Q \tag{11.47}
$$

where  $P$  and  $Q$  are the real and imaginary parts of the complex power; that is,

$$
\begin{array}{r}P = \mathrm{Re}(\mathbf{S}) = I_{\mathrm{rms}}^{2}R\\ Q = \mathrm{Im}(\mathbf{S}) = I_{\mathrm{rms}}^{2}X \end{array} \tag{11.49}
$$

$P$  is the average or real power and it depends on the load's resistance  $R$ .  $Q$  depends on the load's reactance  $X$  and is called the reactive (or quadrature) power.

Comparing Eq. (11.44) with Eq. (11.47), we notice that

$$
P = V_{\mathrm{rms}}I_{\mathrm{rms}}\cos (\theta_{\nu} - \theta_{i}),\qquad Q = V_{\mathrm{rms}}I_{\mathrm{rms}}\sin (\theta_{\nu} - \theta_{i}) \tag{11.50}
$$

The real power  $P$  is the average power in watts delivered to a load; it is the only useful power. It is the actual power dissipated by the load. The reactive power  $Q$  is a measure of the energy exchange between the source and the reactive part of the load. The unit of  $Q$  is the volt- ampere reactive (VAR) to distinguish it from the real power, whose unit is the watt. We know from Chapter 6 that energy storage elements neither dissipate nor supply power, but exchange power back and forth with the rest of the network. In the same way, the reactive power is being transferred back and forth between the load and the source. It represents a lossless interchange between the load and the source. Notice that:

1.  $Q = 0$  for resistive loads (unity pf).  
2.  $Q < 0$  for capacitive loads (leading pf).  
3.  $Q > 0$  for inductive loads (lagging pf).

Thus,

Complex power (in VA) is the product of the rms voltage phasor and the complex conjugate of the rms current phasor. As a complex quantity, its real part is real power  $P$  and its imaginary part is reactive power  $Q$ .

Introducing the complex power enables us to obtain the real and reactive powers directly from voltage and current phasors.

Complex Power  $= \mathbf{S} = P + jQ = \mathbf{V}_{\mathrm{rms}}(\mathbf{I}_{\mathrm{rms}})^{*}$

$$
= |\mathbf{V}_{\mathrm{rms}}|\mathbf{\Gamma}|\mathbf{I}_{\mathrm{rms}}|\mathbf{\Gamma} / \theta_{\nu} - \theta_{i}
$$

Apparent Power  $= S = |\mathbf{S}| = |\mathbf{V}_{\mathrm{rms}}|\mathbf{\Gamma}|\mathbf{I}_{\mathrm{rms}}| = \sqrt{P^{2} + Q^{2}}$

Real Power  $= P = \mathrm{Re}(\mathbf{S}) = S\cos (\theta_{\nu} - \theta_{i})$

Reactive Power  $= Q = \mathrm{Im}(\mathbf{S}) = S\sin (\theta_{\nu} - \theta_{i})$

Power Factor  $= \frac{P}{S} = \cos (\theta_{\nu} - \theta_{i})$

This shows how the complex power contains all the relevant power information in a given load.

This shows how the complex power contains all the relevant power information in a given load.It is a standard practice to represent  $\mathbf{S}$ ,  $P$ , and  $Q$  in the form of a triangle, known as the power triangle, shown in Fig. 11.21(a). This is similar to the impedance triangle showing the relationship between  $\mathbf{Z}$ ,  $R$ , and  $X$ , illustrated in Fig. 11.21(b). The power triangle has four items—the apparent/complex power, real power, reactive power, and the power factor angle. Given two of these items, the other two can easily be obtained from the triangle. As shown in Fig. 11.22, when  $\mathbf{S}$  lies in the first quadrant, we have an inductive load and a lagging  $Pf$ . When  $\mathbf{S}$  lies in the fourth quadrant, the load is capacitive and the  $Pf$  is leading. It is also possible for the complex power to lie in the second or third quadrant. This requires that the load impedance have a negative resistance, which is possible with active circuits.

S contains all power information of a load. The real part of S is the real power  $P_{i}$  its imaginary part is the reactive power  $Q_{i}$  its magnitude is the apparent power  $S_{i}$  and the cosine of its phase angle is the power factor  $p f.$

The voltage across a load is  $\nu (t) = 60\cos (\omega t - 10^{\circ})$  V and the current through the element in the direction of the voltage drop is  $i(t) = 1.5\cos (\omega t + 50^{\circ})$  A. Find: (a) the complex and apparent powers, (b) the real and reactive powers, and (c) the power factor and the load impedance.

# Solution:

(a) For the rms values of the voltage and current, we write

$$
\mathbf{V}_{\mathrm{rms}} = \frac{60}{\sqrt{2}}\underline{/ - 10^{\circ}},\qquad \mathbf{I}_{\mathrm{rms}} = \frac{1.5}{\sqrt{2}}\underline{/ + 50^{\circ}}
$$

The complex power is

$$
\mathbf{S} = \mathbf{V}_{\mathrm{rms}}\mathbf{I}_{\mathrm{rms}}^{*} = \left(\frac{60}{\sqrt{2}}\underline{/ - 10^{\circ}}\right)\left(\frac{1.5}{\sqrt{2}}\underline{/ - 50^{\circ}}\right) = 45\underline{/ - 60^{\circ}}\mathrm{VA}
$$

The apparent power is

$$
S = |\mathbf{S}| = 45\mathrm{VA}
$$

(b) We can express the complex power in rectangular form as

$$
\mathbf{S} = 45\underline{/ - 60^{\circ}} = 45[\cos (-60^{\circ}) + j\sin (-60^{\circ})] = 22.5 - j38.97
$$

Since  $\mathbf{S} = P + jQ$ , the real power is

$$
P = 22.5\mathrm{W}
$$

while the reactive power is

$$
Q = -38.97\mathrm{VAR}
$$

(c) The power factor is

$$
\mathrm{pf} = \cos (-60^{\circ}) = 0.5(\mathrm{leading})
$$

It is leading, because the reactive power is negative. The load impedance is

$$
\mathbf{Z} = \frac{\mathbf{V}}{\mathbf{I}} = \frac{60\underline{/ - 10^{\circ}}}{1.5\underline{/ + 50^{\circ}}} = 40\underline{/ - 60^{\circ}}\Omega
$$

which is a capacitive impedance.

# Practice Problem 11.11

For a load,  $\mathbf{V}_{\mathrm{rms}} = 110\underline{/85^{\circ}}\mathbf{V}$ ,  $\mathbf{I}_{\mathrm{rms}} = 400\underline{/15^{\circ}}\mathrm{mA}$ . Determine: (a) the complex and apparent powers, (b) the real and reactive powers, and (c) the power factor and the load impedance.

Answer: (a)  $44\underline{/70^{\circ}}$  VA, 44 VA, (b) 15.05 W, 41.35 VAR, (c) 0.342 lagging,  $(94.06 + j258.4)\Omega$

# Example 11.12

A load  $\mathbf{Z}$  draws  $12\mathrm{kVA}$  at a power factor of 0.856 lagging from a 120- V rms sinusoidal source. Calculate: (a) the average and reactive powers delivered to the load, (b) the peak current, and (c) the load impedance.

# Solution:

(a) Given that  $\mathrm{pf} = \cos \theta = 0.856$ , we obtain the power angle as  $\theta = \cos^{-1}0.856 = 31.13^{\circ}$ . If the apparent power is  $S = 12,000\mathrm{VA}$ , then the average or real power is

$$
P = S\cos \theta = 12,000\times 0.856 = 10.272\mathrm{kW}
$$

while the reactive power is

$$
Q = S\sin \theta = 12,000\times 0.517 = 6.204\mathrm{kVA}
$$

(b) Since the pf is lagging, the complex power is

$$
\mathbf{S} = P + jQ = 10.272 + \mathrm{j}6.204\mathrm{kVA}
$$

From  $\mathbf{S} = \mathbf{V}_{\mathrm{rms}}\mathbf{I}_{\mathrm{rms}}^{*}$  we obtain

$$
\mathbf{I}_{\mathrm{rms}}^{*} = \frac{\mathbf{S}}{\mathbf{V}_{\mathrm{rms}}} = \frac{10,272 + j6204}{120 / 0^{\circ}} = 85.6 + j51.7\mathrm{~A} = 100 / 31.13^{\circ}\mathrm{~A}
$$

Thus  $\mathbf{I}_{\mathrm{rms}} = 100 / - 31.13^{\circ}$  and the peak current is

$$
I_{m} = \sqrt{2} I_{\mathrm{rms}} = \sqrt{2} (100) = 141.4\mathrm{~A}
$$

(c) The load impedance

$$
\mathbf{Z} = \frac{\mathbf{V}_{\mathrm{rms}}}{\mathbf{I}_{\mathrm{rms}}} = \frac{120 / 0^{\circ}}{100 / - 31.13^{\circ}} = 1.2 / 31.13^{\circ}\Omega
$$

which is an inductive impedance.

A sinusoidal source supplies  $100\mathrm{kVAR}$  reactive power to load  $\mathbf{Z} =$ $250 / - 75^{\circ}\Omega$  . Determine: (a) the power factor, (b) the apparent power delivered to the load, and (c) the rms voltage.

Answer: (a) 0.2588 leading, (b)  $103.53\mathrm{kVA}$  c  $5.087\mathrm{kV}.$

# 11.7 Conservation of AC Power

The principle of conservation of power applies to ac circuits as well as to dc circuits (see Section 1.5).

To see this, consider the circuit in Fig. 11.23(a), where two load impedances  $\mathbf{Z}_{1}$  and  $\mathbf{Z}_{2}$  are connected in parallel across an ac source  $\mathbf{V}$  KCL gives

$$
\mathbf{I} = \mathbf{I}_1 + \mathbf{I}_2 \tag{11.52}
$$

The complex power supplied by the source is (from now on, unless otherwise specified, all values of voltages and currents will be assumed to be rms values)

$$
\mathbf{S} = \mathbf{V}\mathbf{I}^{*} = \mathbf{V}(\mathbf{I}_{1}^{*} + \mathbf{I}_{2}^{*}) = \mathbf{V}\mathbf{I}_{1}^{*} + \mathbf{V}\mathbf{I}_{2}^{*} = \mathbf{S}_{1} + \mathbf{S}_{2} \tag{11.53}
$$

In fact, we already saw in Examples 11.3 and 11.4 that average power is conserved in ac circuits.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-14/63c420e9-9220-47ad-935a-09e6b2aeb2a8/c81cd30a332f67a11ffd4dd9b990eb569433d94b6906a0df419d241a9c7d2559.jpg)  
Figure 11.23

An ac voltage source supplied loads connected in: (a) parallel, (b) series.

where  $\mathbf{S}_{1}$  and  $\mathbf{S}_{2}$  denote the complex powers delivered to loads  $\mathbf{Z}_{1}$  and  $\mathbf{Z}_{2}$ , respectively.

If the loads are connected in series with the voltage source, as shown in Fig. 11.23(b), KVL yields

$$
\mathbf{V} = \mathbf{V}_{1} + \mathbf{V}_{2} \tag{11.54}
$$

The complex power supplied by the source is

$$
\mathbf{S} = \mathbf{V}\mathbf{I}^{*} = (\mathbf{V}_{1} + \mathbf{V}_{2})\mathbf{I}^{*} = \mathbf{V}_{1}\mathbf{I}^{*} + \mathbf{V}_{2}\mathbf{I}^{*} = \mathbf{S}_{1} + \mathbf{S}_{2} \tag{11.55}
$$

where  $\mathbf{S}_{1}$  and  $\mathbf{S}_{2}$  denote the complex powers delivered to loads  $\mathbf{Z}_{1}$  and  $\mathbf{Z}_{2}$ , respectively.

We conclude from Eqs. (11.53) and (11.55) that whether the loads are connected in series or in parallel (or in general), the total power supplied by the source equals the total power delivered to the load. Thus, in general, for a source connected to  $N$  loads,

$$
\mathbf{S} = \mathbf{S}_{1} + \mathbf{S}_{2} + \dots +\mathbf{S}_{N} \tag{11.56}
$$

In fact, all forms of ac power are conserved: instantaneous, real, reactive, and complex.

This means that the total complex power in a network is the sum of the complex powers of the individual components. (This is also true of real power and reactive power, but not true of apparent power.) This expresses the principle of conservation of ac power:

The complex, real, and reactive powers of the sources equal the respective sums of the complex, real, and reactive powers of the individual loads.

From this we imply that the real (or reactive) power flow from sources in a network equals the real (or reactive) power flow into the other elements in the network.

\mathbf{I} = \frac{\mathbf{V}_{s}}{\mathbf{Z}} = \frac{220 / 0^{\circ}}{20.62 / - 22.83^{\circ}} = 10.67 / 22.83^{\circ}\mathrm{A}\mathrm{rms}
$$

(a) For the source, the complex power is

$$
\begin{array}{r l} & {\mathbf{S}_{s} = \mathbf{V}_{s}\mathbf{I}^{*} = (220 / 0^{\circ})(10.67 / - 22.83^{\circ})}\\ & {\qquad = 2347.4 / - 22.83^{\circ} = (2163.5 - j910.8)\mathrm{~VA}} \end{array}
$$

From this, we obtain the real power as  $2163.5\mathrm{~W}$  and the reactive power as  $910.8\mathrm{~VAR}$  (leading).

(b) For the line, the voltage is

$$
\begin{array}{r}{\mathbf{V}_{\mathrm{line}} = (4 + j2)\mathbf{I} = (4.472\big / 26.57^{\circ})(10.67\big / 22.83^{\circ})}\\ {= 47.72\big / 49.4^{\circ}\mathrm{~V~rms}} \end{array}
$$

The complex power absorbed by the line is

$$
\begin{array}{r}{\mathbf{S}_{\mathrm{line}} = \mathbf{V}_{\mathrm{line}}\mathbf{I}^{*} = (47.72\big / 49.4^{\circ})(10.67\big / - 22.83^{\circ})}\\ {= 509.2\big / 26.57^{\circ} = 455.4 + j227.7\mathrm{~VA}} \end{array}
$$

or

$$
\mathbf{S}_{\mathrm{line}} = |\mathbf{I}|^{2}\mathbf{Z}_{\mathrm{line}} = (10.67)^{2}(4 + j2) = 455.4 + j227.7\mathrm{~VA}
$$

That is, the real power is  $455.4\mathrm{~W}$  and the reactive power is  $227.76\mathrm{~VAR}$  (lagging).

(c) For the load, the voltage is

$$
\begin{array}{r}{\mathbf{V}_{L} = (15 - j10)\mathbf{I} = (18.03\big / - 33.7^{\circ})(10.67\big / 22.83^{\circ})}\\ {= 192.38\big / - 10.87^{\circ}\mathrm{~V~rms}} \end{array}
$$

The complex power absorbed by the load is

$$
\begin{array}{r}{\mathbf{S}_{L} = \mathbf{V}_{L}\mathbf{I}^{*} = (192.38\big / - 10.87^{\circ})(10.67\big / - 22.83^{\circ})}\\ {= 2053\big / - 33.7^{\circ} = (1708 - j1139)\mathrm{~VA}} \end{array}
$$

The real power is  $1708\mathrm{~W}$  and the reactive power is  $1139\mathrm{~VAR}$  (leading). Note that  $\mathbf{S}_{s} = \mathbf{S}_{\mathrm{line}} + \mathbf{S}_{L}$ , as expected. We have used the rms values of voltages and currents.

In the circuit in Fig. 11.25, the  $60 - \Omega$  resistor absorbs an average power of  $240\mathrm{~W}$ . Find  $\mathbf{V}$  and the complex power of each branch of the circuit. What is the overall complex power of the circuit? (Assume the current through the  $60 - \Omega$  resistor has no phase shift.)

Answer:  $240.7 / 21.45^{\circ}\mathrm{~V~}$  (rms); the  $20 - \Omega$  resistor:  $656\mathrm{~VA}$ ; the  $(30 - j10)\Omega$  impedance:  $480 - j160\mathrm{~VA}$ ; the  $(60 + j20)\Omega$  impedance:  $240 + j80\mathrm{~VA}$ ; overall:  $1376 - j80\mathrm{~VA}$ .

Figure 11.26 For Example 11.14.

In the circuit of Fig. 11.26,  $\mathbf{Z}_{1} = 60 / - 30^{\circ} \Omega$  and  $\mathbf{Z}_{2} = 40 / 45^{\circ} \Omega$ . Calculate the total: (a) apparent power, (b) real power, (c) reactive power, and (d) pf, supplied by the source and seen by the source.

# Solution:

The current through  $\mathbf{Z}_{1}$  is

$$
\mathbf{I}_{1} = \frac{\mathbf{V}}{\mathbf{Z}_{1}} = \frac{120 / 10^{\circ}}{60 / - 30^{\circ}} = 2 / 40^{\circ} \mathrm{A} \mathrm{rms}
$$

while the current through  $\mathbf{Z}_{2}$  is

$$
\mathbf{I}_{2} = \frac{\mathbf{V}}{\mathbf{Z}_{2}} = \frac{120 / 10^{\circ}}{40 / 45^{\circ}} = 3 / - 35^{\circ} \mathrm{A} \mathrm{rms}
$$

The complex powers absorbed by the impedances are

$$
\begin{array}{l}{{\bf S}_{1}=\frac{V_{\mathrm{rms}}^{2}}{\bf Z_{1}^{*}}=\frac{(120)^{2}}{60/30^{\circ}}=240\underline{{/}}-30^{\circ}=207.85-j120\mathrm{~VA}}\\ {{\bf S}_{2}=\frac{V_{\mathrm{rms}}^{2}}{\bf Z_{2}^{*}}=\frac{(120)^{2}}{40\underline{{/}}-45^{\circ}}=360\underline{{/}}45^{\circ}=254.6+j254.6\mathrm{~VA}}\end{array}
$$

The total complex power is

$$
\mathbf{S}_{t} = \mathbf{S}_{1} + \mathbf{S}_{2} = 462.4 + j134.6 \mathrm{VA}
$$

(a) The total apparent power is

$$
|\mathbf{S}_{t}| = \sqrt{462.4^{2} + 134.6^{2}} = 481.6 \mathrm{VA}.
$$

(b) The total real power is

$$
P_{t} = \mathrm{Re}(\mathbf{S}_{t}) = 462.4 \mathrm{W} \mathrm{or} P_{t} = P_{1} + P_{2}.
$$

(c) The total reactive power is

$$
Q_{t} = \mathrm{Im}(\mathbf{S}_{t}) = 134.6 \mathrm{VAR} \mathrm{or} Q_{t} = Q_{1} + Q_{2}.
$$

(d) The  $\mathrm{pf} = P_{t} / |\mathbf{S}_{t}| = 462.4 / 481.6 = 0.96$  (lagging).

We may cross check the result by finding the complex power  $\mathbf{S}_{s}$  supplied by the source.

$$
\begin{array}{r l} & {\mathbf{I}_{t} = \mathbf{I}_{1} + \mathbf{I}_{2} = (1.532 + j1.286) + (2.457 - j1.721)}\\ & {\qquad = 4 - j0.435 = 4.024\underline{{/}} -6.21^{\circ}\mathrm{~A~rms}}\\ & {\qquad \mathbf{S}_{s} = \mathbf{V}\mathbf{I}_{t}^{*} = (120 / 10^{\circ})(4.024 / 6.21^{\circ})}\\ & {\qquad = 482.88\underline{{/}} 16.21^{\circ} = 463 + j135 \mathrm{VA}} \end{array}
$$

which is the same as before.

Answer: 0.9972 (leading),  $6 - j0.4495 \mathrm{kVA}$ .

# 11.8 Power Factor Correction

11.8 Power Factor CorrectionMost domestic loads (such as washing machines, air conditioners, and refrigerators) and industrial loads (such as induction motors) are inductive and operate at a low lagging power factor. Although the inductive nature of the load cannot be changed, we can increase its power factor.

The process of increasing the power factor without altering the voltage or current to the original load is known as power factor correction.

The process of increasing the power factor without altering the voltage or current to the original load is known as power factor correction.Since most loads are inductive, as shown in Fig. 11.27(a), a load's power factor is improved or corrected by deliberately installing a capacitor in parallel with the load, as shown in Fig. 11.27(b). The effect of adding the capacitor can be illustrated using either the power triangle or the phasor diagram of the currents involved. Figure 11.28 shows the latter, where it is assumed that the circuit in Fig. 11.27(a) has a power factor of  $\cos \theta_{1}$ , while the one in Fig. 11.27(b) has a power factor of  $\cos \theta_{2}$ . It is evident from Fig. 11.28 that adding the capacitor has caused the phase angle between the supplied voltage and current to reduce from  $\theta_{1}$  to  $\theta_{2}$ , thereby increasing the power factor. We also notice from the magnitudes of the vectors in Fig. 11.28 that with the same supplied voltage, the circuit in Fig. 11.27(a) draws larger current  $I_{L}$  than the current  $I$  drawn by the circuit in Fig. 11.27(b). Power companies charge more for larger currents, because they result in increased power losses (by a squared factor, since  $P = I_{L}^{2}R$ ). Therefore, it is beneficial to both the power company and the consumer that every effort is made to minimize current level or keep the power factor as close to unity as possible. By choosing a suitable size for the capacitor, the current can be made to be completely in phase with the voltage, implying unity power factor.

Alternatively, power factor correction may be viewed as the addition of a reactive element (usually a capacitor) in parallel with the load in order to make the power factor closer to unity.

An inductive load is modeled as a series combination of an inductor and a resistor.

Figure 11.28 Phasor diagram showing the effect of adding a capacitor in parallel with the inductive load.

We can look at the power factor correction from another perspective. Consider the power triangle in Fig. 11.29. If the original inductive load has apparent power  $S_{1}$ , then

$$
P = S_{1}\cos \theta_{1},\qquad Q_{1} = S_{1}\sin \theta_{1} = P\tan \theta_{1} \tag{11.57}
$$

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-14/63c420e9-9220-47ad-935a-09e6b2aeb2a8/73de615125caa6ba62f0ba6e28b7c89d41f611f04bd6e26cfe1b457eaf759edb.jpg)  
Figure 11.29 Power triangle illustrating power factor correction.

If we desire to increase the power factor from cos  $\theta_{1}$  to cos  $\theta_{2}$  without altering the real power (i.e.,  $P = S_{2}\cos \theta_{2}$ ), then the new reactive power is

$$
Q_{2} = P\tan \theta_{2} \tag{11.58}
$$

The reduction in the reactive power is caused by the shunt capacitor; that is,

$$
Q_{C} = Q_{1} - Q_{2} = P(\tan \theta_{1} - \tan \theta_{2}) \tag{11.59}
$$

But from Eq. (11.46),  $Q_{C} = V_{\mathrm{rms}}^{2} / X_{C} = \omega C V_{\mathrm{rms}}^{2}$ . The value of the required shunt capacitance  $C$  is determined as

$$
C = \frac{Q_{C}}{\omega V_{\mathrm{rms}}^{2}} = \frac{P(\tan\theta_{1} - \tan\theta_{2})}{\omega V_{\mathrm{rms}}^{2}} \tag{11.60}
$$

Note that the real power  $P$  dissipated by the load is not affected by the power factor correction because the average power due to the capacitance is zero.

Although the most common situation in practice is that of an inductive load, it is also possible that the load is capacitive; that is, the load is operating at a leading power factor. In this case, an inductor should be connected across the load for power factor correction. The required shunt inductance  $L$  can be calculated from

$$
Q_{L} = \frac{V_{\mathrm{rms}}^{2}}{X_{L}} = \frac{V_{\mathrm{rms}}^{2}}{\omega L}\qquad \Rightarrow \qquad L = \frac{V_{\mathrm{rms}}^{2}}{\omega Q_{L}} \tag{11.61}
$$

where  $Q_{L} = Q_{1} - Q_{2}$ , the difference between the new and old reactive powers.

# Example 11.15

When connected to a 120- V (rms), 60- Hz power line, a load absorbs 4 kW at a lagging power factor of 0.8. Find the value of capacitance necessary to raise the pf to 0.95.

# Solution:

If the  $\mathrm{pf} = 0.8$ , then

$$
\cos \theta_{1} = 0.8\qquad \Rightarrow \qquad \theta_{1} = 36.87^{\circ}
$$

where  $\theta_{1}$  is the phase difference between voltage and current. We obtain the apparent power from the real power and the pf as

$$
S_{1} = \frac{P}{\cos\theta_{1}} = \frac{4000}{0.8} = 5000\mathrm{VA}
$$

The reactive power is

$$
Q_{1} = S_{1}\sin \theta = 5000\sin 36.87 = 3000\mathrm{VAR}
$$

When the pf is raised to 0.95,

$$
\cos \theta_{2} = 0.95\qquad \Rightarrow \qquad \theta_{2} = 18.19^{\circ}
$$

The real power  $P$  has not changed. But the apparent power has changed; its new value is

$$
S_{2} = \frac{P}{\cos\theta_{2}} = \frac{4000}{0.95} = 4210.5\mathrm{VA}
$$

The new reactive power is

$$
Q_{2} = S_{2}\sin \theta_{2} = 1314.4\mathrm{VAR}
$$

The difference between the new and old reactive powers is due to the parallel addition of the capacitor to the load. The reactive power due to the capacitor is

$$
Q_{C} = Q_{1} - Q_{2} = 3000 - 1314.4 = 1685.6\mathrm{VAR}
$$

and

$$
C = \frac{Q_C}{\omega V_{\mathrm{rms}}^2} = \frac{1685.6}{2\pi\times 60\times 120^2} = 310.5\mu \mathrm{F}
$$

Note: Capacitors are normally purchased for voltages they expect to see. In this case, the maximum voltage this capacitor will see is about  $170\mathrm{V}$  peak. We would suggest purchasing a capacitor with a voltage rating equal to, say,  $200\mathrm{V}$

Find the value of parallel capacitance needed to correct a load of  $140\mathrm{kVAR}$  at 0.85 lagging pf to unity pf. Assume that the load is supplied by a 110- V (rms), 60- Hz line.

Answer:  $30.69~\mathrm{mF}$

# 11.9 Applications

In this section, we consider two important application areas: how power is measured and how electric utility companies determine the cost of electricity consumption.

# 11.9.1 Power Measurement

The average power absorbed by a load is measured by an instrument called the wattmeter.

The wattmeter is the instrument used for measuring the average power.

Figure 11.30 shows a wattmeter that consists essentially of two coils: the current coil and the voltage coil. A current coil with very low impedance (ideally zero) is connected in series with the load (Fig. 11.31) and responds to the load current. The voltage coil with very high impedance (ideally infinite) is connected in parallel with the load as shown in Fig. 11.31 and responds to the load voltage. The current coil acts like a short circuit because of its low impedance; the voltage

Reactive power is measured by an instrument called the varmeter. The varmeter is often connected to the load in the same way as the wattmeter.

Some wattmeters do not have coils; the wattmeter considered here is the electromagnetic type.

Figure 11.31 The wattmeter connected to the load.

coil behaves like an open circuit because of its high impedance. As a result, the presence of the wattmeter does not disturb the circuit or have an effect on the power measurement.

When the two coils are energized, the mechanical inertia of the moving system produces a deflection angle that is proportional to the average value of the product  $\nu (t)i(t)$ . If the current and voltage of the load are  $\nu (t) = V_{m}\cos (\omega t + \theta_{\nu})$  and  $i(t) = I_{m}\cos (\omega t + \theta_{i})$ , their corresponding rms phasors are

$$
\mathbf{V}_{\mathrm{rms}} = \frac{V_m}{\sqrt{2}}\big / \theta_\nu \qquad \mathrm{and}\qquad \mathbf{I}_{\mathrm{rms}} = \frac{I_m}{\sqrt{2}}\big / \theta_\nu \tag{11.62}
$$

and the wattmeter measures the average power given by

$$
P\equiv |\mathbf{V}_{\mathrm{rms}}|\mathbf{I}_{\mathrm{rms}}|\cos (\theta_{\nu} - \theta_{i}) = V_{\mathrm{rms}}I_{\mathrm{rms}}\cos (\theta_{\nu} - \theta_{i}) \tag{11.63}
$$

As shown in Fig. 11.31, each wattmeter coil has two terminals with one marked  $\pm$ . To ensure upscale deflection, the  $\pm$  terminal of the current coil is toward the source, while the  $\pm$  terminal of the voltage coil is connected to the same line as the current coil. Reversing both coil connections still results in upscale deflection. However, reversing one coil and not the other results in downscale deflection and no wattmeter reading.

# Example 11.16

Figure 11.32 For Example 11.16.

# Solution:

1. Define. The problem is clearly defined. Interestingly, this is a problem where the student could actually validate the results by doing the problem in the laboratory with a real wattmeter.

2. Present. This problem consists of finding the average power delivered to a load by an external source with a series impedance.

3. Alternative. This is a straightforward circuit problem where all we need to do is find the magnitude and phase of the current through the load and the magnitude and the phase of the voltage across the load. These quantities could also be found by using PSpice, which we will use as a check.

4. Attempt. In Fig. 11.32, the wattmeter reads the average power absorbed by the  $(8 - j6)\Omega$  impedance because the current coil is in series with the impedance while the voltage coil is in parallel with it. The current through the circuit is

$$
\mathbf{I}_{\mathrm{rms}} = \frac{150 / 0^{\circ}}{(12 + j10) + (8 - j6)} = \frac{150}{20 + j4}\mathrm{A}
$$

The voltage across the  $(8 - j6)\Omega$  impedance is

$$
\mathbf{V}_{\mathrm{rms}} = \mathbf{I}_{\mathrm{rms}}(8 - j6) = \frac{150(8 - j6)}{20 + j4}\mathbf{V}
$$

The complex power is

$$
{\bf S} = {\bf V}_{\mathrm{rms}}{\bf I}_{\mathrm{rms}}^{*} = \frac{150(8 - j6)}{20 + j4}\cdot \frac{150}{20 - j4} = \frac{150^{2}(8 - j6)}{20^{2} + 4^{2}} = 423.7 - j324.6\mathrm{~VA}
$$

The wattmeter reads

$$
P = \mathrm{Re}(\mathbf{S}) = 432.7\mathbf{W}
$$

5. Evaluate. We can check our results by using PSpice.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-14/63c420e9-9220-47ad-935a-09e6b2aeb2a8/bac81d4c055d94fbc65d5e9dfb482d1470d1642558b113ddead92aabd0a4f6a6.jpg)

Simulation yields:

FREQ IM(V_PRINT2) IP(V_PRINT2) 1.592E- 01 7.354E+00 - 1.131E+01

and

FREQ VM(\$N_0004) VP(\$N_0004) 1.592E- 01 7.354E+01 - 4.818E+01

To check our answer, all we need is the magnitude of the current (7.354 A) flowing through the load resistor:

$$
P = (I_L)^2 R = (7.354)^2 8 = 432.7\mathbf{W}
$$

As expected, the answer does check!

6. Satisfactory? We have satisfactorily solved the problem and the results can now be presented as a solution to the problem.

Answer: 1.437 kW.

# 11.9.2 Electricity Consumption Cost

In Section 1.7, we considered a simplified model of the way the cost of electricity consumption is determined. But the concept of power factor was not included in the calculations. Now we consider the importance of power factor in electricity consumption cost.

Loads with low power factors are costly to serve because they require large currents, as explained in Section 11.8. The ideal situation would be to draw minimum current from a supply so that  $S = P$ ,  $Q = 0$ , and  $\mathrm{pf} = 1$ . A load with nonzero  $Q$  means that energy flows back and forth between the load and the source, giving rise to additional power losses. In view of this, power companies often encourage their customers to have power factors as close to unity as possible and penalize some customers who do not improve their load power factors.

Utility companies divide their customers into categories: as residential (domestic), commercial, and industrial, or as small power, medium power, and large power. They have different rate structures for each category. The amount of energy consumed in units of kilowatthours (kWh) is measured using a kilowatt- hour meter installed at the customer's premises.

Although utility companies use different methods for charging customers, the tariff or charge to a consumer is often two- part. The first part is fixed and corresponds to the cost of generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity to meet the load requirements of the consumers. This part of the tariff is generally expressed as a certain

price per kW of maximum demand. Or it may be based on kVA of maximum demand, to account for the power factor (pf) of the consumer. A pf penalty charge may be imposed on the consumer whereby a certain percentage of kW or kVA maximum demand is charged for every 0.01 fall in pf below a prescribed value, say 0.85 or 0.9. On the other hand, a pf credit may be given for every 0.01 that the pf exceeds the prescribed value.

The second part is proportional to the energy consumed in kWh; it may be in graded form, for example, the first  $100\mathrm{kWh}$  at 16 cents/ kWh, the next  $200\mathrm{kWh}$  at 10 cents/kWh and so forth. Thus, the bill is determined based on the following equation:

$$
\mathrm{TotalCost} = \mathrm{FixedCost} + \mathrm{CostofEnergy} \tag{11.64}
$$

A manufacturing industry consumes  $200\mathrm{MWh}$  in one month. If the maximum demand is  $1,600\mathrm{kW}$ , calculate the electricity bill based on the following two- part rate:

Demand charge: \(\) 5.00\(per month per kW of billing demand.

Energy charge: 8 cents per kWh for the first  $50,000\mathrm{kWh}$ , 5 cents per kWh for the remaining energy.

# Solution:

The demand charge is

$$
\$ 5.00\times 1,600 = \$ 8,000 \tag{11.17.1}
$$

The energy charge for the first  $50,000\mathrm{kWh}$  is

$$
\$ 0.08\times 50,000 = \$ 4,000 \tag{11.17.2}
$$

The remaining energy is  $200,000\mathrm{kWh} - 50,000\mathrm{kWh} = 150,000\mathrm{kWh}$ , and the corresponding energy charge is

$$
\$ 0.05\times 150,000 = \$ 7,500 \tag{11.17.3}
$$

Adding the results of Eqs. (11.17.1) to (11.17.3) gives

Total bill for the month  $=$  8,000+\ $4,000+$  7,500=\$ 19,500

It may appear that the cost of electricity is too high. But this is often a small fraction of the overall cost of production of the goods manufactured or the selling price of the finished product.

The monthly reading of a paper mill's meter is as follows:

Maximum demand:  $32,000\mathrm{kW}$  Energy consumed:  $500\mathrm{MWh}$

Using the two- part rate in Example 11.17, calculate the monthly bill for the paper mill.

Answer: \(\) 186,500$

# Example 11.18

A 300- kW load supplied at  $13\mathrm{kV}$  (rms) operates 520 hours a month at 80 percent power factor. Calculate the average cost per month based on this simplified tariff:

Energy charge: 6 cents per kWh Power- factor penalty: 0.1 percent of energy charge for every 0.01 that pf falls below 0.85. Power- factor credit: 0.1 percent of energy charge for every 0.01 that pf exceeds 0.85.

# Solution:

The energy consumed is

$$
W = 300\mathrm{kW}\times 520\mathrm{h} = 156,000\mathrm{kWh}
$$

The operating power factor  $\mathrm{pf} = 80\% = 0.8$  is  $5\times 0.01$  below the prescribed power factor of 0.85. Since there is 0.1 percent energy charge for every 0.01, there is a power- factor penalty charge of 0.5 percent. This amounts to an energy charge of

$$
\Delta W = 156,000\times \frac{5\times 0.1}{100} = 780\mathrm{kWh}
$$

The total energy is

$$
W_{t} = W + \Delta W = 156,000 + 780 = 156,780\mathrm{kWh}
$$

The cost per month is given by

$$
\mathrm{Cost} = 6\mathrm{cents}\times W_t = \S 0.06\times 156,780 = \S 9,406.80
$$

# Practice Problem 11.18

An 800- kW induction furnace at 0.88 power factor operates 20 hours per day for 26 days in a month. Determine the electricity bill per month based on the tariff in Example 11.18.

Answer: \(\) 24,885.12$

# 11.10 Summary

1. The instantaneous power absorbed by an element is the product of the element's terminal voltage and the current through the element:

$$
p = \nu i.
$$

2. Average or real power  $P$  (in watts) is the average of instantaneous power  $p$

$$
P = \frac{1}{T}\int_{0}^{T}p dt
$$

If  $\nu (t) = V_{m}\cos (\omega t + \theta_{\nu})$  and  $i(t) = I_{m}\cos (\omega t + \theta_{i})$  then  $V_{\mathrm{rms}} = V_{m} / \sqrt{2}$ $I_{\mathrm{rms}} = I_{m} / \sqrt{2}$  , and

$$
P = \frac{1}{2} V_{m}I_{m}\cos (\theta_{\nu} - \theta_{i}) = V_{\mathrm{rms}}I_{\mathrm{rms}}\cos (\theta_{\nu} - \theta_{i})
$$

Inductors and capacitors absorb no average power, while the average power absorbed by a resistor is  $(1 / 2)I_{m}^{2}R = I_{\mathrm{rms}}^{2}R$ .

3. Maximum average power is transferred to a load when the load impedance is the complex conjugate of the Thevenin impedance as seen from the load terminals,  $\mathbf{Z}_L = \mathbf{Z}_{\mathrm{Th}}^*$ .

4. The effective value of a periodic signal  $\mathbf{x}(t)$  is its root-mean-square (rms) value.

$$
X_{\mathrm{eff}} = X_{\mathrm{rms}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{T}\int_{0}^{T}x^{2}dt}
$$

For a sinusoid, the effective or rms value is its amplitude divided by  $\sqrt{2}$ .

5. The power factor is the cosine of the phase difference between voltage and current:

$$
\mathrm{pf} = \cos (\theta_{\nu} - \theta_{i})
$$

It is also the cosine of the angle of the load impedance or the ratio of real power to apparent power. The  $\mathrm{pf}$  is lagging if the current lags voltage (inductive load) and is leading when the current leads voltage (capacitive load).

6. Apparent power  $S$  (in VA) is the product of the rms values of voltage and current:

$$
S = V_{\mathrm{rms}}I_{\mathrm{rms}}
$$

It is also given by  $S = |S| = \sqrt{P^2 + Q^2}$ , where  $P$  is the real power and  $Q$  is reactive power.

7. Reactive power (in VAR) is:

$$
Q = \frac{1}{2} V_{m}I_{m}\sin (\theta_{\nu} - \theta_{i}) = V_{\mathrm{rms}}I_{\mathrm{rms}}\sin (\theta_{\nu} - \theta_{i})
$$

8. Complex power  $\mathbf{S}$  (in VA) is the product of the rms voltage phasor and the complex conjugate of the rms current phasor. It is also the complex sum of real power  $P$  and reactive power  $Q$ .

$$
\mathbf{S} = \mathbf{V}_{\mathrm{rms}}\mathbf{I}_{\mathrm{rms}}^{*} = V_{\mathrm{rms}}I_{\mathrm{rms}} / \theta_{\nu} - \theta_{i} = P + jQ
$$

Also,

$$
\mathbf{S} = I_{\mathrm{rms}}^{2}\mathbf{Z} = \frac{V_{\mathrm{rms}}^{2}}{\mathbf{Z}^{*}}
$$

9. The total complex power in a network is the sum of the complex powers of the individual components. Total real power and reactive power are also, respectively, the sums of the individual real powers and the reactive powers, but the total apparent power is not calculated by the process.

10. Power factor correction is necessary for economic reasons; it is the process of improving the power factor of a load by reducing the overall reactive power.

11. The wattmeter is the instrument for measuring the average power. Energy consumed is measured with a kilowatt-hour meter.

# Enhancing Your Skills and Your Career

# ABET EC 2000 criteria (3.e), "an ability to identify, formulate, and solve engineering problems."

Developing and enhancing your "ability to identify, formulate, and solve engineering problems" is a primary focus of textbook. Following our six- step problem- solving process is the best way to practice this skill. Our recommendation is that you use this process whenever possible. You may be pleased to learn that this process works well for nonengineering courses.

# ABET EC 2000 criteria (f), "an understanding of professional and ethical responsibility."

"An understanding of professional and ethical responsibility" is required of every engineer. To some extent, this understanding is very personal for each of us. Let us identify some pointers to help you develop this understanding. One of my favorite examples is that an engineer has the responsibility to answer what I call the "unasked question." For instance, assume that you own a car that has a problem with the transmission. In the process of selling that car, the prospective buyer asks you if there is a problem in the right- front wheel bearing. You answer no. However, as an engineer, you are required to inform the buyer that there is a problem with the transmission without being asked.

Your responsibility both professionally and ethically is to perform in a manner that does not harm those around you and to whom you are responsible. Clearly, developing this capability will take time and maturity on your part. I recommend practicing this by looking for professional and ethical components in your day- to- day activities.

# 12.1 Introduction

Historical note: Thomas Edison invented a three- wire system, using three wires instead of four.

So far in this text, we have dealt with single- phase circuits. A single- phase ac power system consists of a generator connected through a pair of wires (a transmission line) to a load. Figure 12.1(a) depicts a single- phase two- wire system, where  $V_{p}$  is the rms magnitude of the source voltage and  $\phi$  is the phase. What is more common in practice is a single- phase three- wire system, shown in Fig. 12.1(b). It contains two identical sources (equal magnitude and the same phase) that are connected to two loads by two outer wires and the neutral. For example, the normal household system is a single- phase three- wire system because the terminal voltages have the same magnitude and the same phase. Such a system allows the connection of both 120- and 240- V appliances.

Figure 12.2 Two-phase three-wire system.

Circuits or systems in which the ac sources operate at the same frequency but different phases are known as polyphase. Figure 12.2 shows a two- phase three- wire system, and Fig. 12.3 shows a three- phase four- wire system. As distinct from a single- phase system, a two- phase system is produced by a generator consisting of two coils placed perpendicular to each other so that the voltage generated by one lags the other by  $90^{\circ}$ . By the same token, a three- phase system is produced by a generator consisting of three sources having the same amplitude and frequency but out of phase with each other by  $120^{\circ}$ . Because the three- phase system is by far the most prevalent and most economical poly- phase system, discussion in this chapter is mainly on three- phase systems.

Three- phase systems are important for at least three reasons. First, nearly all electric power is generated and distributed in three- phase,

# Historical

Nikola Tesla (1856- 1943) was a Croatian- American engineer whose inventions- among them the induction motor and the first polyphase ac power system- greatly influenced the settlement of the ac versus dc debate in favor of ac. He was also responsible for the adoption of  $60\mathrm{Hz}$  as the standard for ac power systems in the United States.

Born in Austria- Hungary (now Croatia), to a clergyman, Tesla had an incredible memory and a keen affinity for mathematics. He moved to the United States in 1884 and first worked for Thomas Edison. At that time, the country was in the "battle of the currents" with George Westinghouse (1846- 1914) promoting ac and Thomas Edison rigidly leading the dc forces. Tesla left Edison and joined Westinghouse because of his interest in ac. Through Westinghouse, Tesla gained the reputation and acceptance of his polyphase ac generation, transmission, and distribution system. He held 700 patents in his lifetime. His other inventions include high- voltage apparatus (the tesla coil) and a wireless transmission system. The unit of magnetic flux density, the tesla, was named in honor of him.

at the operating frequency of  $60\mathrm{Hz}$  (or  $\omega = 377$  rad/s) in the United States or  $50\mathrm{Hz}$  (or  $\omega = 314$  rad/s) in some other parts of the world. When one- phase or two- phase inputs are required, they are taken from the three- phase system rather than generated independently. Even when more than three phases are needed- such as in the aluminum industry, where 48 phases are required for melting purposes- they can be provided by manipulating the three phases supplied. Second, the instantaneous power in a three- phase system can be constant (not pulsating), as we will see in Section 12.7. This results in uniform power transmission and less vibration of three- phase machines. Third, for the same amount of power, the three- phase system is more economical than the single- phase. The amount of wire required for a three- phase system is less than that required for an equivalent single- phase system.

We begin with a discussion of balanced three- phase voltages. Then we analyze each of the four possible configurations of balanced three- phase systems. We also discuss the analysis of unbalanced three- phase systems. We learn how to use PSpice for Windows to analyze a balanced or unbalanced three- phase system. Finally, we apply the concepts developed in this chapter to three- phase power measurement and residential electrical wiring.

# 12.2 Balanced Three-Phase Voltages

Three- phase voltages are often produced with a three- phase ac generator (or alternator) whose cross- sectional view is shown in Fig. 12.4. The generator basically consists of a rotating magnet (called the rotor) surrounded by a stationary winding (called the stator). Three separate windings or coils with terminals  $a - a^{\prime}$ ,  $b - b^{\prime}$ , and  $c - c^{\prime}$  are physically placed  $120^{\circ}$  apart around the stator. Terminals  $a$  and  $a^{\prime}$ , for example, stand for one of the ends of coils going into and the other end coming out of the

page. As the rotor rotates, its magnetic field "cuts" the flux from the three coils and induces voltages in the coils. Because the coils are placed  $120^{\circ}$  apart, the induced voltages in the coils are equal in magnitude but out of phase by  $120^{\circ}$  (Fig. 12.5). Since each coil can be regarded as a single- phase generator by itself, the three- phase generator can supply power to both single- phase and three- phase loads.

A typical three- phase system consists of three voltage sources connected to loads by three or four wires (or transmission lines). (Three- phase current sources are very scarce.) A three- phase system is equivalent to three single- phase circuits. The voltage sources can be either wye- connected as shown in Fig. 12.6(a) or delta- connected as in Fig. 12.6(b).

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-14/63c420e9-9220-47ad-935a-09e6b2aeb2a8/973c7d45d8de1d2b8459c34a1123c8bd870461455cfea8a5b27f6ee54064a0f0.jpg)  
Figure 12.6 Three-phase voltage sources: (a) Y-connected source, (b)  $\Delta$ -connected source.

Let us consider the wye- connected voltages in Fig. 12.6(a) for now. The voltages  $\mathbf{V}_{an}$ ,  $\mathbf{V}_{bn}$ , and  $\mathbf{V}_{cn}$  are respectively between lines  $a$ ,  $b$ , and  $c$ , and the neutral line  $n$ . These voltages are called phase voltages. If the voltage sources have the same amplitude and frequency  $\omega$  and are out of phase with each other by  $120^{\circ}$ , the voltages are said to be balanced. This implies that

$$
\begin{array}{c}\mathbf{V}_{an} + \mathbf{V}_{bn} + \mathbf{V}_{cn} = 0 \\ |\mathbf{V}_{an}| = |\mathbf{V}_{bn}| = |\mathbf{V}_{cn}| \end{array} \tag{12.1}
$$

As a common tradition in power systems, voltage and current in this chapter are in rms values unless otherwise stated.

Thus,

Balanced phase voltages are equal in magnitude and are out of phase with each other by  $120^{\circ}$ .

Because the three- phase voltages are  $120^{\circ}$  out of phase with each other, there are two possible combinations. One possibility is shown in Fig. 12.7(a) and expressed mathematically as

$$
\begin{array}{l}\mathbf{V}_{an} = V_p\big / 0^\circ \\ \mathbf{V}_{bn} = V_p\big / - 120^\circ \\ \mathbf{V}_{cn} = V_p\big / - 240^\circ = V_p\big / + 120^\circ \end{array} \tag{12.3}
$$

where  $V_{p}$  is the effective or rms value of the phase voltages. This is known as the abc sequence or positive sequence. In this phase sequence,  $\mathbf{V}_{an}$  leads  $\mathbf{V}_{bn}$ , which in turn leads  $\mathbf{V}_{cn}$ . This sequence is produced when the rotor in Fig. 12.4 rotates counterclockwise. The other possibility is shown in Fig. 12.7(b) and is given by

$$
\begin{array}{l}\mathbf{V}_{an} = V_p\big / 0^\circ \\ \mathbf{V}_{cn} = V_p\big / - 120^\circ \\ \mathbf{V}_{bn} = V_p\big / - 240^\circ = V_p\big / + 120^\circ \end{array} \tag{12.4}
$$

This is called the  $abc$  sequence or negative sequence. For this phase sequence,  $\mathbf{V}_{an}$  leads  $\mathbf{V}_{bn}$ , which in turn leads  $\mathbf{V}_{bn}$ . The  $abc$  sequence is produced when the rotor in Fig. 12.4 rotates in the clockwise direction. It is easy to show that the voltages in Eqs. (12.3) or (12.4) satisfy Eqs. (12.1) and (12.2). For example, from Eq. (12.3),

$$
\begin{array}{r l} & {\mathbf{V}_{a n} + \mathbf{V}_{b n} + \mathbf{V}_{c n} = V_{p}\big / 0^{\circ} + V_{p}\big / - 120^{\circ} + V_{p}\big / + 120^{\circ}}\\ & {\qquad = V_{p}(1.0 - 0.5 - j0.866 - 0.5 + j0.866)}\\ & {\qquad = 0} \end{array} \tag{12.5}
$$

The phase sequence is the time order in which the voltages pass through their respective maximum values.

The phase sequence is determined by the order in which the pha- . sors pass through a fixed point in the phase diagram.

In Fig. 12.7(a), as the phasors rotate in the counterclockwise direction with frequency  $\omega$ , they pass through the horizontal axis in a sequence  $abcabca \ldots$ . Thus, the sequence is  $abc$  or  $bca$  or  $cab$ . Similarly, for the phasors in Fig. 12.7(b), as they rotate in the counterclockwise direction, they pass the horizontal axis in a sequence  $acbaba \ldots$ . This describes the  $acb$  sequence. The phase sequence is important in three- phase power distribution. It determines the direction of the rotation of a motor connected to the power source, for example.

Like the generator connections, a three- phase load can be either wye- connected or delta- connected, depending on the end application. Figure 12.8(a) shows a wye- connected load, and Fig. 12.8(b) shows a delta- connected load. The neutral line in Fig. 12.8(a) may or may not be there, depending on whether the system is four- or three- wire. (And, of course, a neutral connection is topologically impossible for a delta connection.) A wye- or delta- connected load is said to be unbalanced if the phase impedances are not equal in magnitude or phase.

Figure 12.7 Phase sequences: (a)  $abc$  or positive sequence, (b)  $acb$  or negative sequence.

The phase sequence may also be regarded as the order in which the phase voltages reach their peak (or maximum) values with respect to time.

Reminder: As time increases, each phasor (or sinor) rotates at an angular velocity  $\omega$ .

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-14/63c420e9-9220-47ad-935a-09e6b2aeb2a8/2015116097080b0067234de0a69021f0d18df38e591a8b311d42c6e41c98200e.jpg)  
Figure 12.8 Two possible three-phase load configurations: (a) a Y-connected load, (b) a  $\Delta$ -connected load.

Reminder: A Y- connected load consists of three impedances connected to a neutral node, while a  $\Delta$ - connected load consists of three impedances connected around a loop. The load is balanced when the three impedances are equal in either case.

A balanced load is one in which the phase impedances are equal in magnitude and in phase.

For a balanced wye- connected load,

$$
\mathbf{Z}_1 = \mathbf{Z}_2 = \mathbf{Z}_3 = \mathbf{Z}_Y \tag{12.6}
$$

where  $\mathbf{Z}_Y$  is the load impedance per phase. For a balanced delta- connected load,

$$
\mathbf{Z}_a = \mathbf{Z}_b = \mathbf{Z}_c = \mathbf{Z}_\Lambda \tag{12.7}
$$

where  $\mathbf{Z}_\Delta$  is the load impedance per phase in this case. We recall from Eq. (9.69) that

\mathbf{Z}_\Delta = 3\mathbf{Z}_Y \qquad \text{or} \qquad \mathbf{Z}_Y = \frac{1}{3}\mathbf{Z}_\Delta \tag{12.8}
$$

so we know that a wye- connected load can be transformed into a delta- connected load, or vice versa, using Eq. (12.8).

Because both the three- phase source and the three- phase load can be either wye- or delta- connected, we have four possible connections:

- Y-Y connection (i.e., Y-connected source with a Y-connected load).- Y- $\Delta$  connection.-  $\Delta$ - $\Delta$  connection.-  $\Delta$ -Y connection.

In subsequent sections, we will consider each of these possible configurations.

It is appropriate to mention here that a balanced delta- connected load is more common than a balanced wye- connected load. This is due to the ease with which loads may be added or removed from each phase of a delta- connected load. This is very difficult with a wye- connected load because the neutral may not be accessible. On the other hand, delta- connected sources are not common in practice because of the circulating current that will result in the delta- mesh if the three- phase voltages are slightly unbalanced.

# Example 12.1

Determine the phase sequence of the set of voltages

$$
\nu_{an} = 200\cos (\omega t + 10^{\circ})
$$

$$
\nu_{bn} = 200\cos (\omega t - 230^{\circ}), \qquad \nu_{cn} = 200\cos (\omega t - 110^{\circ})
$$

# Solution:

The voltages can be expressed in phasor form as

$$
\mathbf{V}_{an} = 200\big / 10^{\circ}\mathrm{~V},\qquad \mathbf{V}_{bn} = 200\big / - 230^{\circ}\mathrm{~V},\qquad \mathbf{V}_{cn} = 200\big / - 110^{\circ}\mathrm{~V}
$$

We notice that  $\mathbf{V}_{an}$  leads  $\mathbf{V}_{cn}$  by  $120^{\circ}$  and  $\mathbf{V}_{cn}$  in turn leads  $\mathbf{V}_{bn}$  by  $120^{\circ}$ . Hence, we have an  $acb$  sequence.

Given that  $\mathbf{V}_{bn} = 110\big / 30^{\circ}\mathrm{~V}$ , find  $\mathbf{V}_{an}$  and  $\mathbf{V}_{cn}$ , assuming a positive  $(abc)$  sequence.

Answer:  $110\big / 150^{\circ}\mathrm{~V}$ ,  $110\big / - 90^{\circ}\mathrm{~V}$ .

# 12.3 Balanced Wye-Wye Connection

We begin with the Y- Y system, because any balanced three- phase system can be reduced to an equivalent Y- Y system. Therefore, analysis of this system should be regarded as the key to solving all balanced three- phase systems.

A balanced Y- Y system is a three- phase system with a balanced Y- connected source and a balanced Y- connected load.

Consider the balanced four- wire Y- Y system of Fig. 12.9, where a Y- connected load is connected to a Y- connected source. We assume a balanced load so that load impedances are equal. Although the impedance  $\mathbf{Z}_{Y}$  is the total load impedance per phase, it may also be regarded as the sum of the source impedance  $\mathbf{Z}_{s}$ , line impedance  $\mathbf{Z}_{\ell}$ , and load impedance  $\mathbf{Z}_{L}$  for each phase, since these impedances are in series. As illustrated in Fig. 12.9,  $\mathbf{Z}_{s}$  denotes the internal impedance of the phase winding of the generator;  $\mathbf{Z}_{\ell}$  is the impedance of the line joining a phase of the source with a phase of the load;  $\mathbf{Z}_{L}$  is the impedance of each phase of the load; and  $\mathbf{Z}_{n}$  is the impedance of the neutral line. Thus, in general

$$
\mathbf{Z}_{Y} = \mathbf{Z}_{s} + \mathbf{Z}_{\ell} + \mathbf{Z}_{L} \tag{12.9}
$$

Figure 12.9 A balanced Y-Y system, showing the source, line, and load impedances.

$\mathbf{Z}_{s}$  and  $\mathbf{Z}_{\ell}$  are often very small compared with  $\mathbf{Z}_{L}$ , so one can assume that  $\mathbf{Z}_{Y} = \mathbf{Z}_{L}$  if no source or line impedance is given. In any event, by lumping the impedances together, the Y- Y system in Fig. 12.9 can be simplified to that shown in Fig. 12.10.

Assuming the positive sequence, the phase voltages (or line- to- neutral voltages) are

$$
\begin{array}{r}\mathbf{V}_{an} = V_p / 0^\circ \\ \mathbf{V}_{bn} = V_p / - 120^\circ ,\qquad \mathbf{V}_{cn} = V_p / + 120^\circ \end{array} \tag{12.10}
$$

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-14/63c420e9-9220-47ad-935a-09e6b2aeb2a8/b0b1776dd1e26491b958aea28bd2a28ae33f53308963fcf5b1993ca77b44a4c6.jpg)  
Figure 12.10 Balanced Y-Y connection.

The line- to- line voltages or simply line voltages  $\mathbf{V}_{ab}$ ,  $\mathbf{V}_{bc}$ , and  $\mathbf{V}_{ca}$  are related to the phase voltages. For example,

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{\bf V}_{a b} = {\bf V}_{a n} + {\bf V}_{n b} = {\bf V}_{a n} - {\bf V}_{b n} = V_{p}\big / 0^{\circ} - V_{p}\big / - 120^{\circ}}\\ {= V_{p}\bigg(1 + \frac{1}{2} +j\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\bigg) = \sqrt{3} V_{p}\big / 30^{\circ}} \end{array} \tag{12.11a}
$$

Similarly, we can obtain

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{\bf V}_{b c} = {\bf V}_{b n} - {\bf V}_{c n} = \sqrt{3} V_{p}\big / - 90^{\circ}}\\ {{\bf V}_{c a} = {\bf V}_{c n} - {\bf V}_{a n} = \sqrt{3} V_{p}\big / - 210^{\circ}}} \end{array} \tag{12.11b}
$$

Thus, the magnitude of the line voltages  $V_{L}$  is  $\sqrt{3}$  times the magnitude of the phase voltages  $V_{p}$ , or

$$
V_{L} = \sqrt{3} V_{p} \tag{12.12}
$$

where

$$
V_{p} = |\mathbf{V}_{an}| = |\mathbf{V}_{bn}| = |\mathbf{V}_{cn}| \tag{12.13}
$$

and

$$
V_{L} = |\mathbf{V}_{ab}| = |\mathbf{V}_{bc}| = |\mathbf{V}_{ca}| \tag{12.14}
$$

Also the line voltages lead their corresponding phase voltages by  $30^{\circ}$ . Figure 12.11(a) illustrates this. Figure 12.11(a) also shows how to determine  $\mathbf{V}_{ab}$  from the phase voltages, while Fig. 12.11(b) shows the same for the three line voltages. Notice that  $\mathbf{V}_{ab}$  leads  $\mathbf{V}_{bc}$  by  $120^{\circ}$ , and  $\mathbf{V}_{bc}$  leads  $\mathbf{V}_{ca}$  by  $120^{\circ}$ , so that the line voltages sum up to zero as do the phase voltages.

Applying KVL to each phase in Fig. 12.10, we obtain the line currents as

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{{\bf I}_{a}=\frac{{\bf V}_{a n}}{{\bf Z}_{Y}}\qquad{\bf I}_{b}=\frac{{\bf V}_{b n}}{{\bf Z}_{Y}}=\frac{{\bf V}_{a n}/-120^{\circ}}{{\bf Z}_{Y}}={\bf I}_{a}/-120^{\circ}}}\\ {{{\bf I}_{c}=\frac{{\bf V}_{c n}}{{\bf Z}_{Y}}=\frac{{\bf V}_{a n}/-240^{\circ}}{{\bf Z}_{Y}}={\bf I}_{a}/-240^{\circ}}}\end{array} \tag{12.15}
$$

We can readily infer that the line currents add up to zero,

$$
\mathbf{I}_{a} + \mathbf{I}_{b} + \mathbf{I}_{c} = 0 \tag{12.16}
$$

so that

$$
\mathbf{I}_{n} = -(\mathbf{I}_{a} + \mathbf{I}_{b} + \mathbf{I}_{c}) = 0 \tag{12.17a}
$$

or

$$
\mathbf{V}_{nN} = \mathbf{Z}_{n}\mathbf{I}_{n} = 0 \tag{12.17b}
$$

that is, the voltage across the neutral wire is zero. The neutral line can thus be removed without affecting the system. In fact, in long distance power transmission, conductors in multiples of three are used with the earth itself acting as the neutral conductor. Power systems designed in this way are well grounded at all critical points to ensure safety.

While the line current is the current in each line, the phase current is the current in each phase of the source or load. In the Y- Y system, the line current is the same as the phase current. We will use single subscripts

for line currents because it is natural and conventional to assume that line currents flow from the source to the load.

An alternative way of analyzing a balanced Y- Y system is to do so on a "per phase" basis. We look at one phase, say phase  $a$ , and analyze the single- phase equivalent circuit in Fig. 12.12. The single- phase analysis yields the line current  $\mathbf{I}_{a}$  as

$$
\mathbf{I}_{a} = \frac{\mathbf{V}_{an}}{\mathbf{Z}_{Y}}
$$

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-14/63c420e9-9220-47ad-935a-09e6b2aeb2a8/e6913219f51c0230e981db05124f90d78951ec1d20ac2aeed9feeb982fc46c52.jpg)  
Figure 12.12 A single-phase equivalent circuit.

From  $\mathbf{I}_{a}$ , we use the phase sequence to obtain other line currents. Thus, as long as the system is balanced, we need only analyze one phase. We may do this even if the neutral line is absent, as in the three- wire system.

Calculate the line currents in the three- wire Y- Y system of Fig. 12.13.

Figure 12.13 Three-wire Y-Y system; for Example 12.2.

# Solution:

The three- phase circuit in Fig. 12.13 is balanced; we may replace it with its single- phase equivalent circuit such as in Fig. 12.12. We obtain  $\mathbf{I}_{a}$  from the single- phase analysis as

$$
\mathbf{I}_{a} = \frac{\mathbf{V}_{an}}{\mathbf{Z}_{Y}}
$$

where  $\mathbf{Z}_{Y} = (5 - j2) + (10 + j8) = 15 + j6 = 16.155 / 21.8^{\circ}$ . Hence,

$$
\mathbf{I}_{a} = \frac{110 / 0^{\circ}}{16.155 / 21.8^{\circ}} = 6.81 / - 21.8^{\circ}\mathrm{~A~}
$$

In as much as the source voltages in Fig. 12.13 are in positive sequence, the line currents are also in positive sequence:

$$
\mathbf{I}_{c} = \mathbf{I}_{a} / - 240^{\circ} = 6.81 / - 261.8^{\circ}\mathrm{~A~} = 6.81 / 98.2^{\circ}\mathrm{~A~}
$$

# Practice Problem 12.2

A Y- connected balanced three- phase generator with an impedance of  $0.4 + j0.3\Omega$  per phase is connected to a Y- connected balanced load with an impedance of  $24 + j19\Omega$  per phase. The line joining the generator and the load has an impedance of  $0.6 + j0.7\Omega$  per phase. Assuming a positive sequence for the source voltages and that  $\mathbf{V}_{an} = 120 / 30^{\circ}\mathrm{~V~}$  find: (a) the line voltages, (b) the line currents.

Answer: (a)  $207.8 / 60^{\circ}\mathrm{~V~}$ $207.8 / - 60^{\circ}\mathrm{~V~}$ $207.8 / - 180^{\circ}\mathrm{~V~}$  (b)  $3.75 / - 8.66^{\circ}\mathrm{~A~}$ $3.75 / - 128.66^{\circ}\mathrm{~A~}$ $3.75 / 111.34^{\circ}\mathrm{~A~}$

# 12.4 Balanced Wye-Delta Connection

A balanced Y- A system consists of a balanced Y- connected source feeding a balanced  $\Delta$  - connected load.

This is perhaps the most practical three- phase system, as the threephase sources are usually Y- connected while the three- phase loads are usually  $\Delta$  - connected.

The balanced Y- delta system is shown in Fig. 12.14, where the source is Y- connected and the load is  $\Delta$  - connected. There is, of course, no neutral connection from source to load for this case. Assuming the positive sequence, the phase voltages are again

$$
\begin{array}{r}{\mathbf{V}_{a n} = V_{p} / 0^{\circ}}\\ {\mathbf{V}_{b n} = V_{p} / - 120^{\circ},\qquad \mathbf{V}_{c n} = V_{p} / + 120^{\circ}} \end{array} \tag{12.19}
$$

As shown in Section 12.3, the line voltages are

$$
\begin{array}{r}{\mathbf{V}_{a b} = \sqrt{3} V_{p} / 30^{\circ} = \mathbf{V}_{A B},\qquad \mathbf{V}_{b c} = \sqrt{3} V_{p} / - 90^{\circ} = \mathbf{V}_{B C}}\\ {\mathbf{V}_{c a} = \sqrt{3} V_{p} / 150^{\circ} = \mathbf{V}_{C A}} \end{array} \tag{12.20}
$$

showing that the line voltages are equal to the voltages across the load impedances for this system configuration. From these voltages, we can obtain the phase currents as

$$
\mathbf{I}_{A B} = \frac{\mathbf{V}_{A B}}{\mathbf{Z}_{\Delta}},\qquad \mathbf{I}_{B C} = \frac{\mathbf{V}_{B C}}{\mathbf{Z}_{\Delta}},\qquad \mathbf{I}_{C A} = \frac{\mathbf{V}_{C A}}{\mathbf{Z}_{\Delta}} \tag{12.21}
$$

These currents have the same magnitude but are out of phase with each other by  $120^{\circ}$

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-14/63c420e9-9220-47ad-935a-09e6b2aeb2a8/97c78e01c612ae061769ce91a74e53343e21fbb77ab1595fe5f735e0f854a06b.jpg)  
Figure 12.14 Balanced Y-  $\Delta$  connection.

Another way to get these phase currents is to apply KVL. For example, applying KVL around loop  $aABbna$  gives

$$
-\mathbf{V}_{an} + \mathbf{Z}_{\Delta}\mathbf{I}_{AB} + \mathbf{V}_{bn} = 0
$$

or

$$
\mathbf{I}_{AB} = \frac{\mathbf{V}_{an} - \mathbf{V}_{bn}}{\mathbf{Z}_{\Delta}} = \frac{\mathbf{V}_{ab}}{\mathbf{Z}_{\Delta}} = \frac{\mathbf{V}_{AB}}{\mathbf{Z}_{\Delta}} \tag{12.22}
$$

which is the same as Eq. (12.21). This is the more general way of finding the phase currents.

The line currents are obtained from the phase currents by applying KCL at nodes  $A$ ,  $B$ , and  $C$ . Thus,

$$
\mathbf{I}_{a} = \mathbf{I}_{AB} - \mathbf{I}_{CA},\qquad \mathbf{I}_{b} = \mathbf{I}_{BC} - \mathbf{I}_{AB},\qquad \mathbf{I}_{c} = \mathbf{I}_{CA} - \mathbf{I}_{BC} \tag{12.23}
$$

Since  $\mathbf{I}_{CA} = \mathbf{I}_{AB} / - 240^{\circ}$

$$
\begin{array}{r l} & {\mathbf{I}_{a} = \mathbf{I}_{A B} - \mathbf{I}_{C A} = \mathbf{I}_{A B}(1 - 1 / - 240^{\circ})}\\ & {\qquad = \mathbf{I}_{A B}(1 + 0.5 - j0.866) = \mathbf{I}_{A B}\sqrt{3} / - 30^{\circ}} \end{array} \tag{12.24}
$$

showing that the magnitude  $I_{L}$  of the line current is  $\sqrt{3}$  times the magnitude  $I_{p}$  of the phase current, or

$$
I^{L} = \sqrt{3} I_{P} \tag{12.25}
$$

where

$$
I_{L} = |\mathbf{I}_{a}| = |\mathbf{I}_{b}| = |\mathbf{I}_{c}| \tag{12.26}
$$

and

$$
I_{p} = |\mathbf{I}_{AB}| = |\mathbf{I}_{BC}| = |\mathbf{I}_{CA}| \tag{12.27}
$$

Also, the line currents lag the corresponding phase currents by  $30^{\circ}$ , assuming the positive sequence. Figure 12.15 is a phasor diagram illustrating the relationship between the phase and line currents.

An alternative way of analyzing the  $\mathrm{Y} - \Delta$  circuit is to transform the  $\Delta$ - connected load to an equivalent  $\mathrm{Y}$ - connected load. Using the  $\Delta$ -  $\mathrm{Y}$  transformation formula in Eq. (12.8),

$$
\mathbf{Z}_{Y} = \frac{\mathbf{Z}_{\Delta}}{3} \tag{12.28}
$$

After this transformation, we now have a  $\mathrm{Y} - \mathrm{Y}$  system as in Fig. 12.10. The three- phase  $\mathrm{Y} - \Delta$  system in Fig. 12.14 can be replaced by the single- phase equivalent circuit in Fig. 12.16. This allows us to calculate only the line currents. The phase currents are obtained using Eq. (12.25) and utilizing the fact that each of the phase currents leads the corresponding line current by  $30^{\circ}$ .

Figure 12.16 A single-phase equivalent circuit of a balanced  $\mathrm{Y} - \Delta$  circuit.

A balanced  $abc$ - sequence  $\mathrm{Y}$ - connected source with  $\mathbf{V}_{an} = 100 / 10^{\circ}\mathrm{V}$  is connected to a  $\Delta$ - connected balanced load  $(8 + j4)\Omega$  per phase. Calculate the phase and line currents.

# Solution:

This can be solved in two ways.

METHOD 1 The load impedance is

$$
\mathbf{Z}_{\Delta} = 8 + j4 = 8.944\underline{{26.57^{\circ}}}\Omega
$$

If the phase voltage  $\mathbf{V}_{an} = 100\underline{{/10^{\circ}}}$  , then the line voltage is

$$
\mathbf{V}_{ab} = \mathbf{V}_{an}\sqrt{3}\underline{{/30^{\circ}}} = 100\sqrt{3}\underline{{/10^{\circ}}} +30^{\circ} = \mathbf{V}_{AB}
$$

or

$$
\mathbf{V}_{AB} = 173.2\underline{{/40^{\circ}}}\mathrm{~V~}
$$

The phase currents are

$$
\mathbf{I}_{AB} = \frac{\mathbf{V}_{AB}}{\mathbf{Z}_{\Delta}} = \frac{173.2\underline{{/40^{\circ}}}}{8.944\underline{{/26.57^{\circ}}}} = 19.36\underline{{/13.43^{\circ}}}\mathrm{~A~}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{r}{\mathbf{I}_{BC} = \mathbf{I}_{AB}\underline{{/ - 120^{\circ}}} = 19.36\underline{{/ - 106.57^{\circ}}}\mathrm{~A~}}\\ {\mathbf{I}_{CA} = \mathbf{I}_{AB}\underline{{/ + 120^{\circ}}} = 19.36\underline{{/133.43^{\circ}}}\mathrm{~A~}} \end{array}
$$

The line currents are

$$
\begin{array}{r}{\mathbf{I}_{a} = \mathbf{I}_{AB}\sqrt{3}\underline{{/ - 30^{\circ}}} = \sqrt{3}(19.36)\underline{{/13.43^{\circ}}} -30^{\circ}}\\ {= 33.53\underline{{/ - 16.57^{\circ}}}\mathrm{~A~}}\\ {\mathbf{I}_{b} = \mathbf{I}_{a}\underline{{/ - 120^{\circ}}} = 33.53\underline{{/ - 136.57^{\circ}}}\mathrm{~A~}}\\ {\mathbf{I}_{c} = \mathbf{I}_{a}\underline{{/ + 120^{\circ}}} = 33.53\underline{{/103.43^{\circ}}}\mathrm{~A~}} \end{array}
$$

METHOD 2 Alternatively, using single- phase analysis,

$$
\mathbf{I}_{a} = \frac{\mathbf{V}_{an}}{\mathbf{Z}_{\Delta} / 3} = \frac{100\underline{{/10^{\circ}}}}{2.981\underline{{/26.57^{\circ}}}} = 33.54\underline{{/ - 16.57^{\circ}}}\mathrm{~A~}
$$

as above. Other line currents are obtained using the abc phase sequence.

# Practice Problem 12.3

One line voltage of a balanced Y- connected source is  $\mathbf{V}_{AB} = 120\underline{{/ - 20^{\circ}}}\mathrm{~V~}$  If the source is connected to a  $\Delta$  - connected load of  $20 / 40^{\circ}\Omega$  , find the phase and line currents. Assume the abc sequence.

Answer:  $6\underline{{/ - 60^{\circ}}}$  A,  $6\underline{{/ - 180^{\circ}}}$  A,  $6\underline{{/60^{\circ}}}$  A, 10.392/- 90° A, 10.392/150° A, 10.392/30° A.

# 12.5 Balanced Delta-Delta Connection

A balanced  $\Delta - \Delta$  system is one in which both the balanced source and balanced load are  $\Delta$  - connected.

The source as well as the load may be delta- connected as shown in Fig. 12.17. Our goal is to obtain the phase and line currents as usual.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-14/63c420e9-9220-47ad-935a-09e6b2aeb2a8/4f894e7dd79b74d8470b2865d5f80e97945873ef0fcc02a40c049480ee2a5b00.jpg)  
Figure 12.17 A balanced  $\Delta -\Delta$  connection.

Assuming a positive sequence, the phase voltages for a delta- connected source are

$$
\mathbf{V}_{ab} = V_{p} / 0^{\circ} \tag{12.29}
$$

The line voltages are the same as the phase voltages. From Fig. 12.17, assuming there is no line impedances, the phase voltages of the delta- connected source are equal to the voltages across the impedances; that is,

$$
\mathbf{V}_{ab} = \mathbf{V}_{AB}, \qquad \mathbf{V}_{bc} = \mathbf{V}_{BC}, \qquad \mathbf{V}_{ca} = \mathbf{V}_{CA} \tag{12.30}
$$

Hence, the phase currents are

$$
\mathbf{I}_{AB} = \frac{\mathbf{V}_{AB}}{Z_{\Delta}} = \frac{\mathbf{V}_{ab}}{Z_{\Delta}}, \qquad \mathbf{I}_{BC} = \frac{\mathbf{V}_{BC}}{Z_{\Delta}} = \frac{\mathbf{V}_{bc}}{Z_{\Delta}} \tag{12.31}
$$

Because the load is delta- connected just as in the previous section, some of the formulas derived there apply here. The line currents are obtained from the phase currents by applying KCL at nodes  $A$ ,  $B$ , and  $C$ , as we did in the previous section:

$$
\mathbf{I}_{a} = \mathbf{I}_{AB} - \mathbf{I}_{CA}, \qquad \mathbf{I}_{b} = \mathbf{I}_{BC} - \mathbf{I}_{AB}, \qquad \mathbf{I}_{c} = \mathbf{I}_{CA} - \mathbf{I}_{BC} \tag{12.32}
$$

Also, as shown in the last section, each line current lags the corresponding phase current by  $30^{\circ}$  ; the magnitude  $I_{L}$  of the line current is  $\sqrt{3}$  times the magnitude  $I_{p}$  of the phase current,

$$
I_{L} = \sqrt{3} I_{p} \tag{12.33}
$$

An alternative way of analyzing the  $\Delta - \Delta$  circuit is to convert both the source and the load to their  $\mathbf{Y}$  equivalents. We already know that  $\mathbf{Z}_{Y} = \mathbf{Z}_{\Delta} / 3$ . To convert a  $\Delta$ - connected source to a  $\mathbf{Y}$ - connected source, see the next section.

# Solution:

The load impedance per phase is

$$
\mathbf{Z}_{\Delta} = 20 - j15 = 25\underline{{-36.57^{\circ}}}\Omega
$$

Since  $\mathbf{V}_{AB} = \mathbf{V}_{ab}$ , the phase currents are

$$
\begin{array}{r}\mathbf{I}_{AB} = \frac{\mathbf{V}_{AB}}{\mathbf{Z}_{\Delta}} = \frac{330\sqrt{0^{\circ}}}{25\underline{{-36.87^{\circ}}}} = 13.2\underline{{36.87^{\circ}}}\mathrm{A}\\ \mathbf{I}_{BC} = \mathbf{I}_{AB} / - 120^{\circ} = 13.2\underline{{-83.13^{\circ}}}\mathrm{A}\\ \mathbf{I}_{CA} = \mathbf{I}_{AB} / + 120^{\circ} = 13.2\underline{{156.87^{\circ}}}\mathrm{A} \end{array}
$$

For a delta load, the line current always lags the corresponding phase current by  $30^{\circ}$  and has a magnitude  $\sqrt{3}$  times that of the phase current. Hence, the line currents are

$$
\begin{array}{r l} & {\mathbf{I}_{a} = \mathbf{I}_{A B}\sqrt{3}\big / - 30^{\circ} = (13.2\big / 36.87^{\circ})(\sqrt{3}\big / - 30^{\circ})}\\ & {\qquad = 22.86\big / 6.87^{\circ}\mathrm{~A~}}\\ & {\qquad \mathbf{I}_{b} = \mathbf{I}_{a}\big / - 120^{\circ} = 22.86\big / - 113.13^{\circ}\mathrm{~A~}}\\ & {\qquad \mathbf{I}_{c} = \mathbf{I}_{a}\big / + 120^{\circ} = 22.86\big / 126.87^{\circ}\mathrm{~A~}} \end{array}
$$

# Practice Problem 12.4

A positive- sequence, balanced  $\Delta$ - connected source supplies a balanced  $\Delta$ - connected load. If the impedance per phase of the load is  $18 + j12\Omega$  and  $\mathbf{I}_{a} = 9.609\underline{35^{\circ}}$  A, find  $\mathbf{I}_{AB}$  and  $\mathbf{V}_{AB}$ .

Answer:  $5.548\underline{65^{\circ}}$  A,  $120 / 98.69^{\circ}$  V.

# 12.6 Balanced Delta-Wye Connection

A balanced  $\Delta$ - Y system consists of a balanced  $\Delta$ - connected source feeding a balanced Y- connected load.

Consider the  $\Delta$ - Y circuit in Fig. 12.18. Again, assuming the abc sequence, the phase voltages of a delta- connected source are

$$
\begin{array}{r}\mathbf{V}_{ab} = V_p\underline{0^\circ},\qquad \mathbf{V}_{bc} = V_p\underline{-120^\circ}\\ \mathbf{V}_{ca} = V_p\underline{+120^\circ} \end{array} \tag{12.34}
$$

These are also the line voltages as well as the phase voltages.

We can obtain the line currents in many ways. One way is to apply KVL to loop  $aAB / Bba$  in Fig. 12.18, writing

$$
-\mathbf{V}_{ab} + \mathbf{Z}_{Y}\mathbf{I}_{a} - \mathbf{Z}_{Y}\mathbf{I}_{b} = 0
$$

or

$$
\mathbf{Z}_{Y}(\mathbf{I}_{a} - \mathbf{I}_{b}) = \mathbf{V}_{ab} = V_{p}\underline{0^{\circ}}
$$

Thus,

$$
\mathbf{I}_{a} - \mathbf{I}_{b} = \frac{V_{p} / 0^{\circ}}{\mathbf{Z}_{Y}} \tag{12.35}
$$

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-14/63c420e9-9220-47ad-935a-09e6b2aeb2a8/0d4a2b48a653388c31a709d395950621111181b11ac88566b72f6885af2ad6d0.jpg)  
Figure 12.18 A balanced  $\Delta -Y$  connection.

But  $\mathbf{I}_b$  lags  $\mathbf{I}_a$  by  $120^{\circ}$ , since we assumed the abc sequence; that is,  $\mathbf{I}_b = \mathbf{I}_a / - 120^{\circ}$ . Hence,

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{\bf I}_{a}-{\bf I}_{b}={\bf I}_{a}(1-1/-120^{\circ})}\\ {={\bf I}_{a}\Big(1+\frac{1}{2}+\frac{j\sqrt{3}}{2}\Big)={\bf I}_{a}\sqrt{3}/30^{\circ}}\end{array} \tag{12.36}
$$

Substituting Eq. (12.36) into Eq. (12.35) gives

$$
\mathbf{I}_a = \frac{V_p / \sqrt{3} / - 30^\circ}{\mathbf{Z}_Y} \tag{12.37}
$$

From this, we obtain the other line currents  $\mathbf{I}_b$  and  $\mathbf{I}_c$  using the positive phase sequence, i.e.,  $\mathbf{I}_b = \mathbf{I}_a / - 120^\circ$ ,  $\mathbf{I}_c = \mathbf{I}_a / + 120^\circ$ . The phase currents are equal to the line currents.

Another way to obtain the line currents is to replace the delta- connected source with its equivalent wye- connected source, as shown in Fig. 12.19. In Section 12.3, we found that the line- to- line voltages of a wye- connected source lead their corresponding phase voltages by  $30^{\circ}$ . Therefore, we obtain each phase voltage of the equivalent wye- connected source by dividing the corresponding line voltage of the delta- connected source by  $\sqrt{3}$  and shifting its phase by  $- 30^{\circ}$ . Thus, the equivalent wye- connected source has the phase voltages

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{\bf V}_{a n} = \frac{V_{p}}{\sqrt{3}} / - 30^{\circ}}\\ {{\bf V}_{b n} = \frac{V_{p}}{\sqrt{3}} / - 150^{\circ},\qquad {\bf V}_{c n} = \frac{V_{p}}{\sqrt{3}} / + 90^{\circ}} \end{array} \tag{12.38}
$$

If the delta- connected source has source impedance  $\mathbf{Z}_s$  per phase, the equivalent wye- connected source will have a source impedance of  $\mathbf{Z}_s / 3$  per phase, according to Eq. (9.69).

Once the source is transformed to wye, the circuit becomes a wye- wye system. Therefore, we can use the equivalent single- phase circuit shown in Fig. 12.20, from which the line current for phase  $a$  is

$$
\mathbf{I}_a = \frac{V_p / \sqrt{3} / - 30^\circ}{\mathbf{Z}_Y} \tag{12.39}
$$

which is the same as Eq. (12.37).

Alternatively, we may transform the wye- connected load to an equivalent delta- connected load. This results in a delta- delta system, which can be analyzed as in Section 12.5. Note that

$$
\begin{array}{c}{\mathbf{V}_{AN} = \mathbf{I}_a\mathbf{Z}_Y = \frac{V_p}{\sqrt{3}}\big / - 30^\circ}\\ {\mathbf{V}_{BN} = \mathbf{V}_{AN}\big / - 120^\circ ,\qquad \mathbf{V}_{CN} = \mathbf{V}_{AN}\big / + 120^\circ} \end{array} \tag{12.40}
$$

As stated earlier, the delta- connected load is more desirable than the wye- connected load. It is easier to alter the loads in any one phase of the delta- connected loads, as the individual loads are connected directly across the lines. However, the delta- connected source is hardly used in practice because any slight imbalance in the phase voltages will result in unwanted circulating currents.

Table 12.1 presents a summary of the formulas for phase currents and voltages and line currents and voltages for the four connections. Students are advised not to memorize the formulas but to understand

how they are derived. The formulas can always be obtained by directly applying KCL and KVL to the appropriate three- phase circuits.

A balanced Y- connected load with a phase impedance of  $40 + j25\Omega$  is supplied by a balanced, positive sequence  $\Delta$ - connected source with a line voltage of  $210\mathrm{V}$ . Calculate the phase currents. Use  $\mathbf{V}_{ab}$  as a reference.

# Solution:

The load impedance is

$$
\mathbf{Z}_{Y} = 40 + j25 = 47.17\underline{32^{\circ}}\Omega
$$

and the source voltage is

$$
\mathbf{V}_{ab} = 210\underline{0^{\circ}}\mathbf{V}
$$

When the  $\Delta$ - connected source is transformed to a Y- connected source,

$$
\mathbf{V}_{an} = \frac{\mathbf{V}_{ab}}{\sqrt{3}}\underline{/ - 30^{\circ}} = 121.2\underline{/ - 30^{\circ}}\mathbf{V}
$$

The line currents are

$$
\mathbf{I}_{a} = \frac{\mathbf{V}_{an}}{\mathbf{Z}_{Y}} = \frac{121.2\underline{/ - 30^{\circ}}}{47.12\underline{/32^{\circ}}} = 2.57\underline{/ - 62^{\circ}}\mathrm{~A~}
$$

$$
\mathbf{I}_{b} = \mathbf{I}_{a} / - 120^{\circ} = 2.57\underline{/ - 178^{\circ}}\mathrm{~A~}
$$

$$
\mathbf{I}_{c} = \mathbf{I}_{a} / 120^{\circ} = 2.57\underline{/58^{\circ}}\mathrm{~A~}
$$

which are the same as the phase currents.

In a balanced  $\Delta$ - Y circuit,  $\mathbf{V}_{ab} = 240\underline{/15^{\circ}}$  and  $\mathbf{Z}_{Y} = (12 + j15)\Omega$ . Practice Problem 12.5 Calculate the line currents.

Answer:  $7.21\underline{/ - 66.34^{\circ}}\mathrm{~A},7.21\underline{/ + 173.66^{\circ}}\mathrm{~A},7.21\underline{/53.66^{\circ}}\mathrm{~A}$ .

# 12.7 Power in a Balanced System

Let us now consider the power in a balanced three- phase system. We begin by examining the instantaneous power absorbed by the load. This requires that the analysis be done in the time domain. For a Y- connected load, the phase voltages are

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{\nu_{A N}=\sqrt{2}V_{p}\cos\omega t,\qquad\nu_{B N}=\sqrt{2}V_{p}\cos(\omega t-120^{\circ})}}\\ {{\nu_{C N}=\sqrt{2}V_{p}\cos(\omega t+120^{\circ})}}\end{array} \tag{12.41}
$$

where the factor  $\sqrt{2}$  is necessary because  $V_{p}$  has been defined as the rms value of the phase voltage. If  $\mathbf{Z}_{Y} = \mathbf{Z} / \theta$ , the phase currents lag behind their corresponding phase voltages by  $\theta$ . Thus,

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{i_{a}=\sqrt{2}I_{p}\cos(\omega t-\theta),\qquad i_{b}=\sqrt{2}I_{p}\cos(\omega t-\theta-120^{\circ})}}\\ {{i_{c}=\sqrt{2}I_{p}\cos(\omega t-\theta+120^{\circ})}}\end{array} \tag{12.42}
$$

where  $I_{p}$  is the rms value of the phase current. The total instantaneous power in the load is the sum of the instantaneous powers in the three phases; that is,

$$
\begin{array}{r l} & {p = p_{a} + p_{b} + p_{c} = \nu_{A}n_{a}^{i} + \nu_{B N}i_{b} + \nu_{C N}i_{c}}\\ & {\quad = 2V_{p}I_{p}[\cos \omega t\cos (\omega t - \theta)}\\ & {\qquad +\cos (\omega t - 120^{\circ})\cos (\omega t - \theta -120^{\circ})}\\ & {\qquad +\cos (\omega t + 120^{\circ})\cos (\omega t - \theta +120^{\circ})]} \end{array} \tag{12.43}
$$

Applying the trigonometric identity

$$
\cos A\cos B = \frac{1}{2} [\cos (A + B) + \cos (A - B)] \tag{12.44}
$$

gives

$$
\begin{array}{r l} & {p = V_{p}I_{p}[3\cos \theta +\cos (2\omega t - \theta) + \cos (2\omega t - \theta -240^{\circ})}\\ & {\qquad +\cos (2\omega t - \theta +240^{\circ})]}\\ & {= V_{p}I_{p}[3\cos \theta +\cos \alpha +\cos \alpha \cos 240^{\circ} + \sin \alpha \sin 240^{\circ}}\\ & {\qquad +\cos \alpha \cos 240^{\circ} - \sin \alpha \sin 240^{\circ}]}\\ & {\qquad \mathrm{where} \alpha = 2\omega t - \theta}\\ & {= V_{p}I_{p}\Big[3\cos \theta +\cos \alpha +2\Big(-\frac{1}{2}\Big)\cos \alpha \Big] = 3V_{p}I_{p}\cos \theta} \end{array} \tag{12.45}
$$

Thus the total instantaneous power in a balanced three- phase system is constant—it does not change with time as the instantaneous power of each phase does. This result is true whether the load is Y- or  $\Delta$ - connected. This is one important reason for using a three- phase system to generate and distribute power. We will look into another reason a little later.

Since the total instantaneous power is independent of time, the average power per phase  $P_{p}$  for either the  $\Delta$ - connected load or the Y- connected load is  $p / 3$ , or

$$
P_{p} = V_{p}I_{p}\cos \theta \tag{12.46}
$$

and the reactive power per phase is

$$
Q_{p} = V_{p}I_{p}\sin \theta \tag{12.47}
$$

The apparent power per phase is

$$
S_{p} = V_{p}I_{p} \tag{12.48}
$$

The complex power per phase is

$$
\mathbf{S}_{p} = P_{p} + jQ_{p} = \mathbf{V}_{p}\mathbf{I}_{p}^{*} \tag{12.49}
$$

where  $\mathbf{V}_{p}$  and  $\mathbf{I}_{p}$  are the phase voltage and phase current with magnitudes  $V_{p}$  and  $I_{p}$ , respectively. The total average power is the sum of the average powers in the phases:

$$
P = P_{a} + P_{b} + P_{c} = 3P_{p} = 3V_{p}I_{p}\cos \theta = \sqrt{3} V_{L}I_{L}\cos \theta \tag{12.50}
$$

For a Y- connected load,  $I_{L} = I_{p}$  but  $V_{L} = \sqrt{3} V_{p}$ , whereas for a  $\Delta$ - connected load,  $I_{L} = \sqrt{3} I_{p}$  but  $V_{L} = V_{p}$ . Thus, Eq. (12.50) applies for both Y- connected and  $\Delta$ - connected loads. Similarly, the total reactive power is

$$
Q = 3V_{p}I_{p}\sin \theta = 3Q_{p} = \sqrt{3} V_{L}I_{L}\sin \theta \tag{12.51}
$$

and the total complex power is

$$
\boxed{\mathbf{S} = 3\mathbf{S}_{p} = 3\mathbf{V}_{p}\mathbf{I}_{p}^{*} = 3I_{p}^{2}\mathbf{Z}_{p} = \frac{3V_{p}^{2}}{\mathbf{Z}_{p}^{*}}} \tag{12.52}
$$

where  $\mathbf{Z}_{p} = Z_{p} / \theta$  is the load impedance per phase. ( $\mathbf{Z}_{p}$  could be  $\mathbf{Z}_{Y}$  or  $\mathbf{Z}_{\Delta}$ .) Alternatively, we may write Eq. (12.52) as

$$
\boxed{\mathbf{S} = P + jQ = \sqrt{3} V_{L}I_{L} / \theta} \tag{12.53}
$$

Remember that  $V_{p}, I_{p}, V_{L}$ , and  $I_{L}$  are all rms values and that  $\theta$  is the angle of the load impedance or the angle between the phase voltage and the phase current.

A second major advantage of three- phase systems for power distribution is that the three- phase system uses a lesser amount of wire than the single- phase system for the same line voltage  $V_{L}$  and the same absorbed power  $P_{L}$ . We will compare these cases and assume in both that the wires are of the same material (e.g., copper with resistivity  $\rho$ ), of the same length  $\ell$ , and that the loads are resistive (i.e., unity power factor). For the two- wire single- phase system in Fig. 12.21(a),  $I_{L} = P_{L} / V_{L}$ , so the power loss in the two wires is

$$
P_{\mathrm{loss}} = 2I_{L}^{2}R = 2R\frac{P_{L}^{2}}{V_{L}^{2}} \tag{12.54}
$$

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-14/63c420e9-9220-47ad-935a-09e6b2aeb2a8/3e9c4d9a34e32f2563b9b8a787b34ae67bfd427ba91de71ebfd7b4348c459627.jpg)  
Figure 12.21Comparing the power loss in (a) a single-phase system, and (b) a three-phase system.

For the three- wire three- phase system in Fig. 12.21(b),  $I_{L}^{\prime} = |\mathbf{I}_{a}| = |\mathbf{I}_{b}| = |\mathbf{I}_{c}| = P_{L} / \sqrt{3} V_{L}$  from Eq. (12.50). The power loss in the three wires is

$$
P_{\mathrm{loss}}^{\prime} = 3(I_{L}^{\prime})^{2}R^{\prime} = 3R^{\prime}\frac{P_{L}^{2}}{3V_{L}^{2}} = R^{\prime}\frac{P_{L}^{2}}{V_{L}^{2}} \tag{12.55}
$$

Equations (12.54) and (12.55) show that for the same total power delivered  $P_{L}$  and same line voltage  $V_{L}$

$$
\frac{P_{\mathrm{loss}}}{P_{\mathrm{loss}}^{\prime}} = \frac{2R}{R^{\prime}} \tag{12.56}
$$

But from Chapter 2,  $R = \rho \ell /\pi r^{2}$  and  $R^{\prime} = \rho \ell /\pi r^{\prime 2}$  , where  $r$  and  $r^{\prime}$  are the radii of the wires. Thus,

$$
\frac{P_{\mathrm{loss}}}{P_{\mathrm{loss}}^{\prime}} = \frac{2r^{\prime 2}}{r^{2}} \tag{12.57}
$$

If the same power loss is tolerated in both systems, then  $r^{2} = 2\mathrm{r}^{\prime 2}$  . The ratio of material required is determined by the number of wires and their volumes, so

$$
\begin{array}{r}{\frac{\mathrm{Material~for~single - phase}}{\mathrm{Material~for~three - phase}} = \frac{2(\pi r^{2}\ell)}{3(\pi r^{\prime 2}\ell)} = \frac{2r^{2}}{3r^{\prime 2}}}\\ {= \frac{2}{3} (2) = 1.333} \end{array} \tag{12.58}
$$

since  $r^{2} = 2r^{\prime 2}$  . Equation (12.58) shows that the single- phase system uses 33 percent more material than the three- phase system or that the threephase system uses only 75 percent of the material used in the equivalent single- phase system. In other words, considerably less material is needed to deliver the same power with a three- phase system than is required for a single- phase system.

Refer to the circuit in Fig. 12.13 (in Example 12.2). Determine the total average power, reactive power, and complex power at the source and at the load.

# Solution:

It is sufficient to consider one phase, as the system is balanced. For phase  $a$

$$
\mathbf{V}_{p} = 110\big / 0^{\circ}\mathrm{~V~}\qquad \mathrm{and}\qquad \mathbf{I}_{p} = 6.81\big / - 21.8^{\circ}\mathrm{~A~}
$$

Thus, at the source, the complex power absorbed is

$$
\begin{array}{r}{\mathbf{S}_{s} = -3\mathbf{V}_{p}\mathbf{I}_{p}^{*} = -3(110\big / 0^{\circ})(6.81\big / 21.8^{\circ})}\\ {= -2247\big / 21.8^{\circ} = -(2087 + j834.6) \mathrm{VA}} \end{array}
$$

The real or average power absorbed is  $- 2087$  W and the reactive power is  $- 834.6$  VAR.

At the load, the complex power absorbed is

$$
\mathbf{S}_{L} = 3|\mathbf{I}_{p}|^{2}\mathbf{Z}_{p}
$$

where  $\mathbf{Z}_{p} = 10 + j8 = 12.81 / 38.66^{\circ}$  and  $\mathbf{I}_{p} = \mathbf{I}_{a} = 6.81\big / - 21.8^{\circ}$  . Hence,

$$
\begin{array}{c}{\mathbf{S}_{L} = 3(6.81)^{2}12.81\big / 38.66^{\circ} = 1782\big / 38.66}\\ {= (1392 + j1113) \mathrm{VA}} \end{array}
$$

The real power absorbed is  $1391.7\mathrm{W}$  and the reactive power absorbed is 1113.3 VAR. The difference between the two complex powers is absorbed by the line impedance  $(5 - j2)\Omega$  . To show that this is the case, we find the complex power absorbed by the line as

$$
\mathbf{S}_{\ell} = 3|\mathbf{I}_{\ell}|^{2}\mathbf{Z}_{\ell} = 3(6.81)^{2}(5 - j2) = 695.6 - j278.3 \mathrm{VA}
$$

which is the difference between  $\mathbf{S}_{s}$  and  $\mathbf{S}_{L}$  ; that is,  $\mathbf{S}_{s} + \mathbf{S}_{\ell} + \mathbf{S}_{L} = 0$  , as expected.

For the Y- Y circuit in Practice Prob. 12.2, calculate the complex power at the source and at the load.

Answer:  $- (1054.2 + j843.3)$  VA,  $(1012 + j801.6)$  VA.

A three- phase motor can be regarded as a balanced Y- load. A three- phase motor draws  $5.6\mathrm{kW}$  when the line voltage is  $220~\mathrm{V}$  and the line current is  $18.2\mathrm{A}$ . Determine the power factor of the motor.

# Solution:

The apparent power is

$$
S = \sqrt{3} V_{L}I_{L} = \sqrt{3} (220)(18.2) = 6935.13\mathrm{~VA}
$$

Since the real power is

$$
P = \mathrm{S}\cos \theta = 5600\mathrm{W}
$$

the power factor is

$$
\mathrm{pf} = \cos \theta = \frac{P}{S} = \frac{5600}{6935.13} = 0.8075
$$

Calculate the line current required for a  $30 - \mathrm{kW}$  three- phase motor having a power factor of  $0.85$  lagging if it is connected to a balanced source with a line voltage of  $440~\mathrm{V}$ .

Answer: 46.31 A.

Two balanced loads are connected to a  $240 - \mathrm{kV}$  rms  $60 - \mathrm{Hz}$  line, as shown in Fig. 12.22(a). Load 1 draws  $30~\mathrm{kW}$  at a power factor of  $0.6$  lagging, while load 2 draws  $45~\mathrm{kVAR}$  at a power factor of  $0.8$  lagging. Assuming the abc sequence, determine: (a) the complex, real, and reactive powers absorbed by the combined load, (b) the line currents, and (c) the kVAR rating of the three capacitors  $\Delta$ - connected in parallel with the load that will raise the power factor to  $0.9$  lagging and the capacitance of each capacitor.

# Solution:

(a) For load 1, given that  $P_{1} = 30\mathrm{kW}$  and  $\cos \theta_{1} = 0.6$ , then  $\sin \theta_{1} = 0.8$ . Hence,

$$
S_{1} = \frac{P_{1}}{\cos\theta_{1}} = \frac{30\mathrm{kW}}{0.6} = 50\mathrm{kVA}
$$

and  $Q_{1} = S_{1}\sin \theta_{1} = 50(0.8) = 40\mathrm{kVAR}$ . Thus, the complex power due to load 1 is

$$
\mathbf{S}_1 = P_1 + jQ_1 = 30 + j40\mathrm{kVA} \tag{12.8.1}
$$

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-14/63c420e9-9220-47ad-935a-09e6b2aeb2a8/04ca6919d53f259d7e423c4b061e06e23032f4d975d370df7de0d0057517e660.jpg)  
Figure 12.22 For Example 12.8: (a) The original balanced loads, (b) the combined load with improved power factor.

For load 2, if  $Q_{2} = 45$  kVAR and cos  $\theta_{2} = 0.8$  , then sin  $\theta_{2} = 0.6$  . We find

$$
S_{2} = \frac{Q_{2}}{\sin\theta_{2}} = \frac{45\mathrm{kVA}}{0.6} = 75\mathrm{kVA}
$$

and  $P_{2} = S_{2}\cos \theta_{2}75(0.8) = 60\mathrm{kW}.$  Therefore the complex power due to load 2 is

$$
\mathbf{S}_{2} = P_{2} + j Q_{2} = 60 + j45\mathrm{kVA} \tag{12.8.2}
$$

From Eqs. (12.8.1) and (12.8.2), the total complex power absorbed by the load is

$$
\mathbf{S} = \mathbf{S}_{1} + \mathbf{S}_{2} = 90 + j85\mathrm{kVA} = 123.8\big / 43.36^{\circ}\mathrm{kVA} \tag{12.8.3}
$$

which has a power factor of cos  $43.36^{\circ} = 0.727$  lagging. The real power is then  $90\mathrm{kW}$  while the reactive power is  $85\mathrm{kVAR}$

It will help with the calculations to assume that the loads are wye connected and then to work with the phase voltages, i.e. the magnitude of  $V_{AN} = \left(240 / \sqrt{3}\right)\mathrm{kV}$

(b) Since  $S = 3\big((240\mathrm{kV} / \sqrt{3})I_{L}\big) = \sqrt{3} (240\mathrm{kV})I_{L}$

the magnitude of the line current is

$$
I_{L} = \frac{S}{\sqrt{3}(240,000)} \tag{12.8.4}
$$

We apply this to each load keeping in mind that the magnitude of the phase voltages is equal to  $(240 / \sqrt{3})\mathrm{kV}$  For load 1,

$$
I_{L1} = \frac{50,000}{\sqrt{3}240,000} = 120.28\mathrm{mA}
$$

Since the power factor is lagging, the line current lags the line voltage by  $\theta_{1} = \cos^{- 1}0.6 = 53.13^{\circ}$  . Thus,

$$
\mathbf{I}_{a1} = 120.28\big / - 53.13^{\circ}
$$

For load 2,

$$
I_{L2} = \frac{75,000}{\sqrt{3}240,000} = 180.42\mathrm{mA}
$$

and the line current lags the line voltage by  $\theta_{2} = \cos^{- 1}0.8 = 36.87^{\circ}$  . Hence,

$$
\mathbf{I}_{a2} = 180.42\big / - 36.87^{\circ}
$$

The total line current is

$$
\begin{array}{r l} & {\mathbf{I}_{a} = \mathbf{I}_{a1} + \mathbf{I}_{a2} = 120.28\big / - 53.13^{\circ} + 180.42\big / - 36.87^{\circ}}\\ & {\qquad = (72.168 - j96.224) + (144.336 - j108.252)}\\ & {\qquad = 216.5 - j204.472 = 297.8\big / - 43.36^{\circ}\mathrm{mA}} \end{array}
$$

Alternatively, we could obtain the current from the total complex power using Eq. (12.8.4) as

$$
I_{L} = \frac{123,800}{\sqrt{3}240,000} = 297.82\mathrm{mA}
$$

and

$$
\mathbf{I}_{a} = 297.82\big / - 43.36^{\circ}\mathrm{mA}
$$

which is the same as before. The other line currents,  $\mathbf{I}_{b2}$  and  $\mathbf{I}_{c a}$  can be obtained according to the abc sequence (i.e.,  $\mathbf{I}_{b} = 297.82\big / - 163.36^{\circ}\mathrm{mA}$  and  $\mathbf{I}_{c} = 297.82\big / 76.64^{\circ}\mathrm{mA}\big)$

(c) We can find the reactive power needed to bring the power factor to 0.9 lagging using Eq. (11.59),

$$
Q C = P(\tan \theta_{\mathrm{old}} - \tan \theta_{\mathrm{new}})
$$

where  $P = 90\mathrm{kW}$ $\theta_{\mathrm{old}} = 43.36^{\circ}$  , and  $\theta_{\mathrm{new}} = \cos^{- 1}0.9 = 25.84^{\circ}$  . Hence,

$$
Q_{C} = 90,000(\tan 43.36^{\circ} - \tan 25.84^{\circ}) = 41.4\mathrm{kVAR}
$$

This reactive power is for the three capacitors. For each capacitor, the rating  $Q_{C}^{\prime} = 13.8\mathrm{kVAR}$  . From Eq. (11.60), the required capacitance is

$$
C = \frac{Q_C'}{\omega V_{\mathrm{rms}}^2}
$$

Since the capacitors are  $\Delta$  - connected as shown in Fig. 12.22(b),  $V_{\mathrm{rms}}$  in the above formula is the line- to- line or line voltage, which is  $240\mathrm{kV}$  Thus,

$$
C = \frac{13,800}{(2\pi 60)(240,000)^2} = 635.5\mathrm{pF}
$$

Assume that the two balanced loads in Fig. 12.22(a) are supplied by an 840- V rms 60- Hz line. Load 1 is Y- connected with  $30 + j40\Omega$  per phase, while load 2 is a balanced three- phase motor drawing  $48~\mathrm{kW}$  at a power factor of 0.8 lagging. Assuming the abc sequence, calculate: (a) the complex power absorbed by the combined load, (b) the kVAR rating of each of the three capacitors  $\Delta$  - connected in parallel with the load to raise the power factor to unity, and (c) the current drawn from the supply at unity power factor condition.

Answer: (a)  $56.47 + j47.29\mathrm{kVA}$  b15.76 kVAR,c)38.81A.

# 12.8 Unbalanced Three-Phase Systems

This chapter would be incomplete without mentioning unbalanced threephase systems. An unbalanced system is caused by two possible situations: (1) The source voltages are not equal in magnitude and/or differ in phase by angles that are unequal, or (2) load impedances are unequal. Thus,

An unbalanced system is due to unbalanced voltage sources or an unbalanced load.

To simplify analysis, we will assume balanced source voltages, but an unbalanced load.

Unbalanced three- phase systems are solved by direct application of mesh and nodal analysis. Figure 12.23 shows an example of an unbalanced three- phase system that consists of balanced source voltages (not shown in the figure) and an unbalanced Y- connected load (shown in the figure). Since the load is unbalanced,  $\mathbf{Z}_{A},\mathbf{Z}_{B}$  and  $\mathbf{Z}_{C}$  are not equal. The line currents are determined by Ohm's law as

$$
\mathbf{I}_a = \frac{\mathbf{V}_{AN}}{\mathbf{Z}_A},\qquad \mathbf{I}_b = \frac{\mathbf{V}_{BN}}{\mathbf{Z}_B},\qquad \mathbf{I}_c = \frac{\mathbf{V}_{CN}}{\mathbf{Z}_C} \tag{12.59}
$$

Figure 12.23 Unbalanced three-phase Y-connected load.

A special technique for handling unbalanced three- phase systems is the method of symmetrical components, which is beyond the scope of this text.

This set of unbalanced line currents produces current in the neutral line, which is not zero as in a balanced system. Applying KCL at node  $N$  gives the neutral line current as

$$
\mathbf{I}_{n} = -(\mathbf{I}_{a} + \mathbf{I}_{b} + \mathbf{I}_{c}) \tag{12.60}
$$

In a three- wire system where the neutral line is absent, we can still find the line currents  $\mathbf{I}_{a}, \mathbf{I}_{b}$ , and  $\mathbf{I}_{c}$  using mesh analysis. At node  $N$ , KCL must be satisfied so that  $\mathbf{I}_{a} + \mathbf{I}_{b} + \mathbf{I}_{c} = 0$  in this case. The same could be done for an unbalanced  $\Delta$ - Y, Y-  $\Delta$ , or  $\Delta$ -  $\Delta$  three- wire system. As mentioned earlier, in long distance power transmission, conductors in multiples of three (multiple three- wire systems) are used, with the earth itself acting as the neutral conductor.

To calculate power in an unbalanced three- phase system requires that we find the power in each phase using Eqs. (12.46) to (12.49). The total power is not simply three times the power in one phase but the sum of the powers in the three phases.

The unbalanced Y- load of Fig. 12.23 has balanced voltages of  $100 \mathrm{~V}$  and the acb sequence. Calculate the line currents and the neutral current. Take  $\mathbf{Z}_{A} = 15 \Omega$ ,  $\mathbf{Z}_{B} = 10 + j5 \Omega$ ,  $\mathbf{Z}_{C} = 6 - j8 \Omega$ .

# Solution:

Using Eq. (12.59), the line currents are

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{\mathbf{I}_{a}=\frac{100/0^{\circ}}{15}=6.67/0^{\circ}\mathrm{~A~}}}\\ {{\mathbf{I}_{b}=\frac{100/120^{\circ}}{10+j5}=\frac{100/120^{\circ}}{11.18/26.56^{\circ}}=8.94/93.44^{\circ}\mathrm{~A~}}}\\ {{\mathbf{I}_{c}=\frac{100/-120^{\circ}}{6-j8}=\frac{100/-120^{\circ}}{10/-53.13^{\circ}}=10/-66.87^{\circ}\mathrm{~A~}}}\end{array}
$$

Using Eq. (12.60), the current in the neutral line is

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{\mathbf{I}_{n}=-(\mathbf{I}_{a}+\mathbf{I}_{b}+\mathbf{I}_{c})=-(6.67-0.54+j8.92+3.93-j9.2)}}\\ {{{}}}\\ {{=-10.06+j0.28=10.06/178.4^{\circ}\mathrm{~A~}}}}\end{array}
$$

Figure 12.25 For Example 12.10.

# Solution:

(a) We use mesh analysis to find the required currents. For mesh 1,

$$
120\big / - 120^{\circ} - 120\big / 0^{\circ} + (10 + j5)\mathbf{I}_{1} - 10\mathbf{I}_{2} = 0
$$

or

$$
(10 + j5)\mathbf{I}_{1} - 10\mathbf{I}_{2} = 120\sqrt{3} \underline{/30^{\circ}} \tag{12.10.1}
$$

For mesh 2,

$$
120\big / 120^{\circ} - 120\big / - 120^{\circ} + (10 - j10)\mathbf{I}_{2} - 10\mathbf{I}_{1} = 0
$$

or

$$
-10\mathbf{I}_{1} + (10 - j10)\mathbf{I}_{2} = 120\sqrt{3} \underline{/ - 90^{\circ}} \tag{12.10.2}
$$

Equations (12.10.1) and (12.10.2) form a matrix equation:

$$
\left[ \begin{array}{cc}10 + j5 & -10 \\ -10 & 10 - j10 \end{array} \right] \left[ \begin{array}{c}\mathbf{I}_{1} \\ \mathbf{I}_{2} \end{array} \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{c}120\sqrt{3} \underline{/30^{\circ}} \\ 120\sqrt{3} \underline{/ - 90^{\circ}} \end{array} \right]
$$

The determinants are

$$
\begin{array}{r l} & {\Delta = \left| \begin{array}{c c}{10 + j5} & {-10}\\ {-10} & {10 - j10} \end{array} \right| = 50 - j50 = 70.71\underline{{/ - 45^{\circ}}}}\\ & {\Delta_{1} = \left| \begin{array}{c c}{120\sqrt{3} /30^{\circ}} & {-10}\\ {120\sqrt{3} / - 90^{\circ}} & {10 - j10} \end{array} \right| = 207.85(13.66 - j13.66)}\\ & {\qquad = 4015\underline{{/ - 45^{\circ}}}}\\ & {\Delta_{2} = \left| \begin{array}{c c}{10 + j5} & {120\sqrt{3} /30^{\circ}}\\ {-10} & {120\sqrt{3} / - 90^{\circ}} \end{array} \right| = 207.85(13.66 - j5)}\\ & {\qquad = 3023.4\underline{{/ - 20.1^{\circ}}}} \end{array}
$$

The mesh currents are

$$
\mathbf{I}_{1} = \frac{\Delta_{1}}{\Delta} = \frac{4015.23 / - 45^{\circ}}{70.71 / - 45^{\circ}} = 56.78 \mathrm{~A}
$$

$$
\mathbf{I}_{2} = \frac{\Delta_{2}}{\Delta} = \frac{3023.4 / - 20.1^{\circ}}{70.71 / - 45^{\circ}} = 42.75 / 24.9^{\circ} \mathrm{~A}
$$

The line currents are

$$
\begin{array}{r l} & {\mathbf{I}_{a} = \mathbf{I}_{1} = 56.78\mathrm{~A},\qquad \mathbf{I}_{c} = -\mathbf{I}_{2} = 42.75\big / - 155.1^{\circ}\mathrm{~A}}\\ & {\mathbf{I}_{b} = \mathbf{I}_{2} - \mathbf{I}_{1} = 38.78 + j18 - 56.78 = 25.46\big / 135^{\circ}\mathrm{~A}} \end{array}
$$

(b) We can now calculate the complex power absorbed by the load. For phase A,

$$
\mathbf{S}_{A} = \mathbb{I}_{a}j^{2}\mathbf{Z}_{A} = (56.78)^{2}(j5) = j16,120\mathrm{~VA}
$$

For phase B,

$$
\mathbf{S}_{B} = \mathbb{I}_{b}j^{2}\mathbf{Z}_{B} = (25.46)^{2}(10) = 6480\mathrm{~VA}
$$

For phase C,

$$
\mathbf{S}_{C} = \mathbb{I}_{c}j^{2}\mathbf{Z}_{C} = (42.75)^{2}(-j10) = -j18,276\mathrm{~VA}
$$

The total complex power absorbed by the load is

$$
\mathbf{S}_{L} = \mathbf{S}_{A} + \mathbf{S}_{B} + \mathbf{S}_{C} = 6480 - j2156\mathrm{~VA}
$$

(c) We check the result above by finding the power absorbed by the source. For the voltage source in phase  $a$

$$
\mathbf{S}_{a} = -\mathbf{V}_{an}\mathbf{I}_{a}^{*} = -(120\big / 0^{\circ})(56.78) = -6813.6\mathrm{~VA}
$$

For the source in phase  $b$

$$
\begin{array}{r}{\mathbf{S}_{b} = -\mathbf{V}_{an}\mathbf{I}_{b}^{*} = -(120\big / - 120^{\circ})(25.46\big / - 135^{\circ})}\\ {= -3055.2\big / 105^{\circ} = 790 - j2951.1\mathrm{~VA}} \end{array}
$$

For the source in phase  $c$

$$
\begin{array}{r}{\mathbf{S}_{c} = -\mathbf{V}_{b a}\mathbf{I}_{c}^{*} = -(120\big / 120^{\circ})(42.75\big / 155.1^{\circ})}\\ {= -5130\big / 275.1^{\circ} = -456.03 + j5109.7\mathrm{~VA}} \end{array}
$$

The total complex power absorbed by the three- phase source is

$$
\mathbf{S}_{s} = \mathbf{S}_{a} + \mathbf{S}_{b} + \mathbf{S}_{c} = -6480 + j2156\mathrm{~VA}
$$

showing that  $\mathbf{S}_{s} + \mathbf{S}_{L} = 0$  and confirming the conservation principle of ac power.

# 12.9 PSpice for Three-Phase Circuits

12.9 PSpice for Three- Phase CircuitsPSpice can be used to analyze three- phase balanced or unbalanced circuits in the same way it is used to analyze single- phase ac circuits. However, a delta- connected source presents two major problems to PSpice. First, a delta- connected source is a loop of voltage sources—which PSpice does not like. To avoid this problem, we insert a resistor of negligible resistance (say,  $1\mu \Omega$  per phase) into each phase of the delta- connected source. Second, the delta- connected source does not provide a convenient node for the ground node, which is necessary to run PSpice. This problem can be eliminated by inserting balanced wye- connected large resistors (say,  $1\mathrm{M}\Omega$  per phase) in the delta- connected source so that the neutral node of the wye- connected resistors serves as the ground node 0. Example 12.12 will illustrate this.

For the balanced Y-  $\Delta$  circuit in Fig. 12.27, use PSpice to find the line current  $\mathbf{I}_{aA}$ , the phase voltage  $\mathbf{V}_{AB}$ , and the phase current  $\mathbf{I}_{AC}$ . Assume that the source frequency is  $60\mathrm{Hz}$ .

# Solution:

Solution:The schematic is shown in Fig. 12.28. The pseudocomponents IPRINT are inserted in the appropriate lines to obtain  $\mathbf{I}_{aA}$  and  $\mathbf{I}_{AC}$ , while VPRINT2 is inserted between nodes A and B to print differential voltage  $\mathbf{V}_{AB}$ . We set the attributes of IPRINT and VPRINT2 each to  $AC = \text{yes}$ , MAG = yes, PHASE = yes, to print only the magnitude and phase of the currents and voltages. As a single- frequency analysis, we select Analysis/Setup/AC Sweep and enter Total  $Pts = 1$ , Start  $Freq = 60$ , and Final  $Freq = 60$ . Once the circuit is saved, it is simulated by selecting Analysis/Simulate. The output file includes the following:

Consider the unbalanced  $\Delta - \Delta$  circuit in Fig. 12.30. Use PSpice to find the generator current  $\mathbf{I}_{ab}$ , the line current  $\mathbf{I}_{bB}$ , and the phase current  $\mathbf{I}_{BC}$ .

3. Alternative. Although there are different approaches to solving this problem, the use of PSpice is mandated. Therefore, we will not use another approach.

4. Attempt. As mentioned above, we avoid the loop of voltage sources by inserting a  $1 - \mu \Omega$  series resistor in the delta-connected source. To provide a ground node 0, we insert balanced wye-connected resistors (1 MΩ per phase) in the delta-connected source, as shown in the schematic in Fig. 12.31. Three IPRINT pseudocomponents with their attributes are inserted to be able to

get the required currents  $\mathbf{I}_{ab}$ ,  $\mathbf{I}_{bB}$ , and  $\mathbf{I}_{BC}$ . Since the operating frequency is not given and the inductances and capacitances should be specified instead of impedances, we assume  $\omega = 1$  rad/s so that  $f = 1 / 2\pi = 0.159155 \mathrm{~Hz}$ . Thus,

$$
L = \frac{X_{L}}{\omega} \qquad \text{and} \qquad C = \frac{1}{\omega X_{C}}
$$

We select Analysis/Setup/AC Sweep and enter Total  $Pts = 1$ , Start  $Freq = 0.159155$ , and Final  $Freq = 0.159155$ . Once the schematic is saved, we select Analysis/Simulate to simulate the circuit. The output file includes:

$$
\begin{array}{r l r l r l} & {\mathsf{F R E Q}} & & {\mathsf{I M}(\mathsf{V\_P R I N T1})} & & {\mathsf{I P}(\mathsf{V\_P R I N T1})}\\ & {1.592\mathsf{E} - 01} & & {9.106\mathsf{E} + 00} & & {1.685\mathsf{E} + 02}\\ & {\mathsf{F R E Q}} & & {\mathsf{I M}(\mathsf{V\_P R I N T2})} & & {\mathsf{I P}(\mathsf{V\_P R I N T2})}\\ & {1.592\mathsf{E} - 01} & & {5.959\mathsf{E} + 00} & & {-1.772\mathsf{E} + 02}\\ & {\mathsf{F R E Q}} & & {\mathsf{I M}(\mathsf{V\_P R I N T3})} & & {\mathsf{I P}(\mathsf{V\_P R I N T3})}\\ & {1.592\mathsf{E} - 01} & & {5.500\mathsf{E} + 00} & & {1.725\mathsf{E} + 02} \end{array}
$$

which yields

$$
I_{ab} = 5.595 / - 177.2^{\circ} \mathrm{~A}, I_{bB} = 9.106 / 168.5^{\circ} \mathrm{~A}, \text{and}
$$

$$
I_{BC} = 5.5 / 172.5^{\circ} \mathrm{~A}
$$

5. Evaluate. We can check our results by using mesh analysis. Let the loop  $aABb$  be loop 1, the loop  $bBCc$  be loop 2, and the loop  $ACB$  be loop 3, with the three loop currents all flowing in the clockwise direction. We then end up with the following loop equations:

Loop 1

$$
(54 + j10)I_{1} - (2 + j5)I_{2} - (50)I_{3} = 208 / 10^{\circ} = 204.8 + j36.12
$$

# 12.10 Applications

Both wye and delta source connections have important practical applications. The wye source connection is used for long distance transmission of electric power, where resistive losses  $(I^{2}R)$  should be minimal. This is

due to the fact that the wye connection gives a line voltage that is  $\sqrt{3}$  greater than the delta connection; hence, for the same power, the line current is  $\sqrt{3}$  smaller. In addition, delta connected are also undesirable due to the potential of having disastrous circulating currents. Sometimes, using transformers, we create the equivalent of delta connect source. This conversion from three- phase to single- phase is required in residential wiring, because household lighting and appliances use single- phase power. Three- phase power is used in industrial wiring where a large power is required. In some applications, it is immaterial whether the load is wye- or delta- connected. For example, both connections are satisfactory with induction motors. In fact, some manufacturers connect a motor in delta for  $220\mathrm{V}$  and in wye for  $440\mathrm{V}$  so that one line of motors can be readily adapted to two different voltages.Here we consider two practical applications of those concepts covered in this chapter: power measurement in three- phase circuits and residential wiring.

Here we consider two practical applications of those concepts covered in this chapter: power measurement in three- phase circuits and residential wiring.

# 12.10.1 Three-Phase Power Measurement

Section 11.9 presented the wattmeter as the instrument for measuring the average (or real) power in single- phase circuits. A single wattmeter can also measure the average power in a three- phase system that is balanced, so that  $P_{1} = P_{2} = P_{3}$ ; the total power is three times the reading of that one wattmeter. However, two or three single- phase wattmeters are necessary to measure power if the system is unbalanced. The three- wattmeter method of power measurement, shown in Fig. 12.33, will work regardless of whether the load is balanced or unbalanced, wye- or delta- connected. The three- wattmeter method is well suited for power measurement in a three- phase system where the power factor is constantly changing. The total average power is the algebraic sum of the three wattmeter readings,\[ P_{T} = P_{1} + P_{2} + P_{3} \]where  $P_{1}, P_{2}$ , and  $P_{3}$  correspond to the readings of wattmeters  $W_{1}, W_{2}$ , and  $W_{3}$ , respectively. Notice that the common or reference point  $o$  in Fig. 12.33 is selected arbitrarily. If the load is wye- connected, point  $o$  can be connected to the neutral point  $n$ . For a delta- connected load, point  $o$  can be connected to any point. If point  $o$  is connected to point  $b$ , for example, the voltage coil in wattmeter  $W_{2}$  reads zero and  $P_{2} = 0$ , indicating that wattmeter  $W_{2}$  is not necessary. Thus, two wattmeters are sufficient to measure the total power.The two- wattmeter method is the most commonly used method for three- phase power measurement. The two wattmeters must be properly connected to any two phases, as shown typically in Fig. 12.34. Notice that the current coil of each wattmeter measures the line current, while the respective voltage coil is connected between the line and the third line and measures the line voltage. Also notice that the  $\pm$  terminal of the voltage coil is connected to the line to which the corresponding current coil is connected. Although the individual wattmeters no longer read the power taken by any particular phase, the algebraic sum of the two wattmeter readings equals the total average power absorbed by the load, regardless of whether it is wye- or delta- connected, balanced or

$$
P_{T} = P_{1} + P_{2} + P_{3} \tag{12.61}
$$

where  $P_{1},P_{2}$  , and  $P_{3}$  correspond to the readings of wattmeters  $W_{1},W_{2}$  and  $W_{3}$  , respectively. Notice that the common or reference point  $o$  in Fig. 12.33 is selected arbitrarily. If the load is wye- connected, point  $o$  can be connected to the neutral point  $n$  . For a delta- connected load, point  $o$  can be connected to any point. If point  $o$  is connected to point  $b$  , for example, the voltage coil in wattmeter  $W_{2}$  reads zero and  $P_{2} = 0$  , indicating that wattmeter  $W_{2}$  is not necessary. Thus, two wattmeters are sufficient to measure the total power.

The two- wattmeter method is the most commonly used method for three- phase power measurement. The two wattmeters must be properly connected to any two phases, as shown typically in Fig. 12.34. Notice that the current coil of each wattmeter measures the line current, while the respective voltage coil is connected between the line and the third line and measures the line voltage. Also notice that the  $\pm$  terminal of the voltage coil is connected to the line to which th e corresponding current coil is connected. Although the individual wattmeters no longer read the power taken by any particular phase, the algebraic sum of the two wattmeter readings equals the total average power absorbed by the load, regardless of whether it is wye- or delta- connected, balanced or

unbalanced. The total real power is equal to the algebraic sum of the two wattmeter readings,

$$
P_{T} = P_{1} + P_{2} \tag{12.62}
$$

We will show here that the method works for a balanced three- phase system.

Consider the balanced, wye- connected load in Fig. 12.35. Our objective is to apply the two- wattmeter method to find the average power absorbed by the load. Assume the source is in the abc sequence and the load impedance  $\mathbf{Z}_{Y} = Z_{Y} / \theta$  . Due to the load impedance, each voltage coil leads its current coil by  $\theta$  , so that the power factor is cos  $\theta$  . We recall that each line voltage leads the corresponding phase voltage by  $30^{\circ}$  . Thus, the total phase difference between the phase current  $\mathbf{I}_{a}$  and line voltage  $\mathbf{V}_{a b}$  is  $\theta +30^{\circ}$  , and the average power read by wattmeter  $W_{1}$  is

$$
P_{1} = \mathrm{Re}[\mathbf{V}_{a b}\mathbf{I}_{a}^{*}] = V_{a b}I_{a}\cos (\theta +30^{\circ}) = V_{L}I_{L}\cos (\theta +30^{\circ}) \tag{12.63}
$$

Figure 12.35 Two-wattmeter method applied to a balanced wye load.

Similarly, we can show that the average power read by wattmeter 2 is

$$
P_{2} = \mathrm{Re}[\mathbf{V}_{c b}\mathbf{I}_{c}^{*}] = V_{c b}I_{c}\cos (\theta -30^{\circ}) = V_{L}I_{L}\cos (\theta -30^{\circ}) \tag{12.64}
$$

We now use the trigonometric identities

$$
\begin{array}{r}{\cos (A + B) = \cos A\cos B - \sin A\sin B}\\ {\cos (A - B) = \cos A\cos B + \sin A\sin B} \end{array} \tag{12.65}
$$

to find the sum and the difference of the two wattmeter readings in Eqs. (12.63) and (12.64):

$$
\begin{array}{r l} & {P_{1} + P_{2} = V_{L}I_{L}[\cos (\theta +30^{\circ}) + \cos (\theta -30^{\circ})]}\\ & {\qquad = V_{L}I_{L}(\cos \theta \cos 30^{\circ} - \sin \theta \sin 30^{\circ}}\\ & {\qquad \qquad +\cos \theta \cos 30^{\circ} + \sin \theta \sin 30^{\circ})}\\ & {\qquad = V_{L}I_{L}2\cos 30^{\circ}\cos \theta = \sqrt{3} V_{L}I_{L}\cos \theta} \end{array} \tag{12.66}
$$

since 2 cos  $30^{\circ} = \sqrt{3}$  . Comparing Eq. (12.66) with Eq. (12.50) shows that the sum of the wattmeter readings gives the total average power,

$$
P_{T} = P_{1} + P_{2} \tag{12.67}
$$

Similarly,

$$
\begin{array}{r l} & {P_{1} - P_{2} = V_{L}I_{L}[\cos (\theta +30^{\circ}) - \cos (\theta -30^{\circ})]}\\ & {\qquad = V_{L}I_{L}(\cos \theta \cos 30^{\circ} - \sin \theta \sin 30^{\circ}}\\ & {\qquad -\cos \theta \cos 30^{\circ} - \sin \theta \sin 30^{\circ})}\\ & {\qquad = -V_{L}I_{L}2\sin 30^{\circ}\sin \theta}\\ & {P_{2} - P_{1} = V_{L}I_{L}\sin \theta} \end{array} \tag{12.68}
$$

since  $2 \sin 30^{\circ} = 1$ . Comparing Eq. (12.68) with Eq. (12.51) shows that the difference of the wattmeter readings is proportional to the total reactive power, or

$$
\boxed{Q_{T} = \sqrt{3}(P_{2} - P_{1})} \tag{12.69}
$$

From Eqs. (12.67) and (12.69), the total apparent power can be obtained as

$$
S_{T} = \sqrt{P_{T}^{2} + Q_{T}^{2}} \tag{12.70}
$$

Dividing Eq. (12.69) by Eq. (12.67) gives the tangent of the power factor angle as

$$
\tan \theta = \frac{Q_{T}}{P_{T}} = \sqrt{3}\frac{P_{2} - P_{1}}{P_{2} + P_{1}} \tag{12.71}
$$

from which we can obtain the power factor as  $\mathrm{pf} = \cos \theta$ . Thus, the two- wattmeter method not only provides the total real and reactive powers, it can also be used to compute the power factor. From Eqs. (12.67), (12.69), and (12.71), we conclude that:

1. If  $P_{2} = P_{1}$ , the load is resistive.

2. If  $P_{2} > P_{1}$ , the load is inductive.

3. If  $P_{2}< P_{1}$ , the load is capacitive.

Although these results are derived from a balanced wye- connected load, they are equally valid for a balanced delta- connected load. However, the two- wattmeter method cannot be used for power measurement in a three- phase four- wire system unless the current through the neutral line is zero. We use the three- wattmeter method to measure the real power in a three- phase four- wire system.

Three wattmeters  $W_{1}$ ,  $W_{2}$ , and  $W_{3}$  are connected, respectively, to phases  $a$ ,  $b$ , and  $c$  to measure the total power absorbed by the unbalanced wye- connected load in Example 12.9 (see Fig. 12.23). (a) Predict the wattmeter readings. (b) Find the total power absorbed.

# Solution:

Part of the problem is already solved in Example 12.9. Assume that the wattmeters are properly connected as in Fig. 12.36.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-14/63c420e9-9220-47ad-935a-09e6b2aeb2a8/11fcca475358d4f857c42aded264e1dc87215aa6652319eb7f3bb25dbb3ef2a1.jpg)  
Figure 12.36 For Example 12.13.

(a) From Example 12.9,

$$
\mathbf{V}_{AN} = 100 / 0^{\circ},\qquad \mathbf{V}_{BN} = 100 / 120^{\circ},\qquad \mathbf{V}_{CN} = 100 / - 120^{\circ}\mathrm{~V~}
$$

while

$$
\mathbf{I}_a = 6.67 / 0^\circ ,\qquad \mathbf{I}_b = 8.94 / 93.44^\circ ,\qquad \mathbf{I}_c = 10 / - 66.87^\circ \mathrm{~A~}
$$

We calculate the wattmeter readings as follows:

$$
\begin{array}{r l} & {P_{1} = \mathrm{Re}(\mathbf{V}_{A N}\mathbf{I}_{a}^{*}) = V_{A N}I_{a}\cos (\theta_{\mathbf{V}_{A N}} - \theta_{\mathbf{I}_{a}})}\\ & {\qquad = 100\times 6.67\times \cos (0^{\circ} - 0^{\circ}) = 667\mathrm{~W~}}\\ & {P_{2} = \mathrm{Re}(\mathbf{V}_{B N}\mathbf{I}_{b}^{*}) = V_{B N}I_{b}\cos (\theta_{\mathbf{V}_{B N}} - \theta_{\mathbf{I}_{b}})}\\ & {\qquad = 100\times 8.94\times \cos (120^{\circ} - 93.44^{\circ}) = 800\mathrm{~W~}}\\ & {P_{3} = \mathrm{Re}(\mathbf{V}_{C N}\mathbf{I}_{c}^{*}) = V_{C N}I_{c}\cos (\theta_{\mathbf{V}_{C N}} - \theta_{\mathbf{I}_{c}})}\\ & {\qquad = 100\times 10\times \cos (-120^{\circ} + 66.87^{\circ}) = 600\mathrm{~W~}} \end{array}
$$

(b) The total power absorbed is

$$
P_{T} = P_{1} + P_{2} + P_{3} = 667 + 800 + 600 = 2067\mathrm{~W~}
$$

We can find the power absorbed by the resistors in Fig. 12.36 and use that to check or confirm this result

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{P_{T}=|I_{a}|^{2}(15)+|I_{b}|^{2}(10)+|I_{c}|^{2}(6)}}\\ {{=6.67^{2}(15)+8.94^{2}(10)+10^{2}(6)}}\\ {{=667+800+600=2067\mathrm{~W~}}}\end{array}
$$

which is exactly the same thing.

# Practice Problem 12.13

Practice Problem 12.13Repeat Example 12.13 for the network in Fig. 12.24 (see Practice Prob. 12.9). Hint: Connect the reference point  $o$  in Fig. 12.33 to point  $B$ .

Answer: (a) 13.175 kW, 0 W, 29.91 kW, (b) 43.08 kW.

# Example 12.14

Example 12.14The two- wattmeter method produces wattmeter readings  $P_{1} = 1560 \mathrm{W}$  and  $P_{2} = 2100 \mathrm{W}$  when connected to a delta- connected load. If the line voltage is  $220 \mathrm{V}$ , calculate: (a) the per- phase average power, (b) the per- phase reactive power, (c) the power factor, and (d) the phase impedance.

# Solution:

We can apply the given results to the delta- connected load.

(a) The total real or average power is

$$
P_{T} = P_{1} + P_{2} = 1560 + 2100 = 3660 \mathrm{W}
$$

The per- phase average power is then

$$
P_{p} = \frac{1}{3} P_{T} = 1220 \mathrm{W}
$$

(b) The total reactive power is

$$
Q_{T} = \sqrt{3} (P_{2} - P_{1}) = \sqrt{3} (2100 - 1560) = 935.3 \mathrm{VAR}
$$

so that the per- phase reactive power is

$$
Q_{p} = \frac{1}{3} Q_{T} = 311.77 \mathrm{VAR}
$$

(c) The power angle is

$$
\theta = \tan^{-1} \frac{Q_{T}}{P_{T}} = \tan^{-1} \frac{935.3}{3660} = 14.33^{\circ}
$$

Hence, the power factor is

$$
\cos \theta = 0.9689 (\mathrm{lagging})
$$

It is a lagging pf because  $Q_{T}$  is positive or  $P_{2} > P_{1}$

(d) The phase impedance is  $\mathbf{Z}_{p} = \mathbf{Z}_{p} / \theta$ . We know that  $\theta$  is the same as the pf angle; that is,  $\theta = 14.33^{\circ}$

$$
Z_{p} = \frac{V_{p}}{I_{p}}
$$

We recall that for a delta- connected load,  $V_{p} = V_{L} = 220 \mathrm{V}$ . From Eq. (12.46),

$$
P_{p} = V_{p} I_{p} \cos \theta \quad \Rightarrow \quad I_{p} = \frac{1220}{220 \times 0.9689} = 5.723 \mathrm{A}
$$

Hence,

$$
Z_{p} = \frac{V_{p}}{I_{p}} = \frac{220}{5.723} = 38.44 \Omega
$$

and

$$
\mathbf{Z}_{p} = 38.44 / 14.33^{\circ} \Omega
$$

Let the line voltage  $V_{L} = 208 \mathrm{V}$  and the wattmeter readings of the balanced system in Fig. 12.35 be  $P_{1} = - 560 \mathrm{W}$  and  $P_{2} = 800 \mathrm{W}$ . Determine:

(a) the total average power

(b) the total reactive power

(c) the power factor

(d) the phase impedance

Is the impedance inductive or capacitive?

Answer: (a) 240 W, (b) 2.356 kVAR, (c) 0.1014, (d) 18.25/84.18° Ω, inductive.

# Example 12.15

The three- phase balanced load in Fig. 12.35 has impedance per phase of  $\mathbf{Z}_{Y} = 8 + j6\Omega$  . If the load is connected to 208- V lines, predict the readings of the wattmeters  $W_{1}$  and  $W_{2}$  . Find  $P_{T}$  and  $Q_{T}$

# Solution:

The impedance per phase is

$$
\mathbf{Z}_{Y} = 8 + j6 = 10\big / 36.87^{\circ}\Omega
$$

so that the pf angle is  $36.87^{\circ}$  . Since the line voltage  $V_{L} = 208~\mathrm{V},$  the line current is

$$
I_{L} = \frac{V_{p}}{|Z_{Y}|} = \frac{208 / \sqrt{3}}{10} = 12\mathrm{~A~}
$$

Then

$$
\begin{array}{l}P_{1} = V_{L}I_{L}\cos (\theta +30^{\circ}) = 208\times 12\times \cos (36.87^{\circ} + 30^{\circ})\\ \quad = 980.48\mathrm{~W~} \end{array}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l}P_{2} = V_{L}I_{L}\cos (\theta -30^{\circ}) = 208\times 12\times \cos (36.87^{\circ} - 30^{\circ})\\ \quad = 2478.1\mathrm{~W~} \end{array}
$$

Thus, wattmeter 1 reads  $980.48~\mathrm{W},$  while wattmeter 2 reads  $2478.1~\mathrm{W}.$  Since  $P_{2} > P_{1}$  , the load is inductive. This is evident from the load  $\mathbf{Z}_{Y}$  itself. Next,

$$
P_{T} = P_{1} + P_{2} = 3.459\mathrm{kW}
$$

and

$$
Q_{T} = \sqrt{3} (P_{2} - P_{1}) = \sqrt{3} (1497.6)\mathrm{VAR} = 2.594\mathrm{kVAR}
$$

# Practice Problem 12.15

Answer: 6.167 kW, 0.8021 kW, 6.969 kW, - 9.292 kVAR.

(The electricity may also be supplied at 110, 115, or  $117\mathrm{~V},$  depending on the location.) The local power company supplies the house with a three- wire ac system. Typically, as in Fig. 12.37, the line voltage of, say,  $12,000\mathrm{~V}$  is stepped down to  $120 / 240\mathrm{~V}$  with a transformer (more details on transformers in the next chapter). The three wires coming from the transformer are typically colored red (hot), black (hot), and white (neutral). As shown in Fig. 12.38, the two 120- V voltages are opposite in phase and hence add up to zero. That is,  $\mathbf{V}_{W} = 0\big / 0^{\circ},\mathbf{V}_{B} = 120\big / 0^{\circ},\mathbf{V}_{R} = 120\big / 180^{\circ} = - \mathbf{V}_{B}.$

$$
\mathbf{V}_{BR} = \mathbf{V}_{B} - \mathbf{V}_{R} = \mathbf{V}_{B} - (-\mathbf{V}_{B}) = 2\mathbf{V}_{B} = 240 / 0^{\circ}. \tag{12.72}
$$

Figure 12.38 Single-phase three-wire residential wiring.

Since most appliances are designed to operate with  $120\mathrm{V}$ , the lighting and appliances are connected to the  $120\mathrm{V}$  lines, as illustrated in Fig. 12.39 for a room. Notice in Fig. 12.37 that all appliances are connected in parallel. Heavy appliances that consume large currents, such as air conditioners, dishwashers, ovens, and laundry machines, are connected to the  $240\mathrm{V}$  power line.

Because of the dangers of electricity, house wiring is carefully regulated by a code drawn by local ordinances and by the National Electrical Code (NEC). To avoid trouble, insulation, grounding, fuses, and circuit breakers are used. Modern wiring codes require a third wire for a separate ground. The ground wire does not carry power like the neutral wire but enables appliances to have a separate ground connection. Figure 12.40 shows the connection of the receptacle to a  $120\mathrm{V}$  rms line and to the ground. As shown in the figure, the neutral line is connected to the ground (the earth) at many critical locations. Although the ground line seems redundant, grounding is important for many reasons. First, it is required by NEC. Second, grounding

provides a convenient path to ground for lightning that strikes the power line. Third, grounds minimize the risk of electric shock. What causes shock is the passage of current from one part of the body to another. The human body is like a big resistor  $R$ . If  $V$  is the potential difference between the body and the ground, the current through the body is determined by Ohm's law as

$$
I = \frac{V}{R} \tag{12.73}
$$

The value of  $R$  varies from person to person and depends on whether the body is wet or dry. How great or how deadly the shock is depends on the amount of current, the pathway of the current through the body, and the length of time the body is exposed to the current. Currents less than  $1\mathrm{mA}$  may not be harmful to the body, but currents greater than  $10\mathrm{mA}$  can cause severe shock. A modern safety device is the ground- fault circuit interrupter (GFCI), used in outdoor circuits and in bathrooms, where the risk of electric shock is greatest. It is essentially a circuit breaker that opens when the sum of the currents  $i_{R}$ ,  $i_{W}$ , and  $i_{B}$  through the red, white, and the black lines is not equal to zero, or  $i_{R} + i_{W} + i_{B} \neq 0$ .

The best way to avoid electric shock is to follow safety guidelines concerning electrical systems and appliances. Here are some of them:

- Never assume that an electrical circuit is dead. Always check to be sure.- Use safety devices when necessary, and wear suitable clothing (insulated shoes, gloves, etc.).- Never use two hands when testing high-voltage circuits, since the current through one hand to the other hand has a direct path through your chest and heart.- Do not touch an electrical appliance when you are wet. Remember that water conducts electricity.- Be extremely careful when working with electronic appliances such as radio and TV because these appliances have large capacitors in them. The capacitors take time to discharge after the power is disconnected.- Always have another person present when working on a wiring system, just in case of an accident.

# 12.11 Summary

1. The phase sequence is the order in which the phase voltages of a three-phase generator occur with respect to time. In an abc sequence of balanced source voltages,  $\mathbf{V}_{an}$  leads  $\mathbf{V}_{bn}$  by  $120^{\circ}$ , which in turn leads  $\mathbf{V}_{cn}$  by  $120^{\circ}$ . In an acb sequence of balanced voltages,  $\mathbf{V}_{an}$  leads  $\mathbf{V}_{cn}$  by  $120^{\circ}$ , which in turn leads  $\mathbf{V}_{bn}$  by  $120^{\circ}$ .

2. A balanced wye- or delta-connected load is one in which the three-phase impedances are equal.

3. The easiest way to analyze a balanced three-phase circuit is to transform both the source and the load to a Y-Y system and then analyze the single-phase equivalent circuit. Table 12.1 presents a summary of the formulas for phase currents and voltages and line currents and voltages for the four possible configurations.

4. The line current  $I_{L}$  is the current flowing from the generator to the load in each transmission line in a three-phase system. The line voltage  $V_{L}$  is the voltage between each pair of lines, excluding the neutral line if it exists. The phase current  $I_{p}$  is the current flowing through each phase in a three-phase load. The phase voltage  $V_{p}$  is the voltage of each phase. For a wye-connected load,

$$
V_{L} = \sqrt{3} V_{p}\qquad \mathrm{and}\qquad I_{L} = I_{p}
$$

For a delta- connected load,

$$
V_{L} = V_{p}\qquad \mathrm{and}\qquad I_{L} = \sqrt{3} I_{p}
$$

5. The total instantaneous power in a balanced three-phase system is constant and equal to the average power.

6. The total complex power absorbed by a balanced three-phase Y-connected or  $\Delta$ -connected load is

$$
\mathbf{S} = P + jQ = \sqrt{3} V_{L}I_{L} / \theta
$$

where  $\theta$  is the angle of the load impedances.

7. An unbalanced three-phase system can be analyzed using nodal or mesh analysis.

8. PSpice is used to analyze three-phase circuits in the same way as it is used for analyzing single-phase circuits.

9. The total real power is measured in three-phase systems using either the three-wattmeter method or the two-wattmeter method.

10. Residential wiring uses a 120/240-V, single-phase, three-wire system.

# Career in Electromagnetics

Electromagnetics (EM) is the branch of electrical engineering (or physics) that deals with the analysis and application of electric and magnetic fields. In electromagnetics, electric circuit analysis is applied at low frequencies.

The principles of EM are applied in various allied disciplines, such as electric machines, electromechanical energy conversion, radar meteorology, remote sensing, satellite communications, bioelectromagnetics, electromagnetic interference and compatibility, plasmas, and fiber optics. EM devices include electric motors and generators, transformers, electromagnets, magnetic levitation, antennas, radars, microwave ovens, microwave dishes, superconductors, and electrocardiograms. The design of these devices requires a thorough knowledge of the laws and principles of EM.

EM is regarded as one of the more difficult disciplines in electrical engineering. One reason is that EM phenomena are rather abstract. But if one enjoys working with mathematics and can visualize the invisible, one should consider being a specialist in EM, inasmuch as few electrical engineers specialize in this area. Electrical engineers who specialize in EM are needed in microwave industries, radio/TV broadcasting stations, electromagnetic research laboratories, and several communications industries.

James Clerk Maxwell (1831- 1879), a graduate in mathematics from Cambridge University, in 1865 wrote a most remarkable paper in which he mathematically unified the laws of Faraday and Ampere. This relationship between the electric field and magnetic field served as the basis for what was later called electromagnetic fields and waves, a major field of study in electrical engineering. The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) uses a graphical representation of this principle in its logo, in which a straight arrow represents current and a curved arrow represents the electromagnetic field. This relationship is commonly known as the right- hand rule. Maxwell was a very active theoretician and scientist. He is best known for the "Maxwell equations." The maxwell, a unit of magnetic flux, was named after him.

# 13.1 Introduction

The circuits we have considered so far may be regarded as conductively coupled, because one loop affects the neighboring loop through current conduction. When two loops with or without contacts between them affect each other through the magnetic field generated by one of them, they are said to be magnetically coupled.

The transformer is an electrical device designed on the basis of the concept of magnetic coupling. It uses magnetically coupled coils to transfer energy from one circuit to another. Transformers are key circuit elements. They are used in power systems for stepping up or stepping down ac voltages or currents. They are used in electronic circuits such as radio and television receivers for such purposes as impedance matching, isolating one part of a circuit from another, and again for stepping up or down ac voltages and currents.

We will begin with the concept of mutual inductance and introduce the dot convention used for determining the voltage polarities of inductively coupled components. Based on the notion of mutual inductance,

we then introduce the circuit element known as the transformer. We will consider the linear transformer, the ideal transformer, the ideal autotransformer, and the three- phase transformer. Finally, among their important applications, we look at transformers as isolating and matching devices and their use in power distribution.

# 13.2 Mutual Inductance

When two inductors (or coils) are in a close proximity to each other, the magnetic flux caused by current in one coil links with the other coil, thereby inducing voltage in the latter. This phenomenon is known as mutual inductance.

Let us first consider a single inductor, a coil with  $N$  turns. When current  $i$  flows through the coil, a magnetic flux  $\phi$  is produced around it (Fig. 13.1). According to Faraday's law, the voltage  $\nu$  induced in the coil is proportional to the number of turns  $N$  and the time rate of change of the magnetic flux  $\phi$ ; that is,

$$
\nu = N\frac{d\phi}{dt} \tag{13.1}
$$

But the flux  $\phi$  is produced by current  $i$  so that any change in  $\phi$  is caused by a change in the current. Hence, Eq. (13.1) can be written as

$$
\nu = N\frac{d\phi}{dt}\frac{di}{dt} \tag{13.2}
$$

or

$$
\nu = L\frac{di}{dt} \tag{13.3}
$$

which is the voltage- current relationship for the inductor. From Eqs. (13.2) and (13.3), the inductance  $L$  of the inductor is thus given by

$$
L = N\frac{d\phi}{di} \tag{13.4}
$$

This inductance is commonly called self- inductance, because it relates the voltage induced in a coil by a time- varying current in the same coil.

Now consider two coils with self- inductances  $L_{1}$  and  $L_{2}$  that are in close proximity with each other (Fig. 13.2). Coil 1 has  $N_{1}$  turns, while coil 2 has  $N_{2}$  turns. For the sake of simplicity, assume that the second inductor carries no current. The magnetic flux  $\phi_{1}$  emanating from coil 1 has two components: One component  $\phi_{11}$  links only coil 1, and another component  $\phi_{12}$  links both coils. Hence,

$$
\phi_{1} = \phi_{11} + \phi_{12} \tag{13.5}
$$

Although the two coils are physically separated, they are said to be magnetically coupled. Since the entire flux  $\phi_{1}$  links coil 1, the voltage induced in coil 1 is

$$
\nu_{1} = N_{1}\frac{d\phi_{1}}{dt} \tag{13.6}
$$

Only flux  $\phi_{12}$  links coil 2, so the voltage induced in coil 2 is

$$
\nu_{2} = N_{2}\frac{d\phi_{12}}{dt} \tag{13.7}
$$

Figure 13.2Mutual inductance  $M_{21}$  of coil 2 with respect to coil 1.

Again, as the fluxes are caused by the current  $i_{1}$  flowing in coil 1, Eq. (13.6) can be written as

$$
\nu_{1} = N_{1}\frac{d\phi_{1}}{d i_{1}}\frac{d i_{1}}{d t} = L_{1}\frac{d i_{1}}{d t} \tag{13.8}
$$

where  $L_{1} = N_{1}d\phi_{1} / d i_{1}$  is the self- inductance of coil 1. Similarly, Eq. (13.7) can be written as

$$
\nu_{2} = N_{2}\frac{d\phi_{12}}{d i_{1}}\frac{d i_{1}}{d t} = M_{21}\frac{d i_{1}}{d t} \tag{13.9}
$$

where

$$
M_{21} = N_{2}\frac{d\phi_{12}}{d i_{1}} \tag{13.10}
$$

$M_{21}$  is known as the mutual inductance of coil 2 with respect to coil 1. Subscript 21 indicates that the inductance  $M_{21}$  relates the voltage induced in coil 2 to the current in coil 1. Thus, the open- circuit mutual voltage (or induced voltage) across coil 2 is

$$
\nu_{2} = M_{21}\frac{d i_{1}}{d t} \tag{13.11}
$$

Figure 13.3 Mutual inductance  $M_{12}$  of coil 1 with respect to coil 2.

Suppose we now let current  $i_{2}$  flow in coil 2, while coil 1 carries no current (Fig. 13.3). The magnetic flux  $\phi_{2}$  emanating from coil 2 comprises flux  $\phi_{22}$  that links only coil 2 and flux  $\phi_{21}$  that links both coils. Hence,

$$
\phi_{2} = \phi_{21} + \phi_{22} \tag{13.12}
$$

The entire flux  $\phi_{2}$  links coil 2, so the voltage induced in coil 2 is

$$
\nu_{2} = N_{2}\frac{d\phi_{2}}{d t} = N_{2}\frac{d\phi_{2}}{d i_{2}}\frac{d i_{2}}{d t} = L_{2}\frac{d i_{2}}{d t} \tag{13.13}
$$

where  $L_{2} = N_{2}d\phi_{2} / d i_{2}$  is the self- inductance of coil 2. Since only flux  $\phi_{21}$  links coil 1, the voltage induced in coil 1 is

$$
\nu_{1} = N_{1}\frac{d\phi_{21}}{d t} = N_{1}\frac{d\phi_{21}}{d i_{2}}\frac{d i_{2}}{d t} = M_{12}\frac{d i_{2}}{d t} \tag{13.14}
$$

where

$$
M_{12} = N_{1}\frac{d\phi_{21}}{d i_{2}} \tag{13.15}
$$

which is the mutual inductance of coil 1 with respect to coil 2. Thus, the open- circuit mutual voltage across coil 1 is

$$
\nu_{1} = M_{12}\frac{d i_{2}}{d t} \tag{13.16}
$$

We will see in the next section that  $M_{12}$  and  $M_{21}$  are equal; that is,

$$
M_{12} = M_{21} = M \tag{13.17}
$$

and we refer to  $M$  as the mutual inductance between the two coils. Like self- inductance  $L$ , mutual inductance  $M$  is measured in henrys (H). Keep in mind that mutual coupling only exists when the inductors or coils are in close proximity, and the circuits are driven by time- varying sources. We recall that inductors act like short circuits to dc.

From the two cases in Figs. 13.2 and 13.3, we conclude that mutual inductance results if a voltage is induced by a time- varying current in another circuit. It is the property of an inductor to produce a voltage in reaction to a time- varying current in another inductor near it. Thus,

Mutual inductance is the ability of one inductor to induce a voltage across a neighboring inductor, measured in henrys (H).

Although mutual inductance  $M$  is always a positive quantity, the mutual voltage  $M\mathrm{di} / \mathrm{dt}$  may be negative or positive, just like the self- induced voltage  $L\mathrm{di} / \mathrm{dt}$ . However, unlike the self- induced  $L\mathrm{di} / \mathrm{dt}$ , whose polarity is determined by the reference direction of the current and the reference polarity of the voltage (according to the passive sign convention), the polarity of mutual voltage  $M\mathrm{di} / \mathrm{dt}$  is not easy to determine, because four terminals are involved. The choice of the correct polarity for  $M\mathrm{di} / \mathrm{dt}$  is made by examining the orientation or particular way in which both coils are physically wound and applying Lenz's law in conjunction with the right- hand rule. Since it is inconvenient to show the construction details of coils on a circuit schematic, we apply the dot convention in circuit analysis. By this convention, a dot is placed in the circuit at one end of each of the two magnetically coupled coils to indicate the direction of the magnetic flux if current enters that dotted terminal of the coil. This is illustrated in Fig. 13.4. Given a circuit, the dots are already placed beside the coils so that we need not bother about how to place them. The dots are used along with the dot convention to determine the polarity of the mutual voltage. The dot convention is stated as follows:

If a current enters the dotted terminal of one coil, the reference polarity of the mutual voltage in the second coil is positive at the dotted terminal of the second coil.

Alternatively,

If a current leaves the dotted terminal of one coil, the reference polarity of the mutual voltage in the second coil is negative at the dotted terminal of the second coil.

Thus, the reference polarity of the mutual voltage depends on the reference direction of the inducing current and the dots on the coupled coils. Application of the dot convention is illustrated in the four pairs of mutually coupled coils in Fig. 13.5. For the coupled coils in Fig. 13.5(a), the sign of the mutual voltage  $\nu_{2}$  is determined by the reference polarity for  $\nu_{2}$  and the direction of  $i_{1}$ . Since  $i_{1}$  enters the dotted terminal of coil 1 and  $\nu_{2}$  is positive at the dotted terminal of coil 2, the mutual voltage is  $+M\mathrm{di}_{1} / \mathrm{dt}$ . For the coils in Fig. 13.5(b), the current  $i_{1}$  enters

Figure 13.6Dot convention for coils in series; the sign indicates the polarity of the mutual voltage: (a) series-aiding connection, (b) series-opposing connection.

the dotted terminal of coil 1 and  $\nu_{2}$  is negative at the dotted terminal of coil 2. Hence, the mutual voltage is  $- M d i_{1} / d t$  . The same reasoning applies to the coils in Figs. 13.5(c) and 13.5(d).

Figure 13.6 shows the dot convention for coupled coils in series. For the coils in Fig. 13.6(a), the total inductance is

$$
L = L_{1} + L_{2} + 2M \tag{13.18}
$$

For the coils in Fig. 13.6(b),

$$
L = L_{1} + L_{2} - 2M \tag{13.19}
$$

Now that we know how to determine the polarity of the mutual voltage, we are prepared to analyze circuits involving mutual inductance. As the first example, consider the circuit in Fig. 13.7(a). Applying KVL to coil 1 gives

$$
\nu_{1} = i_{1}R_{1} + L_{1}\frac{d i_{1}}{d t} +M\frac{d i_{2}}{d t} \tag{13.20a}
$$

For coil 2, KVL gives

$$
\nu_{2} = i_{2}R_{2} + L_{2}\frac{d i_{2}}{d t} +M\frac{d i_{1}}{d t} \tag{13.20b}
$$

We can write Eq. (13.20) in the frequency domain as

$$
\begin{array}{r}\mathbf{V}_{1} = (R_{1} + j\omega L_{1})\mathbf{I}_{1} + j\omega M\mathbf{I}_{2}\\ \mathbf{V}_{2} = j\omega M\mathbf{I}_{1} + (R_{2} + j\omega L_{2})\mathbf{I}_{2} \end{array} \tag{13.21b}
$$

As a second example, consider the circuit in Fig. 13.7(b). We analyze this in the frequency domain. Applying KVL to coil 1, we get

$$
\mathbf{V} = (\mathbf{Z}_{1} + j\omega L_{1})\mathbf{I}_{1} - j\omega M\mathbf{I}_{2} \tag{13.22a}
$$

For coil 2, KVL yields

$$
0 = -j\omega M\mathbf{I}_{1} + (\mathbf{Z}_{L} + j\omega L_{2})\mathbf{I}_{2} \tag{13.22b}
$$

Equations (13.21) and (13.22) are solved in the usual manner to determine the currents.

One of the most important things in making sure one solves problems accurately is to be able to check each step during the solution process and to make sure assumptions can be verified. Too often, solving mutually coupled circuits requires the problem solver to track two or more steps made at once regarding the sign and values of the mutually induced voltages.

Figure 13.8Model that makes analysis of mutually coupled easier to solve.

Experience has shown that if we break the problem into steps of solving for the value and the sign into separate steps, the decisions made are easier to track. We suggest that model (Figure 13.8 (b)) be used when analyzing circuits containing a mutually coupled circuit shown in Figure 13.8(a):

Notice that we have not included the signs in the model. The reason for that is that we first determine the value of the induced voltages and then we determine the appropriate signs. Clearly,  $\mathrm{I}_{1}$  induces a voltage within the second coil represented by the value  $j\omega \mathrm{I}_{1}$  and  $\mathrm{I}_{2}$  induces a voltage of  $j\omega \mathrm{I}_{2}$  in the first coil. Once we have the values we next use both circuits to find the correct signs for the dependent sources as shown in Figure 13.8(c).

Since  $\mathrm{I}_{1}$  enters  $L_{1}$  at the dotted end, it induces a voltage in  $L_{2}$  that tries to force a current out of the dotted end of  $L_{2}$  which means that the source must have a plus on top and a minus on the bottom as shown in Figure 13.8(c).  $\mathrm{I}_{2}$  leaves the dotted end of  $L_{2}$  which means that it induces a voltage in  $L_{1}$  which tries to force a current into the dotted end of  $L_{1}$  requiring a dependent source that has a plus on the bottom and a minus on top as shown in Figure 13.8(c). Now all we have to do is to analyze a circuit with two dependent sources. This process allows you to check each of your assumptions.

At this introductory level we are not concerned with the determination of the mutual inductances of the coils and their dot placements. Like  $R$ ,  $L$ , and  $C$ , calculation of  $M$  would involve applying the theory of electromagnetics to the actual physical properties of the coils. In this text, we assume that the mutual inductance and the placement of the dots are the "givens" of the circuit problem, like the circuit components  $R$ ,  $L$ , and  $C$ .

$$

or

$$
j\mathbf{I}_{1} - j3\mathbf{I}_{2} = 12 \tag{13.1.1}
$$

For loop 2, KVL gives

$$
-j3\mathbf{I}_{1} + (12 + j6)\mathbf{I}_{2} = 0

or

$$
\mathbf{I}_{1} = \frac{(12 + j6)\mathbf{I}_{2}}{j3} = (2 - j4)\mathbf{I}_{2} \tag{13.1.2}
$$

Substituting this in Eq. (13.1.1), we get

$$
(j2 + 4 - j3)\mathbf{I}_{2} = (4 - j)\mathbf{I}_{2} = 12
$$

or

$$
\mathbf{I}_{2} = \frac{12}{4 - j} = 2.91\big / 14.04^{\circ}\mathrm{A} \tag{13.1.3}

From Eqs. (13.1.2) and (13.1.3),

$$

# Solution:

The key to analyzing a magnetically coupled circuit is knowing the polarity of the mutual voltage. We need to apply the dot rule. In Fig. 13.11, suppose coil 1 is the one whose reactance is  $6\Omega$ , and coil 2 is the one whose reactance is  $8\Omega$ . To figure out the polarity of the mutual voltage in coil 1 due to current  $\mathbf{I}_{2}$ , we observe that  $\mathbf{I}_{2}$  leaves the dotted terminal of coil 2. Since we are applying KVL in the clockwise direction, it implies that the mutual voltage is negative, that is,  $- j2\mathbf{I}_{2}$ .

Alternatively, it might be best to figure out the mutual voltage by redrawing the relevant portion of the circuit, as shown in Fig. 13.12, where it becomes clear that the mutual voltage is  $\mathbf{V}_{1} = - 2j \mathbf{I}_{2}$ .Thus, for mesh 1 in Fig. 13.11, KVL gives

Thus, for mesh 1 in Fig.13.11,KVL gives

$$
-100 + \mathbf{I}_{1}(4 - j3 + j6) - j6\mathbf{I}_{2} - j2\mathbf{I}_{2} = 0
$$

or

$$
100 = (4 + j3)\mathbf{I}_{1} - j8\mathbf{I}_{2} \tag{13.2.1}
$$

Similarly, to figure out the mutual voltage in coil 2 due to current  $\mathbf{I}_{1}$  consider the relevant portion of the circuit, as shown in Fig. 13.12. Applying the dot convention gives the mutual voltage as  $\mathbf{V}_{2} = - 2j\mathbf{I}_{1}$  . Also, current  $\mathbf{I}_{2}$  sees the two coupled coils in series in Fig. 13.11; since it leaves the dotted terminals in both coils, Eq. (13.18) applies. Therefore, for mesh 2 in Fig. 13.11, KVL gives

$$
0 = -2j\mathbf{I}_{1} - j6\mathbf{I}_{1} + (j6 + j8 + j2\times 2 + 5)\mathbf{I}_{2}
$$

or

$$
0 = -j8\mathbf{I}_{1} + (5 + j18)\mathbf{I}_{2} \tag{13.2.2}
$$

Putting Eqs. (13.2.1) and (13.2.2) in matrix form, we get

$$
{\left[\begin{array}{l}{100}\\ {0}\end{array}\right]}={\left[\begin{array}{l l}{4+j3}&{\ -j8}\\ {-j8}&{5+j18}\end{array}\right]}{\left[\begin{array}{l}{\mathbf{I}_{1}}\\ {\mathbf{I}_{2}}\end{array}\right]}
$$

The determinants are

$$
\begin{array}{r l} & {\Delta = \left| \begin{array}{c c}{4 + j3} & {-j8}\\ {-j8} & {5 + j18} \end{array} \right| = 30 + j87}\\ & {\Delta_{1} = \left| \begin{array}{c c}{100} & {-j8}\\ {0} & {5 + j18} \end{array} \right| = 100(5 + j18)}\\ & {\Delta_{2} = \left| \begin{array}{c c}{4 + j3} & {100}\\ {-j8} & {0} \end{array} \right| = j800} \end{array}
$$

Thus, we obtain the mesh currents as

$$
\mathbf{I}_{1} = \frac{\Delta_{1}}{\Delta} = \frac{100(5 + j18)}{30 + j87} = \frac{1,868.2 / 74.5^{\circ}}{92.03 / 71^{\circ}} = 20.3 / 3.5^{\circ}\mathrm{~A~}
$$

$$
\mathbf{I}_{2} = \frac{\Delta_{2}}{\Delta} = \frac{j800}{30 + j87} = \frac{800 / 90^{\circ}}{92.03 / 71^{\circ}} = 8.693 / 19^{\circ}\mathrm{~A~}
$$

# 13.3 Energy in a Coupled Circuit

In Chapter 6, we saw that the energy stored in an inductor is given by

$$
w = \frac{1}{2} L i^{2} \tag{13.23}
$$

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-14/63c420e9-9220-47ad-935a-09e6b2aeb2a8/1a825687f06ad35a5296a9dd612d7bf87301bef4367b54c607249f3f19702db1.jpg)  
Figure 13.14 The circuit for deriving energy stored in a coupled circuit.

We now want to determine the energy stored in magnetically coupled coils.

Consider the circuit in Fig. 13.14. We assume that currents  $i_{1}$  and  $i_{2}$  are zero initially, so that the energy stored in the coils is zero. If we let  $i_{1}$  increase from zero to  $I_{1}$  while maintaining  $i_{2} = 0$ , the power in coil 1 is

$$
p_{1}(t) = \nu_{1}i_{1} = i_{1}L_{1}\frac{d i_{1}}{d t} \tag{13.24}
$$

and the energy stored in the circuit is

$$
w_{1} = \int p_{1}d t = L_{1}\int_{0}^{I_{1}}i_{1}d i_{1} = \frac{1}{2} L_{1}I_{1}^{2} \tag{13.25}
$$

If we now maintain  $i_{1} = I_{1}$  and increase  $i_{2}$  from zero to  $I_{2}$ , the mutual voltage induced in coil 1 is  $M_{12}d i_{2} / d t$ , while the mutual voltage induced in coil 2 is zero, since  $i_{1}$  does not change. The power in the coils is now

$$
p_{2}(t) = i_{1}M_{12}\frac{d i_{2}}{d t} +i_{2}\nu_{2} = I_{1}M_{12}\frac{d i_{2}}{d t} +i_{2}L_{2}\frac{d i_{2}}{d t} \tag{13.26}
$$

and the energy stored in the circuit is

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{w_{2}=\int p_{2}d t=M_{12}I_{1}\int_{0}^{I_{2}}d i_{2}+L_{2}\int_{0}^{I_{2}}i_{2}d i_{2}}}\\ {{=M_{12}I_{1}I_{2}+\frac{1}{2}L_{2}I_{2}^{2}}}\end{array} \tag{13.27}
$$

The total energy stored in the coils when both  $i_{1}$  and  $i_{2}$  have reached constant values is

$$
w = w_{1} + w_{2} = \frac{1}{2} L_{1}I_{1}^{2} + \frac{1}{2} L_{2}I_{2}^{2} + M_{12}I_{1}I_{2} \tag{13.28}
$$

If we reverse the order by which the currents reach their final values, that is, if we first increase  $i_{2}$  from zero to  $I_{2}$  and later increase  $i_{1}$  from zero to  $I_{1}$ , the total energy stored in the coils is

$$
w = \frac{1}{2} L_{1}I_{1}^{2} + \frac{1}{2} L_{2}I_{2}^{2} + M_{21}I_{1}I_{2} \tag{13.29}
$$

Because the total energy stored should be the same regardless of how we reach the final conditions, comparing Eqs. (13.28) and (13.29) leads us to conclude that

$$
M_{12} = M_{21} = M \tag{13.30a}
$$

and

$$
w = \frac{1}{2} L_{1}I_{1}^{2} + \frac{1}{2} L_{2}I_{2}^{2} + M I_{1}I_{2} \tag{13.30b}
$$

This equation was derived based on the assumption that the coil currents both entered the dotted terminals. If one current enters one dotted

terminal while the other current leaves the other dotted terminal, the mutual voltage is negative, so that the mutual energy  $MI_{1}I_{2}$  is also negative. In that case,

$$
w = \frac{1}{2} L_{1}I_{1}^{2} + \frac{1}{2} L_{2}I_{2}^{2} - MI_{1}I_{2} \tag{13.31}
$$

Also, because  $I_{1}$  and  $I_{2}$  are arbitrary values, they may be replaced by  $i_{1}$  and  $i_{2}$ , which gives the instantaneous energy stored in the circuit the general expression

$$
w = \frac{1}{2} L_{1}i_{1}^{2} + \frac{1}{2} L_{2}i_{2}^{2}\pm Mi_{1}i_{2} \tag{13.32}
$$

The positive sign is selected for the mutual term if both currents enter or leave the dotted terminals of the coils; the negative sign is selected otherwise.

We will now establish an upper limit for the mutual inductance M. The energy stored in the circuit cannot be negative because the circuit is passive. This means that the quantity  $1 / 2L_{1}i_{1}^{2} + 1 / 2L_{2}i_{2}^{2} - Mi_{1}i_{2}$  must be greater than or equal to zero:

$$
\frac{1}{2} L_{1}i_{1}^{2} + \frac{1}{2} L_{2}i_{2}^{2} - Mi_{1}i_{2}\geq 0 \tag{13.33}
$$

To complete the square, we both add and subtract the term  $i_{1}i_{2}(\sqrt{L_{1}L_{2}}$  on the right- hand side of Eq. (13.33) and obtain

$$
\frac{1}{2} (i_{1}\sqrt{L_{1}} -i_{2}\sqrt{L_{2}})^{2} + i_{1}i_{2}(\sqrt{L_{1}L_{2}} -M)\geq 0 \tag{13.34}
$$

The squared term is never negative; at its least it is zero. Therefore, the second term on the right- hand side of Eq. (13.34) must be greater than zero; that is,

$$
\sqrt{L_{1}L_{2}} -M\geq 0
$$

or

$$
M\leq \sqrt{L_{1}L_{2}} \tag{13.35}
$$

Thus, the mutual inductance cannot be greater than the geometric mean of the self- inductances of the coils. The extent to which the mutual inductance  $M$  approaches the upper limit is specified by the coefficient of coupling  $k$ , given by

$$
k = \frac{M}{\sqrt{L_{1}L_{2}}} \tag{13.36}
$$

or

$$
M = k\sqrt{L_{1}L_{2}} \tag{13.37}
$$

where  $0\leq k\leq 1$  or equivalently  $0\leq M\leq \sqrt{L_{1}L_{2}}$ . The coupling coefficient is the fraction of the total flux emanating from one coil that links the other coil. For example, in Fig. 13.2,

$$
k = \frac{\phi_{12}}{\phi_{1}} = \frac{\phi_{12}}{\phi_{11} + \phi_{12}} \tag{13.38}
$$

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-14/63c420e9-9220-47ad-935a-09e6b2aeb2a8/ea3e72b693a2540b2c95caed95ac9fb5e2e510d9eff1a804ba12b4958b4a334b.jpg)  
Figure 13.15 Windings: (a) loosely coupled, (b) tightly coupled; cutaway view demonstrates both windings.

and in Fig. 13.3,

$$
k = \frac{\phi_{21}}{\phi_{2}} = \frac{\phi_{21}}{\phi_{21} + \phi_{22}} \tag{13.39}
$$

If the entire flux produced by one coil links another coil, then  $k = 1$  and we have 100 percent coupling, or the coils are said to be perfectly coupled. For  $k < 0.5$ , coils are said to be loosely coupled, and for  $k > 0.5$ , they are said to be tightly coupled. Thus,

The coupling coefficient  $k$  is a measure of the magnetic coupling between two coils;  $0 \leq k \leq 1$ .

We expect  $k$  to depend on the closeness of the two coils, their core, their orientation, and their windings. Figure 13.15 shows loosely coupled windings and tightly coupled windings. The air- core transformers used in radio frequency circuits are loosely coupled, whereas iron- core transformers used in power systems are tightly coupled. The linear transformers discussed in Section 3.4 are mostly air- core; the ideal transformers discussed in Sections 13.5 and 13.6 are principally iron- core.

# Example 13.3

Figure 13.16 For Example 13.3.

Consider the circuit in Fig. 13.16. Determine the coupling coefficient. Calculate the energy stored in the coupled inductors at time  $t = 1$  s if  $\nu = 60 \cos (4t + 30^{\circ})$  V.

# Solution:

The coupling coefficient is

$$
k = \frac{M}{\sqrt{L_1L_2}} = \frac{2.5}{\sqrt{20}} = 0.56
$$

indicating that the inductors are tightly coupled. To find the energy stored, we need to calculate the current. To find the current, we need to obtain the frequency- domain equivalent of the circuit.

$$
\begin{array}{r l r l}{{60\cos(4t+30^{\circ})}}&{{\Rightarrow}}&{{60\big/30^{\circ},\omega=4\mathrm{rad/s}}}\\ {{5\mathrm{~H}}}&{{\Rightarrow}}&{{j\omega L_{1}=j20\Omega}}\\ {{2.5\mathrm{~H}}}&{{\Rightarrow}}&{{j\omega M=j10\Omega}}\\ {{4\mathrm{~H}}}&{{\Rightarrow}}&{{j\omega L_{2}=j16\Omega}}\\ {{\frac{1}{16}\mathrm{~F}}}&{{\Rightarrow}}&{{\frac{1}{j\omega C}=-j4\Omega}}\end{array}
$$

The frequency- domain equivalent is shown in Fig. 13.17. We now apply mesh analysis. For mesh 1,

$$
(10 + j20)\mathbf{I}_1 + j10\mathbf{I}_2 = 60\big / 30^\circ \tag{13.3.1}
$$

For mesh 2,

$$
j10\mathbf{I}_1 + (j16 - j4)\mathbf{I}_2 = 0
$$

or

$$
\mathbf{I}_1 = -1.2\mathbf{I}_2 \tag{13.3.2}
$$

Substituting this into Eq. (13.3.1) yields

$$
\mathbf{I}_{2}(-12 - j14) = 60\big / 30^{\circ}\qquad \Rightarrow \qquad \mathbf{I}_{2} = 3.254\big / 160.6^{\circ}\mathrm{~A~}
$$

and

$$
\mathbf{I}_{1} = -1.2\mathbf{I}_{2} = 3.905\big / - 19.4^{\circ}\mathrm{~A~}
$$

In the time- domain,

$$
i_{1} = 3.905\cos (4t - 19.4^{\circ}),\qquad i_{2} = 3.254\cos (4t + 160.6^{\circ})
$$

At time  $t = 1$  s,  $4t = 4$  rad  $= 229.2^{\circ}$  ,and

$$
\begin{array}{r}{i_{1} = 3.905\cos (229.2^{\circ} - 19.4^{\circ}) = -3.389\mathrm{~A~}}\\ {i_{2} = 3.254\cos (229.2^{\circ} + 160.6^{\circ}) = 2.824\mathrm{~A~}} \end{array}
$$

The total energy stored in the coupled inductors is

$$
\begin{array}{l}{{w=\frac{1}{2}L_{1}i_{1}^{2}+\frac{1}{2}L_{2}i_{2}^{2}+M i_{1}i_{2}}}\\ {{=\frac{1}{2}(5)(-3.389)^{2}+\frac{1}{2}(4)(2.824)^{2}+2.5(-3.389)(2.824)=20.73\mathrm{~J}}}\end{array}

# 13.4 Linear Transformers

Here we introduce the transformer as a new circuit element. A transformer is a magnetic device that takes advantage of the phenomenon of mutual inductance.

A transformer is generally a four- terminal device comprising two (or more) magnetically coupled coils.

A linear transformer may also be regarded as one whose flux is proportional to the currents in its windings.

As shown in Fig. 13.19, the coil that is directly connected to the voltage source is called the primary winding. The coil connected to the load is called the secondary winding. The resistances  $R_{1}$  and  $R_{2}$  are included to account for the losses (power dissipation) in the coils. The transformer is said to be linear if the coils are wound on a magnetically linear material—a material for which the magnetic permeability is constant. Such materials include air, plastic, Bakelite, and wood. In fact, most materials are magnetically linear. Linear transformers are sometimes called air- core transformers, although not all of them are necessarily air- core. They are used in radio and TV sets. Figure 13.20 portrays different types of transformers.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-14/63c420e9-9220-47ad-935a-09e6b2aeb2a8/860a17c8db698407e1e83d1d656fa5a11c7b12aca3145e87a70220df7d4cc06a.jpg)

Figure 13.20 Different types of transformers: (a) a large substation transformer, (b) audio transformers. (a) James Watson, (b) Jensen Transformers, Inc., Chatsworth, CA

We would like to obtain the input impedance  $\mathbf{Z}_{\mathrm{in}}$  as seen from the source, because  $\mathbf{Z}_{\mathrm{in}}$  governs the behavior of the primary circuit. Applying KVL to the two meshes in Fig. 13.19 gives

$$
\begin{array}{r}\mathbf{V} = (R_1 + j\omega L_1)\mathbf{I}_1 - j\omega M\mathbf{I}_2\\ 0 = -j\omega M\mathbf{I}_1 + (R_2 + j\omega L_2 + \mathbf{Z}_L)\mathbf{I}_2 \end{array} \tag{13.40b}
$$

In Eq. (13.40b), we express  $\mathbf{I}_2$  in terms of  $\mathbf{I}_1$  and substitute it into Eq. (13.40a). We get the input impedance as

$$
\mathbf{Z}_{\mathrm{in}} = \frac{\mathbf{V}}{\mathbf{I}_1} = R_1 + j\omega L_1 + \frac{\omega^2M^2}{R_2 + j\omega L_2 + \mathbf{Z}_L} \tag{13.41}
$$

Notice that the input impedance comprises two terms. The first term,  $(R_{1} + j\omega L_{1})$ , is the primary impedance. The second term is due to the coupling between the primary and secondary windings. It is as though this impedance is reflected to the primary. Thus, it is known as the reflected impedance  $\mathbf{Z}_{R}$ , and

$$
\mathbf{Z}_R = \frac{\omega^2M^2}{R_2 + j\omega L_2 + \mathbf{Z}_L} \tag{13.42}
$$

It should be noted that the result in Eq. (13.41) or (13.42) is not affected by the location of the dots on the transformer, because the same result is produced when  $M$  is replaced by  $- M$ .

The little bit of experience gained in Sections 13.2 and 13.3 in analyzing magnetically coupled circuits is enough to convince anyone that analyzing these circuits is not as easy as circuits in previous chapters. For this reason, it is sometimes convenient to replace a magnetically coupled circuit by an equivalent circuit with no magnetic coupling. We want to replace the linear transformer in Fig. 13.21 by an equivalent T or  $\Pi$  circuit, a circuit that would have no mutual inductance.

The voltage- current relationships for the primary and secondary coils give the matrix equation

$$
\begin{array}{r}\left[ \begin{array}{l}\mathbf{V}_1\\ \mathbf{V}_2 \end{array} \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{ll}j\omega L_1 & j\omega M\\ j\omega M & j\omega L_2 \end{array} \right]\left[ \begin{array}{l}\mathbf{I}_1\\ \mathbf{I}_2 \end{array} \right] \end{array} \tag{13.43}
$$

By matrix inversion, this can be written as

$$
\left[ \begin{array}{l}\mathbf{I}_1\\ \mathbf{I}_2 \end{array} \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{ll}\frac{L_2}{j\omega(L_1L_2 - M^2)} & \frac{-M}{j\omega(L_1L_2 - M^2)}\\ \frac{-M}{j\omega(L_1L_2 - M^2)} & \frac{L_1}{j\omega(L_1L_2 - M^2)} \end{array} \right]\left[ \begin{array}{l}\mathbf{V}_1\\ \mathbf{V}_2 \end{array} \right] \tag{13.44}
$$

Our goal is to match Eqs. (13.43) and (13.44) with the corresponding equations for the T and  $\Pi$  networks.

For the T (or Y) network of Fig. 13.22, mesh analysis provides the terminal equations as

$$
\left[ \begin{array}{c}\mathbf{V}_1\\ \mathbf{V}_2 \end{array} \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{cc}j\omega (L_a + L_c) & j\omega L_c\\ j\omega L_c & j\omega (L_b + L_c) \end{array} \right]\left[ \begin{array}{c}\mathbf{I}_1\\ \mathbf{I}_2 \end{array} \right] \tag{13.45}
$$

Some authors call this the coupled impedance.

Figure 13.23 An equivalent  $\Pi$  circuit.

If the circuits in Figs. 13.21 and 13.22 are equivalents, Eqs. (13.43) and (13.45) must be identical. Equating terms in the impedance matrices of Eqs. (13.43) and (13.45) leads to

$$
L_{a} = L_{1} - M,\qquad L_{b} = L_{2} - M,\qquad L_{c} = M \tag{13.46}
$$

For the  $\Pi$  (or  $\Delta$ ) network in Fig. 13.23, nodal analysis gives the terminal equations as

$$
\left[ \begin{array}{c}{\mathbf{I}_{1}}\\ {\mathbf{I}_{2}} \end{array} \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{c c}{\frac{1}{j\omega L_{A}} +\frac{1}{j\omega L_{C}}} & {-\frac{1}{j\omega L_{C}}}\\ {-\frac{1}{j\omega L_{C}}} & {\frac{1}{j\omega L_{B}} +\frac{1}{j\omega L_{C}}} \end{array} \right]\left[ \begin{array}{c}{\mathbf{V}_{1}}\\ {\mathbf{V}_{2}} \end{array} \right] \tag{13.47}
$$

Equating terms in admittance matrices of Eqs. (13.44) and (13.47), we obtain

$$

$$

Note that in Figs. 13.22 and 13.23, the inductors are not magnetically coupled. Also note that changing the locations of the dots in Fig. 13.21 can cause  $M$  to become  $- M$ . As Example 13.6 illustrates, a negative value of  $M$  is physically unrealizable but the equivalent model is still mathematically valid.

In the circuit of Fig. 13.24, calculate the input impedance and current  $\mathbf{I}_{1}$ . Take  $\mathbf{Z}_{1} = 60 - j100\Omega$ ,  $\mathbf{Z}_{2} = 30 + j40\Omega$ , and  $\mathbf{Z}_{L} = 80 + j60\Omega$ .

Figure 13.24 For Example 13.4.

# Solution:

From Eq. (13.41),

$$
\begin{array}{l}{{\bf Z}_{\mathrm{in}} = {\bf Z}_{1} + j20 + \frac{(5)^{2}}{j40 + {\bf Z}_{2} + {\bf Z}_{L}}}\\ {= 60 - j100 + j20 + \frac{25}{110 + j140}}\\ {= 60 - j80 + 0.14\underline{{-51.84^{\circ}}}}\\ {= 60.09 - j80.11 = 100.14\underline{{-53.1^{\circ}}}\Omega} \end{array}
$$

Thus,

$$
\mathbf{I}_1 = \frac{\mathbf{V}}{\mathbf{Z}_{\mathrm{in}}} = \frac{50 / 60^\circ}{100.14 / - 53.1^\circ} = 0.5\big / 113.1^\circ \mathrm{A}
$$

Answer: 8.58/58.05° Ω, 4.662/- 58.05° A.

Determine the T- equivalent circuit of the linear transformer in Fig. 13.26(a).

Figure 13.26 For Example 13.5: (a) a linear transformer, (b) its T-equivalent circuit.

# Solution:

Given that  $L_{1} = 10$ ,  $L_{2} = 4$ , and  $M = 2$ , the T- equivalent network has the following parameters:

$$
\begin{array}{c}L_{a} = L_{1} - M = 10 - 2 = 8\mathrm{~H~}\\ L_{b} = L_{2} - M = 4 - 2 = 2\mathrm{~H},\qquad L_{c} = M = 2\mathrm{~H~} \end{array}
$$

The T- equivalent circuit is shown in Fig. 13.26(b). We have assumed that reference directions for currents and voltage polarities in the primary and secondary windings conform to those in Fig. 13.21. Otherwise, we may need to replace  $M$  with  $- M$ , as Example 13.6 illustrates.

# Practice Problem 13.5

For the linear transformer in Fig. 13.26(a), find the  $\Pi$  equivalent network.

Answer:  $L_{A} = 18 \mathrm{H}$ ,  $L_{B} = 4.5 \mathrm{H}$ ,  $L_{C} = 18 \mathrm{H}$ .

# Example 13.6

Solve for  $\mathbf{I}_{1}$ ,  $\mathbf{I}_{2}$ , and  $\mathbf{V}_{o}$  in Fig. 13.27 (the same circuit as for Practice Prob. 13.1) using the T- equivalent circuit for the linear transformer.

Figure 13.28 For Example 13.6: (a) circuit for coupled coils of Fig. 13.27, (b) T-equivalent circuit.

# Solution:

Notice that the circuit in Fig. 13.27 is the same as that in Fig. 13.10 except that the reference direction for current  $\mathbf{I}_{2}$  has been reversed, just to make the reference directions for the currents for the magnetically coupled coils conform with those in Fig. 13.21.

We need to replace the magnetically coupled coils with the T- equivalent circuit. The relevant portion of the circuit in Fig. 13.27 is shown in Fig. 13.28(a). Comparing Fig. 13.28(a) with Fig. 13.21 shows that there are two differences. First, due to the current reference directions and voltage polarities, we need to replace  $M$  by  $- M$  to make Fig. 13.28(a) conform with Fig. 13.21. Second, the circuit in Fig. 13.21 is in the time- domain, whereas the circuit in Fig. 13.28(a) is in the frequency- domain. The difference is the factor  $j\omega$ ; that is,  $L$  in Fig. 13.21 has been replaced with  $j\omega L$  and  $M$  with  $j\omega M$ . Since  $\omega$  is not specified, we can assume  $\omega = 1$  rad/s or any other value; it really does not matter. With these two differences in mind,

$$
L_{a} = L_{1} - (-M) = 8 + 1 = 9 \mathrm{H}
$$

$$
L_{b} = L_{2} - (-M) = 5 + 1 = 6 \mathrm{H}, \qquad L_{c} = -M = -1 \mathrm{H}
$$

Thus, the T- equivalent circuit for the coupled coils is as shown in Fig. 13.28(b).

Inserting the T- equivalent circuit in Fig. 13.28(b) to replace the two coils in Fig. 13.27 gives the equivalent circuit in Fig. 13.29, which can be solved using nodal or mesh analysis. Applying mesh analysis, we obtain

$$
j6 = \mathbf{I}_{1}(4 + j9 - j1) + \mathbf{I}_{2}(-j1) \tag{13.6.1}
$$

and

$$
0 = \mathbf{I}_{1}(-j1) + \mathbf{I}_{2}(10 + j6 - j1) \tag{13.6.2}
$$

From Eq. (13.6.2),

$$
\mathbf{I}_{1} = \frac{(10 + j5)}{j} \mathbf{I}_{2} = (5 - j10) \mathbf{I}_{2} \tag{13.6.3}
$$

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-14/63c420e9-9220-47ad-935a-09e6b2aeb2a8/95a564fd45f829ccb7e5455215c3205891aba8e51efb8f4a2377cbb24b686608.jpg)  
Figure 13.29 For Example 13.6.

Substituting Eq. (13.6.3) into Eq. (13.6.1) gives

$$
j6 = (4 + j8)(5 - j10)\mathbf{I}_{2} - j\mathbf{I}_{2} = (100 - j)\mathbf{I}_{2}\simeq 100\mathbf{I}_{2}
$$

Since 100 is very large compared with 1, the imaginary part of  $(100 - j)$  can be ignored so that  $100 - j\simeq 100$ . Hence,

$$
\mathbf{I}_{2} = \frac{j6}{100} = j0.06 = 0.06\underline{{90^{\circ}}}\mathrm{~A~}
$$

From Eq. (13.6.3),

$$
\mathbf{I}_{1} = (5 - j10)j0.06 = 0.6 + j0.3\mathrm{~A~}
$$

and

$$
\mathbf{V}_{o} = -10\mathbf{I}_{2} = -j0.6 = 0.6\underline{{-90^{\circ}}}\mathrm{~V~}
$$

This agrees with the answer to Practice Prob. 13.1. Of course, the direction of  $\mathbf{I}_{2}$  in Fig. 13.10 is opposite to that in Fig. 13.27. This will not affect  $\mathbf{V}_{o}$ , but the value of  $\mathbf{I}_{2}$  in this example is the negative of that of  $\mathbf{I}_{2}$  in Practice Prob. 13.1. The advantage of using the T- equivalent model for the magnetically coupled coils is that in Fig. 13.29 we do not need to bother with the dot on the coupled coils.

Solve the problem in Example 13.1 (see Fig. 13.9) using the T- equivalent model for the magnetically coupled coils.

Answer:  $13 / - 49.4^{\circ}$  A,  $2.91 / 14.04^{\circ}$  A.

# 13.5 Ideal Transformers

An ideal transformer is one with perfect coupling  $(k = 1)$ . It consists of two (or more) coils with a large number of turns wound on a common core of high permeability. Because of this high permeability of the core, the flux links all the turns of both coils, thereby resulting in a perfect coupling.

To see how an ideal transformer is the limiting case of two coupled inductors where the inductances approach infinity and the coupling is perfect, let us reexamine the circuit in Fig. 13.14. In the frequency domain,

$$
\begin{array}{r}\mathbf{V}_{1} = j\omega L_{1}\mathbf{I}_{1} + j\omega M\mathbf{I}_{2} \\ \mathbf{V}_{2} = j\omega M\mathbf{I}_{1} + j\omega L_{2}\mathbf{I}_{2} \end{array} \tag{13.49b}
$$

From Eq. (13.49a),  $\mathbf{I}_1 = (\mathbf{V}_1 - j\omega M\mathbf{I}_2) / j\omega L_1$  (we could have also used this equation to develop the current ratios instead of using the conservation of power which we will do shortly). Substituting this in Eq. (13.49b) gives

$$
\mathbf{V}_2 = j\omega L_2\mathbf{I}_2 + \frac{M\mathbf{V}_1}{L_1} -\frac{j\omega M^2\mathbf{I}_2}{L_1}
$$

But  $M = \sqrt{L_1L_2}$  for perfect coupling  $(k = 1)$ . Hence,

$$
\mathbf{V}_2 = j\omega L_2\mathbf{I}_2 + \frac{\sqrt{L_1L_2}\mathbf{V}_1}{L_1} -\frac{j\omega L_1L_2\mathbf{I}_2}{L_1} = \sqrt{\frac{L_2}{L_1}}\mathbf{V}_1 = n\mathbf{V}_1
$$

where  $n = \sqrt{L_2 / L_1}$  and is called the turns ratio. As  $L_1,L_2,M\to \infty$  such that  $n$  remains the same, the coupled coils become an ideal transformer. A transformer is said to be ideal if it has the following properties:

1. Coils have very large reactances  $(L_1,L_2,M\to \infty)$ . 
2. Coupling coefficient is equal to unity  $(k = 1)$ . 
3. Primary and secondary coils are lossless  $(R_1 = 0 = R_2)$ .

An ideal transformer is a unity- coupled, lossless transformer in which the primary and secondary coils have infinite self- inductances.

Figure 13.30 (a) Ideal transformer, (b) circuit symbol for an ideal transformer.

Iron- core transformers are close approximations to ideal transformers. These are used in power systems and electronics.

Figure 13.30(a) shows a typical ideal transformer; the circuit symbol is in Fig. 13.30(b). The vertical lines between the coils indicate an iron core as distinct from the air core used in linear transformers. The primary winding has  $N_1$  turns; the secondary winding has  $N_2$  turns.

When a sinusoidal voltage is applied to the primary winding as shown in Fig. 13.31, the same magnetic flux  $\phi$  goes through both windings. According to Faraday's law, the voltage across the primary winding is

$$
\nu_{1} = N_{1}\frac{d\phi}{dt} \tag{13.50a}
$$

while that across the secondary winding is

$$
\nu_{2} = N_{2}\frac{d\phi}{dt} \tag{13.50b}
$$

Dividing Eq. (13.50b) by Eq. (13.50a), we get

$$
\frac{\nu_2}{\nu_1} = \frac{N_2}{N_1} = n \tag{13.51}
$$

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-14/63c420e9-9220-47ad-935a-09e6b2aeb2a8/0eb890284127a310f300626a358274bf678285843b3a1da32e0f774006f62098.jpg)  
Figure 13.31 Relating primary and secondary quantities in an ideal transformer.

where  $n$  is, again, the turns ratio or transformation ratio. We can use the phasor voltages  $\mathbf{V}_1$  and  $\mathbf{V}_2$  rather than the instantaneous values  $\nu_1$  and  $\nu_2$ . Thus, Eq. (13.51) may be written as

$$
\frac{\mathbf{V}_2}{\mathbf{V}_1} = \frac{N_2}{N_1} = n \tag{13.52}
$$

For the reason of power conservation, the energy supplied to the primary must equal the energy absorbed by the secondary, since there are no losses in an ideal transformer. This implies that

$$
\nu_{1}i_{1} = \nu_{2}i_{2} \tag{13.53}
$$

In phasor form, Eq. (13.53) in conjunction with Eq. (13.52) becomes

$$
\frac{\mathbf{I}_1}{\mathbf{I}_2} = \frac{\mathbf{V}_2}{\mathbf{V}_1} = n \tag{13.54}
$$

showing that the primary and secondary currents are related to the turns ratio in the inverse manner as the voltages. Thus,

$$
\frac{\mathbf{I}_2}{\mathbf{I}_1} = \frac{N_1}{N_2} = \frac{1}{n} \tag{13.55}
$$

When  $n = 1$ , we generally call the transformer an isolation transformer. The reason will become obvious in Section 13.9.1. If  $n > 1$ , we have a step- up transformer, as the voltage is increased from primary to secondary  $(\mathbf{V}_2 > \mathbf{V}_1)$ . On the other hand, if  $n < 1$ , the transformer is a step- down transformer, since the voltage is decreased from primary to secondary  $(\mathbf{V}_2 < \mathbf{V}_1)$ .

A step- down transformer is one whose secondary voltage is less than its primary voltage.

A step- up transformer is one whose secondary voltage is greater than its primary voltage.

The ratings of transformers are usually specified as  $V_1 / V_2$ . A transformer with rating  $2400 / 120 \mathrm{~V}$  should have  $2400 \mathrm{~V}$  on the primary and  $120$  in the secondary (i.e., a step- down transformer). Keep in mind that the voltage ratings are in rms.

Power companies often generate at some convenient voltage and use a step- up transformer to increase the voltage so that the power can be transmitted at very high voltage and low current over transmission lines, resulting in significant cost savings. Near residential consumer premises, step- down transformers are used to bring the voltage down to  $120 \mathrm{~V}$ . Section 13.9.3 will elaborate on this.

It is important that we know how to get the proper polarity of the voltages and the direction of the currents for the transformer in Fig. 13.31. If the polarity of  $\mathbf{V}_1$  or  $\mathbf{V}_2$  or the direction of  $\mathbf{I}_1$  or  $\mathbf{I}_2$  is changed,  $n$  in Eqs. (13.51) to (13.55) may need to be replaced by  $- n$ . The two simple rules to follow are:

1. If  $\mathbf{V}_1$  and  $\mathbf{V}_2$  are both positive or both negative at the dotted terminals, use  $+n$  in Eq. (13.52). Otherwise, use  $-n$ .

2. If  $\mathbf{I}_1$  and  $\mathbf{I}_2$  both enter into or both leave the dotted terminals, use  $-n$  in Eq. (13.55). Otherwise, use  $+n$ .

The rules are demonstrated with the four circuits in Fig. 13.32.

Figure 13.32 Typical circuits illustrating proper voltage polarities and current directions in an ideal transformer.

Using Eqs. (13.52) and (13.55), we can always express  $\mathbf{V}_{1}$  in terms of  $\mathbf{V}_{2}$  and  $\mathbf{I}_{1}$  in terms of  $\mathbf{I}_{2}$ , or vice versa:

$$
\begin{array}{c c}{{\mathbf{V}_{1}=\frac{\mathbf{V}_{2}}{n}}}&{{\mathrm{or}}}&{{\mathbf{V}_{2}=n\mathbf{V}_{1}}}\\ {{\mathbf{I}_{1}=n\mathbf{I}_{2}}}&{{\mathrm{or}}}&{{\mathbf{I}_{2}=\frac{\mathbf{I}_{1}}{n}}}\end{array} \tag{13.56}
$$

The complex power in the primary winding is

$$
\mathbf{S}_{1} = \mathbf{V}_{1}\mathbf{I}_{1}^{*} = \frac{\mathbf{V}_{2}}{n} (n\mathbf{I}_{2})^{*} = \mathbf{V}_{2}\mathbf{I}_{2}^{*} = \mathbf{S}_{2} \tag{13.58}
$$

showing that the complex power supplied to the primary is delivered to the secondary without loss. The transformer absorbs no power. Of course, we should expect this, since the ideal transformer is lossless. The input impedance as seen by the source in Fig. 13.31 is found from Eqs. (13.56) and (13.57) as

$$
\mathbf{Z}_{\mathrm{in}} = \frac{\mathbf{V}_{1}}{\mathbf{I}_{1}} = \frac{1}{n^{2}}\frac{\mathbf{V}_{2}}{\mathbf{I}_{2}} \tag{13.59}
$$

It is evident from Fig. 13.31 that  $\mathbf{V}_{2} / \mathbf{I}_{2} = \mathbf{Z}_{L}$ , so that

$$
\mathbf{Z}_{\mathrm{in}} = \frac{\mathbf{Z}_{L}}{n^{2}} \tag{13.60}
$$

Notice that an ideal transformer reflects an impedance as the square of the turns ratio.

The input impedance is also called the reflected impedance, inasmuch as it appears as if the load impedance is reflected to the primary side. This ability of the transformer to transform a given impedance into another impedance provides us a means of impedance matching to ensure maximum power transfer. The idea of impedance matching is very useful in practice and will be discussed more in Section 13.9.2.

In analyzing a circuit containing an ideal transformer, it is common practice to eliminate the transformer by reflecting impedances and sources from one side of the transformer to the other. In the circuit of Fig. 13.33, suppose we want to reflect the secondary side of the circuit to the primary side. We find the Theorem equivalent of the circuit to the right of the terminals  $a - b$ . We obtain  $\mathbf{V}_{\mathrm{Th}}$  as the open- circuit voltage at terminals  $a - b$ , as shown in Fig. 13.34(a).

Figure 13.34(a) Obtaining  $\mathbf{V}_{\mathrm{Th}}$  for the circuit in Fig. 13.33, (b) obtaining  $\mathbf{Z}_{\mathrm{Th}}$  for the circuit in Fig. 13.33.

Because terminals  $a - b$  are open,  $\mathbf{I}_{1} = 0 = \mathbf{I}_{2}$  so that  $\mathbf{V}_{2} = \mathbf{V}_{s2}$ . Hence, From Eq. (13.56),

$$
\mathbf{V}_{\mathrm{Th}} = \mathbf{V}_{1} = \frac{\mathbf{V}_{2}}{n} = \frac{\mathbf{V}_{s2}}{n} \tag{13.61}
$$

To get  $\mathbf{Z}_{\mathrm{Th}}$ , we remove the voltage source in the secondary winding and insert a unit source at terminals  $a - b$ , as in Fig. 13.34(b). From Eqs. (13.56) and (13.57),  $\mathbf{I}_{1} = n\mathbf{I}_{2}$  and  $\mathbf{V}_{1} = \mathbf{V}_{2} / n$ , so that

$$
\mathbf{Z}_{\mathrm{Th}} = \frac{\mathbf{V}_{1}}{\mathbf{I}_{1}} = \frac{\mathbf{V}_{2} / n}{n\mathbf{I}_{2}} = \frac{\mathbf{Z}_{2}}{n^{2}},\qquad \mathbf{V}_{2} = \mathbf{Z}_{2}\mathbf{I}_{2} \tag{13.62}
$$

which is what we should have expected from Eq. (13.60). Once we have  $\mathbf{V}_{\mathrm{Th}}$  and  $\mathbf{Z}_{\mathrm{Th}}$ , we add the Thevenin equivalent to the part of the circuit in Fig. 13.33 to the left of terminals  $a - b$ . Figure 13.35 shows the result.

The general rule for eliminating the transformer and reflecting the secondary circuit to the primary side is: Divide the secondary impedance by  $n^{2}$ , divide the secondary voltage by  $n$ , and multiply the secondary current by  $n$ .

We can also reflect the primary side of the circuit in Fig. 13.33 to the secondary side. Figure 13.36 shows the equivalent circuit.

The rule for eliminating the transformer and reflecting the primary circuit to the secondary side is: Multiply the primary impedance by  $n^{2}$ , multiply the primary voltage by  $n$ , and divide the primary current by  $n$ .

Figure 13.36

Equivalent circuit for Fig. 13.33 obtained by reflecting the primary circuit to the secondary side.

According to Eq. (13.58), the power remains the same, whether calculated on the primary or the secondary side. But realize that this reflection approach only applies if there are no external connections between the primary and secondary windings. When we have external connections between the primary and secondary windings, we simply use regular mesh and nodal analysis. Examples of circuits where there are external connections between the primary and secondary windings are in Figs. 13.39 and 13.40. Also note that if the locations of the dots in Fig. 13.33 are changed, we might have to replace  $n$  by  $- n$  in order to obey the dot rule, illustrated in Fig. 13.32.

# Example 13.7

An ideal transformer is rated at  $2400 / 120\mathrm{V}$ ,  $9.6\mathrm{kVA}$ , and has 50 turns on the secondary side. Calculate: (a) the turns ratio, (b) the number of turns on the primary side, and (c) the current ratings for the primary and secondary windings.

# Solution:

(a) This is a step-down transformer, since  $V_{1} = 2,400\mathrm{V} > V_{2} = 120\mathrm{V}$ .

$$
n = \frac{V_2}{V_1} = \frac{120}{2,400} = 0.05
$$

(b)

$$
n = \frac{N_2}{N_1}\qquad \Rightarrow \qquad 0.05 = \frac{50}{N_1}
$$

or

$$
N_{1} = \frac{50}{0.05} = 1,000\mathrm{turns}
$$

(c)  $S = V_{1}I_{1} = V_{2}I_{2} = 9.6\mathrm{kVA}$ . Hence,

$$

Figure 13.37 For Example 13.8.

# Solution:

(a) The  $20 - \Omega$  impedance can be reflected to the primary side and we get

$$
\mathbf{Z}_{R} = \frac{20}{n^{2}} = \frac{20}{4} = 5\Omega
$$

Thus,

$$
\begin{array}{r l} & {\mathbf{Z}_{\mathrm{in}} = 4 - j6 + \mathbf{Z}_{R} = 9 - j6 = 10.82\underline{{\underline{{\mathbf{\Pi}}}}}\underline{{\mathbf{\Pi}}}\underline{{\mathbf{\Pi}}}\underline{{\mathbf{\Pi}}}\underline{{\mathbf{\Pi}}}\underline{{\mathbf{\Pi}}}\underline{{\mathbf{\Pi}}}\underline{{\mathbf{\Pi}}}\underline{{\mathbf{\Pi}}}\underline{{\mathbf{\Pi}}}\underline{{\mathbf{\Pi}}}\underline{{\mathbf{\Pi}}}\underline{{\mathbf{\Pi}}} = 10.82\underline{{\underline{{\mathbf{\Pi}}}}}\underline{{\mathbf{\Pi}}}\underline{{\mathbf{\Pi}}}\underline{{\mathbf{\Pi}}}\underline{{\mathbf{\Pi}}}\underline{{\mathbf{\Pi}}}\underline{{\mathbf{\Pi}}}\underline{{\mathbf{\Pi}}}\underline{{\mathbf{\Pi}}}\underline{{\mathbf{I}}}}\\ & {\mathbf{I}_{1} = \frac{120\underline{{\mathbf{\Pi}}}\underline{{\mathbf{\Pi}}}\underline{{\mathbf{\Pi}}}}{\mathbf{Z}_{\mathrm{in}}} = \frac{120\underline{{\mathbf{\Pi}}}\underline{{\mathbf{\Pi}}}\underline{{\mathbf{\Pi}}}}{10.82\underline{{\underline{{\mathbf{\Pi}}}}}\underline{{\mathbf{\Pi}}}\underline{{\mathbf{\Pi}}}\underline{{\mathbf{\Pi}}}\underline{{\mathbf{\Pi}}}} = 11.09\underline{{\underline{{\mathbf{\Pi}}}}}\underline{{\mathbf{\Pi}}}\underline{{\mathbf{\Pi}}}\underline{{\mathbf{\Pi}}}\underline{{\mathbf{\Pi}}}\underline{{\mathbf{\Pi}}}\underline{{\mathbf{\Pi}}}\underline{{\mathbf{\Pi}}}\underline{{\mathbf{\Pi}}}\underline{{\mathbf{\Pi}}}\underline{{\underline{{\mathbf{\Pi}}}}}} \end{array}
$$

(b) Because both  $\mathbf{I}_1$  and  $\mathbf{I}_2$  leave the dotted terminals,

$$
\begin{array}{l}{{\bf I}_{2} = -\frac{1}{n}{\bf I}_{1} = -5.545\big / 33.69^{\circ}\mathrm{A}}\\ {\bf V}_{o} = 20{\bf I}_{2} = 110.9\big / 213.69^{\circ}\mathrm{V}} \end{array}
$$

(c) The complex power supplied is

$$
\mathbf{S} = \mathbf{V}_{s} \mathbf{I}_{1}^{*} = (120 \underline{0^{\circ}})(11.09 \underline{-33.69^{\circ}}) = 1,330.8 \underline{-33.69^{\circ}} \mathrm{VA}

Figure 13.39 For Example 13.9.

# Solution:

Reflection to the secondary or primary side cannot be done with this circuit: There is direct connection between the primary and

secondary sides due to the  $30 - \Omega$  resistor. We apply mesh analysis. For mesh 1,

$$
-120 + (20 + 30)\mathbf{I}_{1} - 30\mathbf{I}_{2} + \mathbf{V}_{1} = 0
$$

or

$$
50\mathbf{I}_{1} - 30\mathbf{I}_{2} + \mathbf{V}_{1} = 120 \tag{13.9.1}
$$

For mesh 2,

$$
-\mathbf{V}_{2} + (10 + 30)\mathbf{I}_{2} - 30\mathbf{I}_{1} = 0
$$

or

$$
-30\mathbf{I}_{1} + 40\mathbf{I}_{2} - \mathbf{V}_{2} = 0 \tag{13.9.2}
$$

At the transformer terminals,

$$
\mathbf{V}_{2} = -\frac{1}{2}\mathbf{V}_{1} \tag{13.9.3}
$$

$$
\mathbf{I}_{2} = -2\mathbf{I}_{1} \tag{13.9.4}
$$

(Note that  $n = 1 / 2$ .) We now have four equations and four unknowns, but our goal is to get  $\mathbf{I}_{2}$ . So we substitute for  $\mathbf{V}_{1}$  and  $\mathbf{I}_{1}$  in terms of  $\mathbf{V}_{2}$  and  $\mathbf{I}_{2}$  in Eqs. (13.9.1) and (13.9.2). Equation (13.9.1) becomes

$$
-55\mathbf{I}_{2} - 2\mathbf{V}_{2} = 120 \tag{13.9.5}
$$

and Eq. (13.9.2) becomes

$$
15\mathbf{I}_{2} + 40\mathbf{I}_{2} - \mathbf{V}_{2} = 0 \Rightarrow \mathbf{V}_{2} = 55\mathbf{I}_{2} \tag{13.9.6}
$$

Substituting Eq. (13.9.6) in Eq. (13.9.5),

$$
-165\mathbf{I}_{2} = 120 \Rightarrow \mathbf{I}_{2} = -\frac{120}{165} = -0.7272\mathrm{~A}
$$

The power absorbed by the  $10 - \Omega$  resistor is

$$
P = (-0.7272)^{2}(10) = 5.3\mathrm{~W}
$$

Answer: 48 V.

# 13.6 Ideal Autotransformers

Unlike the conventional two- winding transformer we have considered so far, an autotransformer has a single continuous winding with a connection point called a tap between the primary and secondary sides. The tap is often adjustable so as to provide the desired turns ratio for stepping up or stepping down the voltage. This way, a variable voltage is provided to the load connected to the autotransformer.

An autotransformer is a transformer in which both the primary and the secondary are in a single winding.

Figure 13.41 shows a typical autotransformer. As shown in Fig. 13.42, the autotransformer can operate in the step- down or step- up mode. The autotransformer is a type of power transformer. Its major advantage over the two- winding transformer is its ability to transfer larger apparent power. Example 13.10 will demonstrate this. Another advantage is that an autotransformer is smaller and lighter than an equivalent two- winding transformer. However, since both the primary and secondary windings are one winding, electrical isolation (no direct electrical connection) is lost. (We will see how the property of electrical isolation in the conventional transformer is practically employed in Section 13.9.1. ) The lack of electrical isolation between the primary and secondary windings is a major disadvantage of the autotransformer.

Some of the formulas we derived for ideal transformers apply to ideal autotransformers as well. For the step- down autotransformer circuit of Fig. 13.42(a), Eq. (13.52) gives

$$
\boxed{\frac{\mathbf{V}_1}{\mathbf{V}_2} = \frac{N_1 + N_2}{N_2} = 1 + \frac{N_1}{N_2}} \tag{13.63}
$$

As an ideal autotransformer, there are no losses, so the complex power remains the same in the primary and secondary windings:

$$
\mathbf{S}_1 = \mathbf{V}_1\mathbf{I}_1^* = \mathbf{S}_2 = \mathbf{V}_2\mathbf{I}_2^* \tag{13.64}
$$

Equation (13.64) can also be expressed as

$$
V_{1}I_{1} = V_{2}I_{2}
$$

or

$$
\frac{V_2}{V_1} = \frac{I_1}{I_2} \tag{13.65}
$$

Thus, the current relationship is

$$
\frac{\mathbf{I}_1}{\mathbf{I}_2} = \frac{N_2}{N_1 + N_2} \tag{13.66}
$$

For the step- up autotransformer circuit of Fig. 13.42(b),

$$
\frac{\mathbf{V}_1}{N_1} = \frac{\mathbf{V}_2}{N_1 + N_2}
$$

or

$$
\frac{\mathbf{V}_1}{\mathbf{V}_2} = \frac{N_1}{N_1 + N_2} \tag{13.67}
$$

The complex power given by Eq. (13.64) also applies to the step- up autotransformer so that Eq. (13.65) again applies. Hence, the current relationship is

$$
\frac{\mathbf{I}_1}{\mathbf{I}_2} = \frac{N_1 + N_2}{N_1} = 1 + \frac{N_2}{N_1} \tag{13.68}
$$

A major difference between conventional transformers and autotransformers is that the primary and secondary sides of the autotransformer are not only coupled magnetically but also coupled conductively. The autotransformer can be used in place of a conventional transformer when electrical isolation is not required.

Compare the power ratings of the two- winding transformer in Fig. 13.43(a) and the autotransformer in Fig. 13.43(b).

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-14/63c420e9-9220-47ad-935a-09e6b2aeb2a8/f0c81d159a777ba77dd0680cd6fe4d2e6d2b70cbc0bbb7eeb0b61c9e1d5845c4.jpg)  
Figure 13.43 For Example 13.10.

# Solution:

Although the primary and secondary windings of the autotransformer are together as a continuous winding, they are separated in Fig. 13.43(b) for clarity. We note that the current and voltage of each winding of the autotransformer in Fig. 13.43(b) are the same as those for the two- winding transformer in Fig. 13.43(a). This is the basis of comparing their power ratings.

For the two- winding transformer, the power rating is

$$
S_{1} = 0.2(240) = 48\mathrm{VA}\qquad \mathrm{or}\qquad S_{2} = 4(12) = 48\mathrm{VA}
$$

For the autotransformer, the power rating is

$$
S_{1} = 4.2(240) = 1,008\mathrm{VA}\qquad \mathrm{or}\qquad S_{2} = 4(252) = 1,008\mathrm{VA}
$$

which is 21 times the power rating of the two- winding transformer.

Refer to Fig. 13.43. If the two- winding transformer is a 60- VA,  $120\mathrm{V} / 10\mathrm{V}$  transformer, what is the power rating of the autotransformer?

Answer: 780 VA.

Refer to the autotransformer circuit in Fig. 13.44. Calculate: (a)  $\mathbf{I}_1$ ,  $\mathbf{I}_2$ , and  $\mathbf{I}_o$  if  $\mathbf{Z}_L = 8 + j6\Omega$ , and (b) the complex power supplied to the load.

Figure 13.44 For Example 13.11.

# Solution:

(a) This is a step-up autotransformer with  $N_1 = 80$ ,  $N_2 = 120$ ,  $\mathbf{V}_1 = 120 / 30^\circ$ , so Eq. (13.67) can be used to find  $\mathbf{V}_2$  by

$$
\frac{\mathbf{V}_1}{\mathbf{V}_2} = \frac{N_1}{N_1 + N_2} = \frac{80}{200}
$$

or

$$
\mathbf{V}_2 = \frac{200}{80}\mathbf{V}_1 = \frac{200}{80} (120 / 30^\circ) = 300 / 30^\circ \mathbf{V}
$$

$$
\mathbf{I}_2 = \frac{\mathbf{V}_2}{\mathbf{Z}_L} = \frac{300 / 30^\circ}{8 + j6} = \frac{300 / 30^\circ}{10 / 36.87^\circ} = 30\underline{/ - 6.87^\circ}\mathbf{A}
$$

But

$$
\frac{\mathbf{I}_1}{\mathbf{I}_2} = \frac{N_1 + N_2}{N_1} = \frac{200}{80}
$$

or

$$
\mathbf{I}_1 = \frac{200}{80}\mathbf{I}_2 = \frac{200}{80} (30\underline{/ - 6.87^\circ}) = 75\underline{/ - 6.87^\circ}\mathbf{A}
$$

At the tap, KCL gives

$$
\mathbf{I}_1 + \mathbf{I}_o = \mathbf{I}_2
$$

or

$$
\mathbf{I}_o = \mathbf{I}_2 - \mathbf{I}_1 = 30\underline{/ - 6.87^\circ} -75\underline{/ - 6.87^\circ} = 45\underline{/173.13^\circ}\mathbf{A}
$$

(b) The complex power supplied to the load is

$$
\mathbf{S}_2 = \mathbf{V}_2\mathbf{I}_2^* = |\mathbf{I}_o|^2\mathbf{Z}_L = (30)^2 (10 / 36.87^\circ) = 9\underline{/36.87^\circ}\mathrm{kVA}
$$

Answer: 6.4 A, 16 A, 9.6 A.

# 13.7 Three-Phase Transformers

To meet the demand for three- phase power transmission, transformer connections compatible with three- phase operations are needed. We can achieve the transformer connections in two ways: by connecting three single- phase transformers, thereby forming a so- called transformer bank, or by using a special three- phase transformer. For the same kVA rating, a three- phase transformer is always smaller and cheaper than three single- phase transformers. When single- phase transformers are used, one must ensure that they have the same turns ratio  $n$  to achieve a balanced three- phase system. There are four standard ways of connecting three single- phase transformers or a three- phase transformer for three- phase operations: Y- Y,  $\Delta - \Delta$ , Y-  $\Delta$ , and  $\Delta - Y$ .

For any of the four connections, the total apparent power  $S_{T}$ , real power  $P_{T}$ , and reactive power  $Q_{T}$  are obtained as

$$
S_{T} = \sqrt{3} V_{L}I_{L} \tag{13.69a}
$$

$$
P_{T} = S_{T}\cos \theta = \sqrt{3} V_{L}I_{L}\cos \theta \tag{13.69b}
$$

$$
Q_{T} = S_{T}\sin \theta = \sqrt{3} V_{L}I_{L}\sin \theta \tag{13.69c}
$$

where  $V_{L}$  and  $I_{L}$  are, respectively, equal to the line voltage  $V_{Lp}$  and the line current  $I_{Lp}$  for the primary side, or the line voltage  $V_{Ls}$  and the line current  $I_{Ls}$  for the secondary side. Notice From Eq. (13.69) that for each of the four connections,  $V_{Ls}I_{Ls} = V_{Lp}I_{Lp}$ , since power must be conserved in an ideal transformer.

For the Y- Y connection (Fig. 13.46), the line voltage  $V_{Lp}$  at the primary side, the line voltage  $V_{Ls}$  on the secondary side, the line current  $I_{Lp}$  on the primary side, and the line current  $I_{Ls}$  on the secondary side are related to the transformer per phase turns ratio  $n$  according to Eqs. (13.52) and (13.55) as

$$
\begin{array}{c} V_{Ls} = nV_{Lp} \\ I_{Ls} = \frac{I_{Lp}}{n} \end{array} \tag{13.70b}
$$

Figure 13.47  $\Delta -\Delta$  three-phase transformer connection.

For the  $\Delta - \Delta$  connection (Fig. 13.47), Eq. (13.70) also applies for the line voltages and line currents. This connection is unique in the sense that if one of the transformers is removed for repair or maintenance, the other two form an open delta, which can provide three- phase voltages at a reduced level of the original three- phase transformer.

For the  $\mathbf{Y} - \Delta$  connection (Fig. 13.48), there is a factor of  $\sqrt{3}$  arising from the line- phase values in addition to the transformer per phase turns ratio  $n$ . Thus,

$$
\begin{array}{l} V_{Ls} = \frac{nV_{Lp}}{\sqrt{3}} \\ I_{Ls} = \frac{\sqrt{3}I_{Lp}}{n} \end{array} \tag{13.71b}
$$

Similarly, for the  $\Delta - \mathbf{Y}$  connection (Fig. 13.49),

$$
\begin{array}{l} V_{Ls} = n\sqrt{3} V_{Lp} \\ I_{Ls} = \frac{I_{Lp}}{n\sqrt{3}} \end{array} \tag{13.72b}

Figure 13.50 For Example 13.12.

# Solution:

(a) A careful observation of Fig. 13.50 shows that the primary side is Y-connected, while the secondary side is  $\Delta$ -connected. Thus, the three-phase transformer is Y- $\Delta$ , similar to the one shown in Fig. 13.48.

(b) Given a load with total apparent power  $S_{T} = 42\mathrm{kVA}$ , the turns ratio  $n = 5$ , and the secondary line voltage  $V_{Ls} = 240\mathrm{V}$ , we can find the secondary line current using Eq. (13.69a), by

$$
I_{Ls} = \frac{S_T}{\sqrt{3}V_{Ls}} = \frac{42,000}{\sqrt{3}(240)} = 101\mathrm{~A~}
$$

From Eq. (13.71),

$$
I_{Lp} = \frac{n}{\sqrt{3}} I_{Ls} = \frac{5\times 101}{\sqrt{3}} = 292\mathrm{~A~}
$$

$$
V_{Lp} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{n} V_{Ls} = \frac{\sqrt{3}\times 240}{5} = 83.14\mathrm{~V~}
$$

(c) Because the load is balanced, each transformer equally shares the total load and since there are no losses (assuming ideal transformers), the kVA rating of each transformer is  $S = S_{T} / 3 = 14\mathrm{kVA}$ . Alternatively, the transformer rating can be determined by the product of the phase current and phase voltage of the primary or secondary side. For the primary side, for example, we have a delta connection, so that the phase voltage is the same as the line voltage of  $240\mathrm{V}$ , while the phase current is  $I_{Lp} / \sqrt{3} = 58.34\mathrm{A}$ . Hence,  $S = 240\times 58.34 = 14\mathrm{kVA}$ .

# 13.8 PSpice Analysis of Magnetically Coupled Circuits

PSpice Analyzes magnetically coupled circuits just like inductor circuits except that the dot convention must be followed. In PSpice Schematic, the dot (not shown) is always next to pin 1, which is the left- hand terminal of the inductor when the inductor with part name L is placed (horizontally) without rotation on a schematic. Thus, the dot or pin 1 will be at the bottom after one  $90^{\circ}$  counterclockwise rotation, since rotation is always about pin 1. Once the magnetically coupled inductors are arranged with the dot convention in mind and their value

attributes are set in henries, we use the coupling symbol K_LINEAR to define the coupling. For each pair of coupled inductors, take the following steps:

1. Select Draw/Get New Part and type K_LINEAR.

2. Hit <enter> or click OK and place the K_LINEAR symbol on the schematic, as shown in Fig. 13.51. (Notice that K_LINEAR is not a component and therefore has no pins.)

3. DCLICKL on COUPLING and set the value of the coupling coefficient  $k$ .

4. DCLICKL on the boxed K (the coupling symbol) and enter the reference designator names for the coupled inductors as values of Li,  $i = 1, 2, \ldots , 6$ . For example, if inductors L20 and L23 are coupled, we set  $\mathrm{L1} = \mathrm{L20}$  and  $\mathrm{L2} = \mathrm{L23}$ . L1 and at least one other Li must be assigned values; other Li's may be left blank.

In step 4, up to six coupled inductors with equal coupling can be specified.

For the air- core transformer, the partname is XFRM_LINEAR. It can be inserted in a circuit by selecting Draw/Get Part Name and then typing in the part name or by selecting the part name from the analog.slb library. As shown typically in Fig. 13.52(a), the main attributes of the linear transformer are the coupling coefficient  $k$  and the inductance values L1 and L2 in henries. If the mutual inductance  $M$  is specified, its value must be used along with L1 and L2 to calculate  $k$ . Keep in mind that the value of  $k$  should lie between 0 and 1.

For the ideal transformer, the part name is XFRM_NONLINEAR and is located in the breakout.slb library. Select it by clicking Draw/ Get Part Name and then typing in the part name. Its attributes are the coupling coefficient and the numbers of turns associated with L1 and L2, as illustrated typically in Fig. 13.52(b). The value of the coefficient of mutual coupling  $k = 1$ .

PSpice has some additional transformer configurations that we will not discuss here.

# Solution:

The coupling coefficients of the three coupled inductors are determined as follows:

$$
k_{12} = \frac{M_{12}}{\sqrt{L_1L_2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3\times 3}} = 0.3333
$$

$$
k_{13} = \frac{M_{13}}{\sqrt{L_1L_3}} = \frac{1.5}{\sqrt{3\times 4}} = 0.433
$$

$$
k_{23} = \frac{M_{23}}{\sqrt{L_2L_3}} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3\times 4}} = 0.5774
$$

The operating frequency  $f$  is obtained from Fig. 13.53 as  $\omega = 12\pi = 2\pi f\to f = 6 \mathrm{Hz}$ .

The schematic of the circuit is portrayed in Fig. 13.54. Notice how the dot convention is adhered to. For L2, the dot (not shown) is on pin 1 (the left- hand terminal) and is therefore placed without rotation. For L1, in order for the dot to be on the right- hand side of the inductor, the inductor must be rotated through  $180^{\circ}$ . For L3, the inductor must be rotated through  $90^{\circ}$  so that the dot will be at the bottom. Note that the 2- H inductor  $(L_4)$  is not coupled. To handle the three coupled inductors, we use three K_LINEAR parts provided in the analog library and set the following attributes (by double- clicking on the symbol  $K$  in the box):

The right- hand values are the reference designators of the inductors on the schematic.

K1 - K_LINEAR  L1 = L1  L2 = L2  COUPLING = 0.3333  K2 - K_LINEAR  L1 = L1  L2 = L3  COUPLING = 0.433  K3 - K_LINEAR  L1 = L2  L2 = L3  COUPLING = 0.5774

# Solution:

1. Define. The problem is clearly defined and we can proceed to the next step.

2. Present. We have an ideal transformer and we are to find the input and the output voltages for that transformer. In addition, we are to use PSpice to solve for the voltages.

3. Alternative. We are required to use PSpice. We can use mesh analysis to perform a check.

4. Attempt. As usual, we assume  $\omega = 1$  and find the corresponding values of capacitance and inductance of the elements:

$$
\begin{array}{r l r l}{j10 = j\omega L} & {} & \Rightarrow & {} & {L = 10\mathrm{~H}}\\ {-j40 = \frac{1}{j\omega C}} & {} & \Rightarrow & {} & {C = 25\mathrm{~mF}} \end{array}
$$

Reminder: For an ideal transformer, the inductances of both the primary and secondary windings are infinitely large.

Figure 13.57 shows the schematic. For the ideal transformer, we set the coupling factor to 0.99999 and the numbers of turns to 400,000 and 100,000. The two VPRINT2 pseudocomponents are connected across the transformer terminals to obtain  $\mathbf{V}_{1}$  and  $\mathbf{V}_{2}$ . As a single- frequency analysis, we select Analysis/Setup/AC Sweep and enter  $Total Pts = 1$ , Start  $Freq = 0.1592$ , and Final  $Freq = 0.1592$ . After saving the schematic, we select Analysis/Simulate to simulate it. The output file includes:

This can be written as

$$

$$

5. Evaluate. We can check the answer by using mesh analysis as follows:

$$
\begin{array}{r l}{\mathrm{Loop~1}\quad} & {{} - 120 / 30^{\circ} + (80 - j40)I_{1} + V_{1} + 20(I_{1} - I_{2}) = 0}\\ {\mathrm{Loop~2}\quad} & {{}20(-I_{1} + I_{2}) - \mathbf{V}_{2} + (6 + j10)I_{2} = 0} \end{array}
$$

Figure 13.57 The schematic for the circuit in Fig. 13.56.

But  $V_{2} = - V_{1} / 4$  and  $I_{2} = - 4I_{1}$ . This leads to

$$
-120 / 30^{\circ} + (80 - j40)I_{1} + V_{1} + 20(I_{1} + 4I_{1}) = 0
$$

$$
(180 - j40)I_{1} + V_{1} = 120 / 30^{\circ}
$$

$$
20(-I_{1} - 4I_{1}) + V_{1} / 4 + (6 + j10)(-4I_{1}) = 0
$$

$$
(-124 - j40)I_{1} + 0.25V_{1} = 0\qquad \mathrm{or}\qquad I_{1} = V_{1} / (496 + j160)
$$

Substituting this into the first equation yields

$$
\begin{array}{r l} & {(180 - j40)V_{1} / (496 + j160) + V_{1} = 120 / 30^{\circ}}\\ & {\quad (184.39 / - 12.53^{\circ} / 521.2 / 17.88^{\circ})V_{1} + V_{1}}\\ & {= (0.3538 / - 30.41^{\circ} + 1)V_{1} = (0.3051 + 1 - j0.17909)V_{1} = 120 / 30^{\circ}}\\ & {\quad V_{1} = 120 / 30^{\circ} / 1.3173 / - 7.81^{\circ} = 91.1 / 37.81^{\circ}\mathrm{~V~}\quad \mathrm{and}}\\ & {\quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad} \end{array}

# 13.9 Applications

Transformers are the largest, the heaviest, and often the costliest of circuit components. Nevertheless, they are indispensable passive devices in electric circuits. They are among the most efficient machines, 95 percent efficiency being common and 99 percent being achievable. They have numerous applications. For example, transformers are used:

- To step up or step down voltage and current, making them useful for power transmission and distribution.

- To isolate one portion of a circuit from another (i.e., to transfer power without any electrical connection).

- As an impedance-matching device for maximum power transfer.

- In frequency-selective circuits whose operation depends on the response of inductances.

For more information on the many kinds of transformers, a good text is W. M. Flanagan, Handbook of Transformer Design and Applications, 2nd ed. (New York: McGraw- Hill, 1993).

Because of these diverse uses, there are many special designs for transformers (only some of which are discussed in this chapter): voltage transformers, current transformers, power transformers, distribution transformers, impedance- matching transformers, audio transformers, single- phase transformers, three- phase transformers, rectifier transformers, inverter transformers, and more. In this section, we consider three important applications: transformer as an isolation device, transformer as a matching device, and power distribution system.

# 13.9.1 Transformer as an Isolation Device

Electrical isolation is said to exist between two devices when there is no physical connection between them. In a transformer, energy is transferred by magnetic coupling, without electrical connection between the primary circuit and secondary circuit. We now consider three simple practical examples of how we take advantage of this property.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-14/63c420e9-9220-47ad-935a-09e6b2aeb2a8/06ce9c1f2af01099bea8c640f2d67a5fd1f12500072f27636a7bfb7243e91e8f.jpg)  
Figure 13.59 A transformer used to isolate an ac supply from a rectifier.

First, consider the circuit in Fig. 13.59. A rectifier is an electronic circuit that converts an ac supply to a dc supply. A transformer is often used to couple the ac supply to the rectifier. The transformer serves two purposes. First, it steps up or steps down the voltage. Second, it provides electrical isolation between the ac power supply and the rectifier, thereby reducing the risk of shock hazard in handling the electronic device.

As a second example, a transformer is often used to couple two stages of an amplifier, to prevent any dc voltage in one stage from affecting the dc bias of the next stage. Biasing is the application of a dc voltage to a transistor amplifier or any other electronic device in order to produce a desired mode of operation. Each amplifier stage is biased separately to operate in a particular mode; the desired mode of operation will be compromised without a transformer providing dc isolation. As shown in Fig. 13.60, only the ac signal is coupled through the transformer from one stage to the next. We recall that magnetic coupling does not exist with a dc voltage source. Transformers are used in radio and TV receivers to couple stages of high- frequency amplifiers. When the sole purpose of a transformer is to provide isolation, its turns ratio  $n$  is made unity. Thus, an isolation transformer has  $n = 1$ .

As a third example, consider measuring the voltage across  $13.2\mathrm{- kV}$  lines. It is obviously not safe to connect a voltmeter directly to such high- voltage lines. A transformer can be used both to electrically isolate the line power from the voltmeter and to step down the voltage to a safe level, as shown in Fig. 13.61. Once the voltmeter is used to

measure the secondary voltage, the turns ratio is used to determine the line voltage on the primary side.

Determine the voltage across the load in Fig. 13.62.

# Solution:

We can apply the superposition principle to find the load voltage. Let  $\nu_{L} = \nu_{L1} + \nu_{L2}$ , where  $\nu_{L1}$  is due to the dc source and  $\nu_{L2}$  is due to the ac source. We consider the dc and ac sources separately, as shown in Fig. 13.63. The load voltage due to the dc source is zero, because a time- varying voltage is necessary in the primary circuit to induce a voltage in the secondary circuit. Thus,  $\nu_{L1} = 0$ . For the ac source and a value of  $R_{s}$  so small it can be neglected,

$$
\frac{\mathbf{V}_2}{\mathbf{V}_1} = \frac{\mathbf{V}_2}{120} = \frac{1}{3}\qquad \mathrm{or}\qquad \mathbf{V}_2 = \frac{120}{3} = 40\mathbf{V}
$$

Hence,  $\mathbf{V}_{L2} = 40\mathbf{V}$  ac or  $\nu_{L2} = 40$  cos  $\omega t$ ; that is, only the ac voltage is passed to the load by the transformer. This example shows how the transformer provides dc isolation.

Answer: 110.

# 13.9.2 Transformer as a Matching Device

We recall that for maximum power transfer, the load resistance  $R_{L}$  must be matched with the source resistance  $R_{s}$ . In most cases, the two resistances are not matched; both are fixed and cannot be altered. However, an iron- core transformer can be used to match the load resistance to the source resistance. This is called impedance matching. For example, to connect a loudspeaker to an audio power amplifier requires a transformer, because the speaker's resistance is only a few ohms while the internal resistance of the amplifier is several thousand ohms.

Consider the circuit shown in Fig. 13.64. We recall from Eq. (13.60) that the ideal transformer reflects its load back to the primary with a

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-14/63c420e9-9220-47ad-935a-09e6b2aeb2a8/4d078ce9bf28be10f3513c7aa5716dea416f1518c9a422b987cc60e2b88c0660.jpg)

scaling factor of  $n^2$ . To match this reflected load  $R_L / n^2$  with the source resistance  $R_s$ , we set them equal,

$$
R_{s} = \frac{R_{L}}{n^{2}} \tag{13.73}
$$

Equation (13.73) can be satisfied by proper selection of the turns ratio  $n$ . From Eq. (13.73), we notice that a step- down transformer  $(n < 1)$  is needed as the matching device when  $R_s > R_L$ , and a step- up  $(n > 1)$  is required when  $R_s < R_L$ .

Figure 13.65 Using an ideal transformer to match the speaker to the amplifier; for Example 13.16.

The ideal transformer in Fig. 13.65 is used to match the amplifier circuit to the loudspeaker to achieve maximum power transfer. The Thevenin (or output) impedance of the amplifier is  $192 \Omega$ , and the internal impedance of the speaker is  $12 \Omega$ . Determine the required turns ratio.

# Solution:

We replace the amplifier circuit with the Thevenin equivalent and reflect the impedance  $\mathbf{Z}_L = 12 \Omega$  of the speaker to the primary side of the ideal transformer. Figure 13.66 shows the result. For maximum power transfer,

$$
\mathbf{Z}_{\mathrm{Th}} = \frac{\mathbf{Z}_L}{n^2}\qquad \mathrm{or}\qquad n^2 = \frac{\mathbf{Z}_L}{\mathbf{Z}_{\mathrm{Th}}} = \frac{12}{192} = \frac{1}{16}
$$

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-14/63c420e9-9220-47ad-935a-09e6b2aeb2a8/741d04039953c94ddc28322f310bf7e1deae80d52a500b4eea4fb4038a115d1f.jpg)  
Figure 13.66 Equivalent circuit of the circuit in Fig. 13.65; for Example 13.16.

Thus, the turns ratio is  $n = 1 / 4 = 0.25$

Using  $P = I^2 R$ , we can show that indeed the power delivered to the speaker is much larger than without the ideal transformer. Without the ideal transformer, the amplifier is directly connected to the speaker. The power delivered to the speaker is

$$
P_{L} = \left(\frac{\mathbf{V}_{\mathrm{Th}}}{\mathbf{Z}_{\mathrm{Th}} + \mathbf{Z}_{L}}\right)^{2}\mathbf{Z}_{L} = 288\mathbf{V}_{\mathrm{Th}}^{2}\mu \mathbf{W}
$$

With the transformer in place, the primary and secondary currents are

$$
I_{p} = \frac{\mathbf{V}_{\mathrm{Th}}}{\mathbf{Z}_{\mathrm{Th}} + \mathbf{Z}_{L} / n^{2}},\qquad I_{s} = \frac{I_{p}}{n}
$$

Hence,

$$
\begin{array}{r l} & {P_{L} = I_{s}^{2}\mathbf{Z}_{L} = \left(\frac{\mathbf{V}_{\mathrm{Th}} / n}{\mathbf{Z}_{\mathrm{Th}} + \mathbf{Z}_{L} / n^{2}}\right)^{2}\mathbf{Z}_{L}}\\ & {\qquad = \left(\frac{n\mathbf{V}_{\mathrm{Th}}}{n^{2}\mathbf{Z}_{\mathrm{Th}} + \mathbf{Z}_{L}}\right)^{2}\mathbf{Z}_{L} = 1,302\mathbf{V}_{\mathrm{Th}}^{2}\mu \mathbf{W}} \end{array}
$$

confirming what was said earlier.

Answer: 0.4, 12 V.

# 13.9.3 Power Distribution

13.9.3 Power DistributionA power system basically consists of three components: generation, transmission, and distribution. The local electric company operates a plant that generates several hundreds of megavolt- amperes (MVA), typically at about  $18\mathrm{kV}$ . As Fig. 13.67 illustrates, three- phase step- up transformers are used to feed the generated power to the transmission line. Why do we need the transformer? Suppose we need to transmit  $100,000\mathrm{VA}$  over a distance of  $50\mathrm{km}$ . Since  $S = VI$ , using a line voltage of  $1,000\mathrm{V}$  implies that the transmission line must carry  $100\mathrm{A}$  and this requires a transmission line of a large diameter. If, on the other hand, we use a line voltage of  $10,000\mathrm{V}$ , the current is only  $10\mathrm{A}$ . The smaller current reduces the required conductor size, producing considerable savings as well as minimizing transmission line  $I^2 R$  losses. To minimize losses, requires a step- up transformer. Without the transformer, the majority of the power generated would be lost on the transmission line. The ability of the transformer to step up or step down voltage and distribute power economically is one of the major reasons for generating ac rather than dc. Thus, for a given power, the larger the voltage, the better. Today,  $1\mathrm{MV}$  is the largest voltage in use; the level may increase as a result of research and experiments.

Beyond the generation plant, the power is transmitted for hundreds of miles through an electric network called the power grid. The three- phase power in the power grid is conveyed by transmission lines hung overhead from steel towers which come in a variety of sizes and shapes. The (aluminum- conductor, steel- reinforced) lines typically have overall diameters up to about  $40\mathrm{mm}$  and can carry current of up to  $1,380\mathrm{A}$ .

At the substations, distribution transformers are used to step down the voltage. The step- down process is usually carried out in stages. Power may be distributed throughout a locality by means of either overhead or underground cables. The substations distribute the power to residential, commercial, and industrial customers. At the receiving end, a residential customer is eventually supplied with  $120 / 240\mathrm{V}$ , while industrial or commercial customers are fed with higher voltages

One may ask, How would increasing the voltage not increase the current, thereby increasing  $I^2 R$  losses? Keep in mind that  $I = V_{\ell} / R$ , where  $V_{\ell}$  is the potential difference between the sending and receiving ends of the line. The voltage that is stepped up is the sending end voltage  $V$ , not  $V_{\ell}$ . If the receiving end is  $V_{R}$ , then  $V_{\ell} = V - V_{R}$ . Since  $V$  and  $V_{R}$  are close to each other,  $V_{\ell}$  is small even when  $V$  is stepped up.

such as  $460 / 208 \mathrm{V}$ . Residential customers are usually supplied by distribution transformers often mounted on the poles of the electric utility company. When direct current is needed, the alternating current is converted to dc electronically.

# Example 13.17

A distribution transformer is used to supply a household as in Fig. 13.68. The load consists of eight 100- W bulbs, a 350- W TV, and a  $15 - \mathrm{kW}$  kitchen range. If the secondary side of the transformer has 72 turns, calculate: (a) the number of turns of the primary winding, and (b) the current  $I_{p}$  in the primary winding.

Figure 13.68 For Example 13.17.

# Solution:

(a) The dot locations on the winding are not important, since we are only interested in the magnitudes of the variables involved. Since

$$
\frac{N_{p}}{N_{s}} = \frac{V_{p}}{V_{s}}
$$

we get

$$
N_{p} = N_{s} \frac{V_{p}}{V_{s}} = 72 \frac{2,400}{240} = 720 \text{turns}
$$

(b) The total power absorbed by the load is

$$
S = 8 \times 100 + 350 + 15,000 = 16.15 \mathrm{kW}
$$

But  $S = V_{p} I_{p} = V_{s} I_{s}$ , so that

$$
I_{p} = \frac{S}{V_{p}} = \frac{16,150}{2,400} = 6.729 \mathrm{A}
$$

# Practice Problem 13.17

In Example 13.17, if the eight 100- W bulbs are replaced by twelve 60- W bulbs and the kitchen range is replaced by a  $4.5 - \mathrm{kW}$  air- conditioner, find: (a) the total power supplied, (b) the current  $I_{p}$  in the primary winding.

Answer: (a)  $5.57 \mathrm{kW}$ , (b)  $2.321 \mathrm{A}$ .

# 13.10 Summary

1. Two coils are said to be mutually coupled if the magnetic flux  $\phi$  emanating from one passes through the other. The mutual inductance between the two coils is given by\[ M = k\sqrt{L_1L_2} \]where  $k$  is the coupling coefficient,  $0 < k < 1$ .

$$
M = k\sqrt{L_1L_2}
$$

where  $k$  is the coupling coefficient,  $0< k< 1$

2. If  $\nu_{1}$  and  $i_{1}$  are the voltage and current in coil 1, while  $\nu_{2}$  and  $i_{2}$  are the voltage and current in coil 2, then

$$
\nu_{1} = L_{1}\frac{d i_{1}}{d t} +M\frac{d i_{2}}{d t}\qquad \mathrm{and}\qquad \nu_{2} = L_{2}\frac{d i_{2}}{d t} +M\frac{d i_{1}}{d t}
$$

Thus, the voltage induced in a coupled coil consists of self- induced voltage and mutual voltage.

3. The polarity of the mutually-induced voltage is expressed in the schematic by the dot convention.

4. The energy stored in two coupled coils is

$$
\frac{1}{2} L_{1}i_{1}^{2} + \frac{1}{2} L_{2}i_{2}^{2}\pm Mi_{1}i_{2}
$$

5. A transformer is a four-terminal device containing two or more magnetically coupled coils. It is used in changing the current, voltage, or impedance level in a circuit.

6. A linear (or loosely coupled) transformer has its coils wound on a magnetically linear material. It can be replaced by an equivalent T or  $\Pi$  network for the purposes of analysis.

7. An ideal (or iron-core) transformer is a lossless  $(R_{1} = R_{2} = 0)$  transformer with unity coupling coefficient  $(k = 1)$  and infinite inductances  $(L_{1},L_{2},M\to \infty)$

8. For an ideal transformer,

$$
\mathbf{V}_2 = n\mathbf{V}_1,\qquad \mathbf{I}_2 = \frac{\mathbf{I}_1}{n},\qquad \mathbf{S}_1 = \mathbf{S}_2,\qquad \mathbf{Z}_R = \frac{\mathbf{Z}_L}{n^2}
$$

where  $n = N_2 / N_1$  is the turns ratio.  $N_{1}$  is the number of turns of the primary winding and  $N_{2}$  is the number of turns of the secondary winding. The transformer steps up the primary voltage when  $n > 1$  steps it down when  $n< 1$  or serves as a matching device when  $n = 1$

9. An autotransformer is a transformer with a single winding common to both the primary and the secondary circuits.

10. PSpice is a useful tool for analyzing magnetically coupled circuits.

11. Transformers are necessary in all stages of power distribution systems. Three-phase voltages may be stepped up or down by three-phase transformers.

12. Important uses of transformers in electronics applications are as electrical isolation devices and impedance-matching devices.

*13.96 Some modern power transmission systems now have major high- voltage DC transmission segments. There are a lot of good reasons for doing this but we will not go into them here. To go from the AC to DC, power electronics are used. We start with three- phase AC and then rectify it (using a full- wave rectifier). It was found that using a delta to wye and delta combination connected secondary would give us a much smaller ripple after the full- wave rectifier. How is this accomplished? Remember that these are real devices and are wound on common cores.

Hint: Use Figs. 13.47 and 13.49, and the fact that each coil of the wye connected secondary and each coil of the delta connected secondary are wound around the same core of each coil of the delta connected primary so the voltage of each of the corresponding coils are in phase. When the output leads of both secondaries are connected through full- wave rectifiers with the same load, you will see that the ripple is now greatly reduced. Please consult the instructor for more help if necessary.

# Enhancing Your Career

# Career in Control Systems

Control systems are another area of electrical engineering where circuit analysis is used. A control system is designed to regulate the behavior of one or more variables in some desired manner. Control systems play major roles in our everyday life. Household appliances such as heating and air- conditioning systems, switch- controlled thermostats, washers and dryers, cruise controllers in automobiles, elevators, traffic lights, manufacturing plants, navigation systems—all utilize control systems. In the aerospace field, precision guidance of space probes, the wide range of operational modes of the space shuttle, and the ability to maneuver space vehicles remotely from earth all require knowledge of control systems. In the manufacturing sector, repetitive production line operations are increasingly performed by robots, which are programmable control systems designed to operate for many hours without fatigue.

Control engineering integrates circuit theory and communication theory. It is not limited to any specific engineering discipline but may involve environmental, chemical, aeronautical, mechanical, civil, and electrical engineering. For example, a typical task for a control system engineer might be to design a speed regulator for a disk drive head.

A thorough understanding of control systems techniques is essential to the electrical engineer and is of great value for designing control systems to perform the desired task.

# 14.1 Introduction

In our sinusoidal circuit analysis, we have learned how to find voltages and currents in a circuit with a constant frequency source. If we let the amplitude of the sinusoidal source remain constant and vary the frequency, we obtain the circuit's frequency response. The frequency response may be regarded as a complete description of the sinusoidal steady- state behavior of a circuit as a function of frequency.

The frequency response of a circuit is the variation in its behavior with change in signal frequency.

The frequency response of a circuit may also be considered as the variation of the gain and phase with frequency.

The sinusoidal steady- state frequency responses of circuits are of significance in many applications, especially in communications and control systems. A specific application is in electric filters that block out or eliminate signals with unwanted frequencies and pass signals of the desired frequencies. Filters are used in radio, TV, and telephone systems to separate one broadcast frequency from another.

We begin this chapter by considering the frequency response of simple circuits using their transfer functions. We then consider Bode plots, which are the industry- standard way of presenting frequency response. We also consider series and parallel resonant circuits and encounter important concepts such as resonance, quality factor, cutoff frequency, and bandwidth. We discuss different kinds of filters and network scaling. In the last section, we consider one practical application of resonant circuits and two applications of filters.

# 14.2 Transfer Function

The transfer function  $\mathbf{H}(\omega)$  (also called the network function) is a useful analytical tool for finding the frequency response of a circuit. In fact, the frequency response of a circuit is the plot of the circuit's transfer function  $\mathbf{H}(\omega)$  versus  $\omega$  ,with  $\omega$  varying from  $\omega = 0$  to  $\omega = \infty$

A transfer function is the frequency- dependent ratio of a forced function to a forcing function (or of an output to an input). The idea of a transfer function was implicit when we used the concepts of impedance

and admittance to relate voltage and current. In general, a linear network can be represented by the block diagram shown in Fig. 14.1.

The transfer function  $\mathsf{H}(\omega)$  of a circuit is the frequency- dependent ratio of a phasor output  $\mathbf{Y}(\omega)$  (an element voltage or current) to a phasor input  $\mathbf{X}(\omega)$  (source voltage or current).

Thus,

$$
\mathbf{H}(\omega) = \frac{\mathbf{Y}(\omega)}{\mathbf{X}(\omega)} \tag{14.1}
$$

assuming zero initial conditions. Since the input and output can be either voltage or current at any place in the circuit, there are four possible transfer functions:

$$
\begin{array}{r l} & {\mathbf{H}(\omega) = \mathrm{Voltage~gain} = \frac{\mathbf{V}_{o}(\omega)}{\mathbf{V}_{i}(\omega)}}\\ & {\mathbf{H}(\omega) = \mathrm{Current~gain} = \frac{\mathbf{I}_{o}(\omega)}{\mathbf{I}_{i}(\omega)}}\\ & {\mathbf{H}(\omega) = \mathrm{Transfer~impedance} = \frac{\mathbf{V}_{o}(\omega)}{\mathbf{I}_{i}(\omega)}}\\ & {\mathbf{H}(\omega) = \mathrm{Transfer~admittance} = \frac{\mathbf{I}_{o}(\omega)}{\mathbf{V}_{i}(\omega)}} \end{array} \tag{14.2b}
$$

where subscripts  $i$  and  $o$  denote input and output values. Being a complex quantity,  $\mathbf{H}(\omega)$  has a magnitude  $H(\omega)$  and a phase  $\phi$ ; that is,  $\mathbf{H}(\omega) = H(\omega) / \phi$ .

To obtain the transfer function using Eq. (14.2), we first obtain the frequency- domain equivalent of the circuit by replacing resistors, inductors, and capacitors with their impedances  $R$ ,  $j\omega L$ , and  $1 / j\omega C$ . We then use any circuit technique(s) to obtain the appropriate quantity in Eq. (14.2). We can obtain the frequency response of the circuit by plotting the magnitude and phase of the transfer function as the frequency varies. A computer is a real time- saver for plotting the transfer function.

The transfer function  $\mathbf{H}(\omega)$  can be expressed in terms of its numerator polynomial  $\mathbf{N}(\omega)$  and denominator polynomial  $\mathbf{D}(\omega)$  as

$$
\mathbf{H}(\omega) = \frac{\mathbf{N}(\omega)}{\mathbf{D}(\omega)} \tag{14.3}
$$

where  $\mathbf{N}(\omega)$  and  $\mathbf{D}(\omega)$  are not necessarily the same expressions for the input and output functions, respectively. The representation of  $\mathbf{H}(\omega)$  in Eq. (14.3) assumes that common numerator and denominator factors in  $\mathbf{H}(\omega)$  have canceled, reducing the ratio to lowest terms. The roots of  $\mathbf{N}(\omega) = 0$  are called the zeros of  $\mathbf{H}(\omega)$  and are usually represented as  $j\omega = z_{1}, z_{2}, \ldots$ . Similarly, the roots of  $\mathbf{D}(\omega) = 0$  are the poles of  $\mathbf{H}(\omega)$  and are represented as  $j\omega = p_{1}, p_{2}, \ldots$ .

A zero, as a root of the numerator polynomial, is a value that results in a zero value of the function. A pole, as a root of the denominator polynomial, is a value for which the function is infinite.

To avoid complex algebra, it is expedient to replace  $j\omega$  temporarily with  $s$  when working with  $\mathbf{H}(\omega)$  and replace  $s$  with  $j\omega$  at the end.

Figure 14.1 A block diagram representation of a linear network.

In this context,  $\mathbf{X}(\omega)$  and  $\mathbf{Y}(\omega)$  denote the input and output phasors of a network; they should not be confused with the same symbolism used for reactance and admittance. The multiple usage of symbols is conventionally permissible due to lack of enough letters in the English language to express all circuit variables distinctly.

Some authors use  $\mathbf{H}(j\omega)$  for transfer instead of  $\mathbf{H}(\omega)$ , since  $\omega$  and  $j$  are an inseparable pair.

A zero may also be regarded as the value of  $s = j\omega$  that makes  $\mathbf{H}(s)$  zero, and a pole as the value of  $s = j\omega$  that makes  $\mathbf{H}(s)$  infinite.

# Example 14.1

For the  $RC$  circuit in Fig. 14.2(a), obtain the transfer function  $\mathbf{V}_{o} / \mathbf{V}_{s}$  and its frequency response. Let  $\nu_{s} = V_{m}\cos \omega t$ .

# Solution:

The frequency- domain equivalent of the circuit is in Fig. 14.2(b). By voltage division, the transfer function is given by

$$
\mathbf{H}(\omega) = \frac{\mathbf{V}_{o}}{\mathbf{V}_{s}} = \frac{1 / j\omega C}{R + 1 / j\omega C} = \frac{1}{1 + j\omega RC}
$$

where  $\omega_{0} = 1 / RC$ . To plot  $H$  and  $\phi$  for  $0< \omega < \infty$ , we obtain their values at some critical points and then sketch.

At  $\omega = 0$ ,  $H = 1$  and  $\phi = 0$ . At  $\omega = \infty$ ,  $H = 0$  and  $\phi = - 90^{\circ}$ . Also, at  $\omega = \omega_{0}$ ,  $H = 1 / \sqrt{2}$  and  $\phi = - 45^{\circ}$ . With these and a few more points as shown in Table 14.1, we find that the frequency response is as shown in Fig. 14.3. Additional features of the frequency response in Fig. 14.3 will be explained in Section 14.6.1 on low- pass filters.

For the circuit in Fig. 14.6, calculate the gain  $\mathbf{I}_{o}(\omega) / \mathbf{I}_{i}(\omega)$  and its poles and zeros.

# Solution:

By current division,

$$
\mathbf{I}_{o}(\omega) = \frac{4 + j2\omega}{4 + j2\omega + 1 / j0.5\omega}\mathbf{I}_{i}(\omega)
$$

or

$$
\frac{\mathbf{I}_{o}(\omega)}{\mathbf{I}_{i}(\omega)} = \frac{j0.5\omega(4 + j2\omega)}{1 + j2\omega + (j\omega)^{2}} = \frac{s(s + 2)}{s^{2} + 2s + 1},\qquad s = j\omega
$$

The zeros are at

$$
s(s + 2) = 0\qquad \Rightarrow \qquad z_{1} = 0,z_{2} = -2
$$

The poles are at

$$
s^{2} + 2s + 1 = (s + 1)^{2} = 0
$$

Thus, there is a repeated pole (or double pole) at  $p = - 1$

Find the transfer function  $\mathbf{V}_{o}(\omega) / \mathbf{I}_{i}(\omega)$  for the circuit in Fig. 14.7. Obtain its zeros and poles.

# 14.3 The Decibel Scale

It is not always easy to get a quick plot of the magnitude and phase of the transfer function as we did above. A more systematic way of obtaining the frequency response is to use Bode plots. Before we begin to construct Bode plots, we should take care of two important issues: the use of logarithms and decibels in expressing gain.

Alexander Graham Bell (1847- 1922) inventor of the telephone, was a Scottish- American scientist.

Alexander Graham Bell (1847- 1922) inventor of the telephone, was a Scottish- American scientist.Bell was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, a son of Alexander Melville Bell, a well- known speech teacher. Alexander the younger also became a speech teacher after graduating from the University of Edinburgh and the University of London. In 1866 he became interested in transmitting speech electrically. After his older brother died of tuberculosis, his father decided to move to Canada. Alexander was asked to come to Boston to work at the School for the Deaf. There he met Thomas A. Watson, who became his assistant in his electromagnetic transmitter experiment. On March 10, 1876, Alexander sent the famous first telephone message: "Watson, come here I want you." The bel, the logarithmic unit introduced in this chapter, is named in his honor.

Since Bode plots are based on logarithms, it is important that we keep the following properties of logarithms in mind:

1.  $\log P_{1}P_{2} = \log P_{1} + \log P_{2}$  
2.  $\log P_{1} / P_{2} = \log P_{1} - \log P_{2}$  
3.  $\log P^n = n\log P$  
4.  $\log 1 = 0$

Historical note: The bel is named after Alexander Graham Bell, the inventor of the telephone.

In communications systems, gain is measured in bels. Historically, the bel is used to measure the ratio of two levels of power or power gain  $G$ ; that is,

$$
G = \mathrm{Number~of~bels} = \log_{10}\frac{P_2}{P_1} \tag{14.4}
$$

The decibel (dB) provides us with a unit of less magnitude. It is  $1 / 10$ th of a bel and is given by

$$
G_{\mathrm{dB}} = 10\log_{10}\frac{P_2}{P_1} \tag{14.5}
$$

When  $P_{1} = P_{2}$ , there is no change in power and the gain is  $0$  dB. If  $P_{2} = 2P_{1}$ , the gain is

$$
G_{\mathrm{dB}} = 10\log_{10}2\simeq 3\mathrm{dB} \tag{14.6}
$$

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-14/63c420e9-9220-47ad-935a-09e6b2aeb2a8/d2874ff21fd67d815d98cc10b237af159875e63b71dba93abfd0905a9236e3d9.jpg)  
Figure 14.8 Voltage-current relationships for a four-terminal network.

and when  $P_{2} = 0.5P_{1}$ , the gain is

$$
G_{\mathrm{dB}} = 10\log_{10}0.5\simeq -3\mathrm{dB} \tag{14.7}
$$

Equations (14.6) and (14.7) show another reason why logarithms are greatly used: The logarithm of the reciprocal of a quantity is simply negative the logarithm of that quantity.

Alternatively, the gain  $G$  can be expressed in terms of voltage or current ratio. To do so, consider the network shown in Fig. 14.8. If  $P_{1}$  is the input power,  $P_{2}$  is the output (load) power,  $R_{1}$  is the input resistance,

and  $R_{2}$  is the load resistance, then  $P_{1} = 0.5V_{1}^{2} / R_{1}$  and  $P_{2} = 0.5V_{2}^{2} / R_{2}$  and Eq. (14.5) becomes

$$
\begin{array}{r l} & {G_{\mathrm{dB}} = 10\log_{10}\frac{P_{2}}{P_{1}} = 10\log_{10}\frac{V_{2}^{2} / R_{2}}{V_{1}^{2} / R_{1}}}\\ & {\qquad = 10\log_{10}\left(\frac{V_{2}}{V_{1}}\right)^{2} + 10\log_{10}\frac{R_{1}}{R_{2}}}\\ & {G_{\mathrm{dB}} = 20\log_{10}\frac{V_{2}}{V_{1}} -10\log_{10}\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}}} \end{array} \tag{14.8}
$$

For the case when  $R_{2} = R_{1}$ , a condition that is often assumed when comparing voltage levels, Eq. (14.9) becomes

$$
G_{\mathrm{dB}} = 20\log_{10}\frac{V_{2}}{V_{1}} \tag{14.10}
$$

Instead, if  $P_{1} = I_{1}^{2}R_{1}$  and  $P_{2} = I_{2}^{2}R_{2}$ , for  $R_{1} = R_{2}$ , we obtain

$$
G_{\mathrm{dB}} = 20\log_{10}\frac{I_{2}}{I_{1}} \tag{14.11}
$$

Three things are important to note from Eqs. (14.5), (14.10), and (14.11):

1. That  $10\log_{10}$  is used for power, while  $20\log_{10}$  is used for voltage or current, because of the square relationship between them  $(P = V^{2} / R = I^{2}R)$ . 
2. That the dB value is a logarithmic measurement of the ratio of one variable to another of the same type. Therefore, it applies in expressing the transfer function  $H$  in Eqs. (14.2a) and (14.2b), which are dimensionless quantities, but not in expressing  $H$  in Eqs. (14.2c) and (14.2d). 
3. It is important to note that we only use voltage and current magnitudes in Eqs. (14.10) and (14.11). Negative signs and angles will be handled independently as we will see in Section 14.4.

With this in mind, we now apply the concepts of logarithms and decibels to construct Bode plots.

# 14.4 Bode Plots

Obtaining the frequency response from the transfer function as we did in Section 14.2 is an uphill task. The frequency range required in frequency response is often so wide that it is inconvenient to use a linear scale for the frequency axis. Also, there is a more systematic way of locating the important features of the magnitude and phase plots of the transfer function. For these reasons, it has become standard practice to plot the transfer function on a pair of semilogarithmic plots: The magnitude in decibels is plotted against the logarithm of the frequency; on a separate plot, the phase in degrees is plotted against the logarithm of the frequency. Such semilogarithmic plots of the transfer function—known as Bode plots—have become the industry standard.

Bode plots are semilog plots of the magnitude (in decibels) and phase (in degrees) of a transfer function versus frequency.

Historical note: Named after Hendrik W. Bode (1905- 1982), an engineer with the Bell Telephone Laboratories, for his pioneering work in the 1930s and 1940s.

Bode plots contain the same information as the nonlogarithmic plots discussed in the previous section, but they are much easier to construct, as we shall see shortly.

The transfer function can be written as

$$
\mathbf{H} = H / \phi = He^{j\phi} \tag{14.12}
$$

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides,

$$
\ln \mathbf{H} = \ln H + \ln e^{j\phi} = \ln H + j\phi \tag{14.13}
$$

Figure 14.9 Bode plots for gain  $K$ : (a) magnitude plot, (b) phase plot.

Thus, the real part of  $\ln \mathbf{H}$  is a function of the magnitude while the imaginary part is the phase. In a Bode magnitude plot, the gain

$$
H_{\mathrm{dB}} = 20\log_{10}H \tag{14.14}
$$

is plotted in decibels (dB) versus frequency. Table 14.2 provides a few values of  $H$  with the corresponding values in decibels. In a Bode phase plot,  $\phi$  is plotted in degrees versus frequency. Both magnitude and phase plots are made on semilog graph paper.

A transfer function in the form of Eq. (14.3) may be written in terms of factors that have real and imaginary parts. One such representation might be

$$
\mathbf{H}(\omega) = \frac{K(j\omega)^{\pm}(1 + j\omega / z_{1})[1 + j2\zeta_{1}\omega / \omega_{k} + (j\omega / \omega_{k})]^{...}}{(1 + j\omega / p_{1})[1 + j2\zeta_{2}\omega / \omega_{n} + (j\omega / \omega_{n})]^{...}} \tag{14.15}
$$

which is obtained by dividing out the poles and zeros in  $\mathbf{H}(\omega)$ . The representation of  $\mathbf{H}(\omega)$  as in Eq. (14.15) is called the standard form.  $\mathbf{H}(\omega)$  may include up to seven types of different factors that can appear in various combinations in a transfer function. These are:

1. A gain  $K$

2. A pole  $(j\omega)^{-1}$  or zero  $(j\omega)$  at the origin

3. A simple pole  $1 / (1 + j\omega /p_{1})$  or zero  $(1 + j\omega /z_{1})$

4. A quadratic pole  $1 / [1 + j2\zeta_{2}\omega /\omega_{n} + (j\omega /\omega_{n})^{2}]$  or zero  $[1 + j2\zeta_{1}\omega /\omega_{k} + (j\omega /\omega_{k})^{2}]$

In constructing a Bode plot, we plot each factor separately and then add them graphically. The factors can be considered one at a time and then combined additively because of the logarithms involved. It is this mathematical convenience of the logarithm that makes Bode plots a powerful engineering tool.

We will now make straight- line plots of the factors listed above. We shall find that these straight- line plots known as Bode plots approximate the actual plots to a reasonable degree of accuracy.

Constant term: For the gain  $K$ , the magnitude is  $20\log_{10}K$  and the phase is  $0^{\circ}$ ; both are constant with frequency. Thus, the magnitude and phase plots of the gain are shown in Fig. 14.9. If  $K$  is negative, the magnitude remains  $20\log_{10}|K|$  but the phase is  $\pm 180^{\circ}$ .

Pole/zero at the origin: For the zero  $(j\omega)$  at the origin, the magnitude is  $20\log_{10}\omega$  and the phase is  $90^{\circ}$ . These are plotted in Fig. 14.10, where we notice that the slope of the magnitude plot is  $20\mathrm{dB}$  /decade, while the phase is constant with frequency.

The Bode plots for the pole  $(j\omega)^{- 1}$  are similar except that the slope of the magnitude plot is  $- 20\mathrm{dB}$  /decade while the phase is  $- 90^{\circ}$ . In

general, for  $(j\omega)^{N}$ , where  $N$  is an integer, the magnitude plot will have a slope of  $20N$  dB/decade, while the phase is  $90N$  degrees.

Simple pole/zero: For the simple zero  $(1 + j\omega /z_{1})$ , the magnitude is  $20\log_{10}|1 + j\omega /z_{1}|$  and the phase is  $\tan^{- 1}\omega /z_{1}$ . We notice that

$$
\begin{array}{r l r}{H_{\mathrm{dB}} = 20\log_{10}\left|1 + \frac{j\omega}{z_{1}}\right|} & \Rightarrow & {20\log_{10}1 = 0}\\ & {} & {\mathrm{as}\quad \omega \rightarrow 0}\\ {H_{\mathrm{dB}} = 20\log_{10}\left|1 + \frac{j\omega}{z_{1}}\right|} & \Rightarrow & {20\log_{10}\frac{\omega}{z_{1}}}\\ & {} & {\mathrm{as}\quad \omega \rightarrow \infty} \end{array} \tag{14.16}
$$

showing that we can approximate the magnitude as zero (a straight line with zero slope) for small values of  $\omega$  and by a straight line with slope  $20~\mathrm{dB}$  /decade for large values of  $\omega$ . The frequency  $\omega = z_{1}$  where the two asymptotic lines meet is called the corner frequency or break frequency. Thus, the approximate magnitude plot is shown in Fig. 14.11(a), where the actual plot is also shown. Notice that the approximate plot is close to the actual plot except at the break frequency, where  $\omega = z_{1}$  and the deviation is  $20\log_{10}|1 + j1| = 20\log_{10}\sqrt{2}\simeq 3$  dB.

The phase  $\tan^{- 1}(\omega /z_{1})$  can be expressed as

$$
\phi = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{\omega}{z_{1}}\right) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}0, & \omega = 0\\ 45^{\circ}, & \omega = z_{1}\\ 90^{\circ}, & \omega \rightarrow \infty \end{array} \right. \tag{14.18}
$$

As a straight- line approximation, we let  $\phi \simeq 0$  for  $\omega \leq z_{1} / 10$ ,  $\phi \simeq 45^{\circ}$  for  $\omega = z_{1}$ , and  $\phi \simeq 90^{\circ}$  for  $\omega \geq 10z_{1}$ . As shown in Fig. 14.11(b) along with the actual plot, the straight- line plot has a slope of  $45^{\circ}$  per decade.

The Bode plots for the pole  $1 / (1 + j\omega /p_{1})$  are similar to those in Fig. 14.11 except that the corner frequency is at  $\omega = p_{1}$ , the magnitude has a slope of  $- 20$  dB/decade, and the phase has a slope of  $- 45^{\circ}$  per decade.

Quadratic pole/zero: The magnitude of the quadratic pole  $1 / [1 + j2\zeta_{2}\omega /\omega_{n} + (j\omega /\omega_{n})^{2}]$  is  $- 20\log_{10}|1 + j2\zeta_{2}\omega /\omega_{n} + (j\omega /\omega_{n})^{2}|$  and the phase is  $- \tan^{- 1}(2\zeta_{2}\omega /\omega_{n}) / (1 - \omega^{2} / \omega_{n}^{2})$ . But

$$
H_{\mathrm{dB}} = -20\log_{10}\left|1 + \frac{j2\zeta_{2}\omega}{\omega_{n}} +\left(\frac{j\omega}{\omega_{n}}\right)^{2}\right| \Rightarrow 0
$$

A decade is an interval between two frequencies with a ratio of 10; e.g., between  $\omega_{0}$  and  $10\omega_{0}$ , or between 10 and 100 Hz. Thus, 20 dB/decade means that the magnitude changes 20 dB whenever the frequency changes tenfold or one decade.

The special case of dc  $(\omega = 0)$  does not appear on Bode plots because log  $0 = \infty$ , implying that zero frequency is infinitely far to the left of the origin of Bode plots.

and

$$

(14.20)

Thus, the amplitude plot consists of two straight asymptotic lines: one with zero slope for  $\omega < \omega_{n}$  and the other with slope  $- 40$  dB/decade for  $\omega >\omega_{n}$  with  $\omega_{n}$  as the corner frequency. Figure 14.12(a) shows the approximate and actual amplitude plots. Note that the actual plot depends on the damping factor  $\zeta_{2}$  as well as the corner frequency  $\omega_{n}$ . The significant peaking in the neighborhood of the corner frequency should be added to the straight- line approximation if a high level of accuracy is desired. However, we will use the straight- line approximation for the sake of simplicity.

Figure 14.12 Bode plots of quadratic pole  $[1 + j2\zeta \omega /\omega_{n} - \omega^{2} / \omega_{n}^{2}]^{-1}$ : (a) magnitude plot, (b) phase plot.

The phase can be expressed as

$$
\phi = -\tan^{-1}\frac{2\zeta_2\omega / \omega_n}{1 - \omega^2 / \omega_n^2} = \left\{ \begin{array}{cc}0, & \omega = 0\\ -90^\circ , & \omega = \omega_n\\ -180^\circ , & \omega \rightarrow \infty \end{array} \right. \tag{14.21}
$$

There is another procedure for obtaining Bode plots that is faster and perhaps more efficient than the one we have just discussed. It consists in realizing that zeros cause an increase in slope, while poles cause a decrease. By starting with the low- frequency asymptote of the Bode plot, moving along the frequency axis, and increasing or decreasing the slope at each corner frequency, one can sketch the Bode plot immediately from the transfer function without the effort of making individual plots and adding them. This procedure can be used once you become proficient in the one discussed here.

Digital computers have rendered the procedure discussed here almost obsolete. Several software packages such as PSpice, MATLAB, Mathcad, and Micro- Cap can be used to generate frequency response plots. We will discuss PSpice later in the chapter.

The phase plot is a straight line with a slope of  $- 90^{\circ}$  per decade starting at  $\omega_{n} / 10$  and ending at  $10\omega_{n}$ , as shown in Fig. 14.12(b). We see again that the difference between the actual plot and the straight- line plot is due to the damping factor. Notice that the straight- line approximations for both magnitude and phase plots for the quadratic pole are the same as those for a double pole, that is,  $(1 + j\omega /\omega_{n})^{- 2}$ . We should expect this because the double pole  $(1 + j\omega /\omega_{n})^{- 2}$  equals the quadratic pole  $1 / [1 + j2\zeta_2\omega /\omega_n + (j\omega /\omega_n)^2 ]$  when  $\zeta_{2} = 1$ . Thus, the quadratic pole can be treated as a double pole as far as straight- line approximation is concerned.

For the quadratic zero  $[1 + j2\zeta_1\omega /\omega_k + (j\omega /\omega_k)^2 ]$ , the plots in Fig. 14.12 are inverted because the magnitude plot has a slope of  $40$  dB/decade while the phase plot has a slope of  $90^{\circ}$  per decade.

Table 14.3 presents a summary of Bode plots for the seven factors. Of course, not every transfer function has all seven factors. To sketch the Bode plots for a function  $\mathbf{H}(\omega)$  in the form of Eq. (14.15), for example, we first record the corner frequencies on the semilog graph paper, sketch the factors one at a time as discussed above, and then combine additively

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-14/63c420e9-9220-47ad-935a-09e6b2aeb2a8/b0706fe65bb7a71ff9680b6d18afc809cebd6e0052708983733ecbb6c74c1183.jpg)

the graphs of the factors. The combined graph is often drawn from left to right, changing slopes appropriately each time a corner frequency is encountered. The following examples illustrate this procedure.

Example 14.3 Construct the Bode plots for the transfer function

$$
\mathbf{H}(\omega) = \frac{200j\omega}{(j\omega + 2)(j\omega + 10)}
$$

# Solution:

We first put  $\mathbf{H}(\omega)$  in the standard form by dividing out the poles and zeros. Thus,

$$
\begin{array}{l}{{\bf H}(\omega) = \frac{10j\omega}{(1 + j\omega / 2)(1 + j\omega / 10)}}\\ {= \frac{10|j\omega|}{|1 + j\omega / 2||1 + j\omega / 10|}\bigg / 90^{\circ} - \tan^{-1}\omega /2 - \tan^{-1}\omega /10} \end{array}
$$

Hence, the magnitude and phase are

$$
\begin{array}{l}{{H_{\mathrm{dB}}=20\log_{10}10+20\log_{10}\left|j\omega\right|-20\log_{10}\left|1+\frac{j\omega}{2}\right|}}\\ {{\qquad-20\log_{10}\left|1+\frac{j\omega}{10}\right|}}\\ {{\qquad\phi=90^{\circ}-\tan^{-1}\frac{\omega}{2}-\tan^{-1}\frac{\omega}{10}}}\end{array}
$$

We notice that there are two corner frequencies at  $\omega = 2,10$ . For both the magnitude and phase plots, we sketch each term as shown by the dotted lines in Fig. 14.13. We add them up graphically to obtain the overall plots shown by the solid curves.

Obtain the Bode plots for

$$
\mathbf{H}(\omega) = \frac{j\omega + 10}{j\omega(j\omega + 5)^2}
$$

# Solution:

Putting  $\mathbf{H}(\omega)$  in the standard form, we get

$$
\mathbf{H}(\omega) = \frac{0.4(1 + j\omega / 10)}{j\omega(1 + j\omega / 5)^2}
$$

From this, we obtain the magnitude and phase as

$$
\begin{array}{l}{H_{\mathrm{dB}} = 20\log_{10}0.4 + 20\log_{10}\left|1 + \frac{j\omega}{10}\right| - 20\log_{10}\left|j\omega \right|}\\ {\qquad -40\log_{10}\left|1 + \frac{j\omega}{5}\right|}\\ {\phi = 0^{\circ} + \tan^{-1}\frac{\omega}{10} -90^{\circ} - 2\tan^{-1}\frac{\omega}{5}} \end{array}
$$

There are two corner frequencies at  $\omega = 5$ , 10 rad/s. For the pole with corner frequency at  $\omega = 5$ , the slope of the magnitude plot is  $- 40$  dB/decade and that of the phase plot is  $- 90^{\circ}$  per decade due to the power of 2. The

magnitude and the phase plots for the individual terms (in dotted lines) and the entire  $\mathbf{H}(j\omega)$  (in solid lines) are in Fig. 14.15.

# Example 14.5

Draw the Bode plots for

$$
\mathbf{H}(s) = \frac{s + 1}{s^2 + 12s + 100}
$$

# Solution:

1. Define. The problem is clearly stated and we follow the technique outlined in the chapter.

2. Present. We are to develop the approximate Bode plot for the given function,  $\mathbf{H}(s)$ .

3. Alternative. The two most effective choices would be the approximation technique outlined in the chapter, which we will use here, and MATLAB, which can actually give us the exact Bode plots.

4. Attempt. We express  $\mathbf{H}(s)$  as

$$
\mathbf{H}(\omega) = \frac{1 / 100(1 + j\omega)}{1 + j\omega 1.2 / 10 + (j\omega / 10)^{2}}
$$

For the quadratic pole,  $\omega_{n} = 10 \mathrm{rad / s}$ , which serves as the corner frequency. The magnitude and phase are

$$
\begin{array}{r l} & {H_{\mathrm{dB}} = -20\log_{10}100 + 20\log_{10}\left|1 + j\omega \right|}\\ & {\qquad -20\log_{10}\left|1 + \frac{j\omega 1.2}{10} -\frac{\omega^{2}}{100}\right|} \end{array}
$$

$$
\phi = 0^{\circ} + \tan^{-1}\omega - \tan^{-1}\left[\frac{\omega 1.2 / 10}{1 - \omega^{2} / 100}\right]
$$

Figure 14.17 shows the Bode plots. Notice that the quadratic pole is treated as a repeated pole at  $\omega_{k}$ , that is,  $(1 + j\omega / \omega_{k})^{2}$ , which is an approximation.

5. Evaluate. Although we could use MATLAB to validate the solution, we will use a more straightforward approach. First, we must realize that the denominator assumes that  $\zeta = 0$  for the approximation, so we will use the following equation to check our answer:

$$
\mathbf{H}(s) \simeq \frac{s + 1}{s^{2} + 10^{2}}
$$

We also note that we need to actually solve for  $H_{\mathrm{dB}}$  and the corresponding phase angle  $\phi$ . First, let  $\omega = 0$ .

$$
H_{\mathrm{dB}} = 20\log_{10}(1 / 100) = -40 \qquad \text{and} \qquad \phi = 0^{\circ}
$$

Now try  $\omega = 1$ .

$$
H_{\mathrm{dB}} = 20\log_{10}(1.4142 / 99) = -36.9 \mathrm{dB}
$$

which is the expected 3 dB up from the corner frequency.

$$
\phi = 45^{\circ} \qquad \text{from} \qquad \mathbf{H}(j) = \frac{j + 1}{-1 + 100}
$$

Now try  $\omega = 100$ .

$$
H_{\mathrm{dB}} = 20\log_{10}(100) - 20\log_{10}(9900) = 39.91 \mathrm{dB}
$$

$\phi$  is  $90^{\circ}$  from the numerator minus  $180^{\circ}$ , which gives  $- 90^{\circ}$ . We now have checked three different points and got close agreement, and, because this is an approximation, we can feel confident that we have worked the problem successfully.

You can reasonably ask why did we not check at  $\omega = 10$ ? If we just use the approximate value we used above, we end up with an infinite value, which is to be expected from  $\zeta = 0$  (see Fig. 14.12a). If we used the actual value of  $\mathbf{H}(j10)$  we will still end up being far from the approximate values, since  $\zeta = 0.6$  and Fig. 14.12a shows a significant deviation from the approximation. We could have reworked the problem with  $\zeta = 0.707$ , which would have gotten us closer to the approximation. However, we really have enough points without doing this.

6. Satisfactory? We are satisfied the problem has been worked successfully and we can present the results as a solution to the problem.

Practice Problem 14.5 Construct the Bode plots for

$$
H(s) = \frac{10}{s(s^{2} + 80s + 400)}

Given the Bode plot in Fig. 14.19, obtain the transfer function  $\mathbf{H}(\omega)$ .

# Solution:

To obtain  $\mathbf{H}(\omega)$  from the Bode plot, we keep in mind that a zero always causes an upward turn at a corner frequency, while a pole causes a

downward turn. We notice from Fig. 14.19 that there is a zero  $j\omega$  at the origin, which should have intersected the frequency axis at  $\omega = 1$ . This is indicated by the straight line with slope  $+20$  dB/decade. The fact that this straight line is shifted by  $40$  dB indicates that there is a  $40$ - dB gain; that is,

$$
40 = 20\log_{10}K\qquad \Rightarrow \qquad \log_{10}K = 2
$$

or

$$
K = 10^{2} = 100
$$

In addition to the zero  $j\omega$  at the origin, we notice that there are three factors with corner frequencies at  $\omega = 1,5$ , and  $20$  rad/s. Thus, we have:

1. A pole at  $p = 1$  with slope  $-20$  dB/decade to cause a downward turn and counteract the zero at the origin. The pole at  $p = 1$  is determined as  $1 / (1 + j\omega /1)$ .

2. Another pole at  $p = 5$  with slope  $-20$  dB/decade causing a downward turn. The pole is  $1 / (1 + j\omega /5)$ .

3. A third pole at  $p = 20$  with slope  $-20$  dB/decade causing a further downward turn. The pole is  $1 / (1 + j\omega /20)$ .

Putting all these together gives the corresponding transfer function as

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{\mathbf{H}(\omega)=\frac{100j\omega}{(1+j\omega/1)(1+j\omega/5)(1+j\omega/20)}}}\\ {{=\frac{j\omega10^{4}}{(j\omega+1)(j\omega+5)(j\omega+20)}}}\end{array}
$$

or

$$
\mathbf{H}(s) = \frac{10^{4}s}{(s + 1)(s + 5)(s + 20)},\qquad s = j\omega
$$

Obtain the transfer function  $\mathbf{H}(\omega)$  corresponding to the Bode plot in Fig. 14.20.

Answer:  $\mathbf{H}(\omega) = \frac{2,000,000(s + 5)}{(s + 10)(s + 100)^2}$ .

To see how to use MATLAB to produce Bode plots, refer to Section 14.11.

# 14.5 Series Resonance

The most prominent feature of the frequency response of a circuit may be the sharp peak (or resonant peak) exhibited in its amplitude characteristic. The concept of resonance applies in several areas of science and engineering. Resonance occurs in any system that has a complex conjugate pair of poles; it is the cause of oscillations of stored energy from one form to another. It is the phenomenon that allows frequency

discrimination in communications networks. Resonance occurs in any circuit that has at least one inductor and one capacitor.

Resonance is a condition in an RLC circuit in which the capacitive and inductive reactances are equal in magnitude, thereby resulting in a purely resistive impedance.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-14/63c420e9-9220-47ad-935a-09e6b2aeb2a8/336c726a8d9902c553c32119be6ac1f5d6a9aac34d7c7d687f8fe53d07356734.jpg)  
Figure 14.21 The series resonant circuit.

Resonant circuits (series or parallel) are useful for constructing filters, as their transfer functions can be highly frequency selective. They are used in many applications such as selecting the desired stations in radio and TV receivers.

Consider the series RLC circuit shown in Fig. 14.21 in the frequency domain. The input impedance is

$$
\mathbf{Z} = \mathbf{H}(\omega) = \frac{\mathbf{V}_s}{\mathbf{I}} = R + j\omega L + \frac{1}{j\omega C} \tag{14.22}
$$

or

$$
\mathbf{Z} = R + j\left(\omega L - \frac{1}{\omega C}\right) \tag{14.23}
$$

Resonance results when the imaginary part of the transfer function is zero, or

$$
\mathrm{Im}(\mathbf{Z}) = \omega L - \frac{1}{\omega C} = 0 \tag{14.24}
$$

The value of  $\omega$  that satisfies this condition is called the resonant frequency  $\omega_0$ . Thus, the resonance condition is

$$
\omega_0L = \frac{1}{\omega_0C} \tag{14.25}
$$

or

$$
\omega_0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}}\mathrm{rad / s} \tag{14.26}
$$

Since  $\omega_0 = 2\pi f_0$

$$
f_0 = \frac{1}{2\pi\sqrt{LC}}\mathrm{Hz} \tag{14.27}
$$

Note that at resonance:

Note No. 4 becomes evident from the fact that

$$
|\mathbf{V}_L| = \frac{V_m}{R}\omega_0L = QV_m
$$

$$
|\mathbf{V}_C| = \frac{V_m}{R}\frac{1}{\omega_0C} = QV_m
$$

where  $Q$  is the quality factor, defined in Eq. (14.38).

1. The impedance is purely resistive, thus,  $\mathbf{Z} = R$ . In other words, the  $LC$  series combination acts like a short circuit, and the entire voltage is across  $R$ . 
2. The voltage  $\mathbf{V}_s$  and the current  $\mathbf{I}$  are in phase, so that the power factor is unity. 
3. The magnitude of the transfer function  $\mathbf{H}(\omega) = \mathbf{Z}(\omega)$  is minimum. 
4. The inductor voltage and capacitor voltage can be much more than the source voltage.

The frequency response of the circuit's current magnitude

$$
I = |\mathbf{I}| = \frac{V_m}{\sqrt{R^2 + (\omega L - 1 / \omega C)^2}} \tag{14.28}
$$

is shown in Fig. 14.22; the plot only shows the symmetry illustrated in this graph when the frequency axis is a logarithm. The average power dissipated by the  $RLC$  circuit is

$$
P(\omega) = \frac{1}{2} I^{2}R \tag{14.29}
$$

The highest power dissipated occurs at resonance, when  $I = V_{m} / R$ , so that

$$
P(\omega_{0}) = \frac{1}{2}\frac{V_{m}^{2}}{R} \tag{14.30}
$$

At certain frequencies  $\omega = \omega_{1}, \omega_{2}$ , the dissipated power is half the maximum value; that is,

$$
P(\omega_{1}) = P(\omega_{2}) = \frac{(V_{m} / \sqrt{2})^{2}}{2R} = \frac{V_{m}^{2}}{4R} \tag{14.31}
$$

Hence,  $\omega_{1}$  and  $\omega_{2}$  are called the half- power frequencies.

The half- power frequencies are obtained by setting  $Z$  equal to  $\sqrt{2} R$  and writing

$$
\sqrt{R^{2} + \left(\omega L - \frac{1}{\omega C}\right)^{2}} = \sqrt{2} R \tag{14.32}
$$

Solving for  $\omega$ , we obtain

$$
\begin{array}{l}\omega_{1} = -\frac{R}{2L} +\sqrt{\left(\frac{R}{2L}\right)^{2} + \frac{1}{LC}} \\ \omega_{2} = \frac{R}{2L} +\sqrt{\left(\frac{R}{2L}\right)^{2} + \frac{1}{LC}} \end{array} \tag{14.33}
$$

We can relate the half- power frequencies with the resonant frequency. From Eqs. (14.26) and (14.33),

$$
\omega_{0} = \sqrt{\omega_{1}\omega_{2}} \tag{14.34}
$$

showing that the resonant frequency is the geometric mean of the half- power frequencies. Notice that  $\omega_{1}$  and  $\omega_{2}$  are in general not symmetrical around the resonant frequency  $\omega_{0}$ , because the frequency response is not generally symmetrical. However, as will be explained shortly, symmetry of the half- power frequencies around the resonant frequency is often a reasonable approximation.

Although the height of the curve in Fig. 14.22 is determined by  $R$ , the width of the curve depends on other factors. The width of the response curve depends on the bandwidth  $B$ , which is defined as the difference between the two half- power frequencies,

$$
B = \omega_{2} - \omega_{1} \tag{14.35}
$$

This definition of bandwidth is just one of several that are commonly used. Strictly speaking,  $B$  in Eq. (14.35) is a half- power bandwidth, because it is the width of the frequency band between the half- power frequencies.

The "sharpness" of the resonance in a resonant circuit is measured quantitatively by the quality factor  $Q$ . At resonance, the reactive energy

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-14/63c420e9-9220-47ad-935a-09e6b2aeb2a8/d60f914a1a37293a1244abd1d6d22c6371f6544d12a4814ac5304e3234e5c7f5.jpg)  
Figure 14.22 The current amplitude versus frequency for the series resonant circuit of Fig. 14.21.

Although the same symbol  $Q$  is used for the reactive power, the two are not equal and should not be confused.  $Q$  here is dimensionless, whereas reactive power  $Q$  is in VAR. This may help distinguish between the two.

in the circuit oscillates between the inductor and the capacitor. The quality factor relates the maximum or peak energy stored to the energy dissipated in the circuit per cycle of oscillation:

$$
Q = 2\pi \frac{\mathrm{Peak~energy~stored~in~the~circuit}}{\mathrm{Energy~dissipated~by~the~circuit}} \tag{14.36}
$$

It is also regarded as a measure of the energy storage property of a circuit in relation to its energy dissipation property. In the series  $RLC$  circuit, the peak energy stored is  $\frac{1}{2} LI^2$ , while the energy dissipated in one period is  $\frac{1}{2} (I^2 R)(1 / f_0)$ . Hence,

$$
Q = 2\pi \frac{\frac{1}{2}LI^2}{\frac{1}{2}I^2R(1 / f_0)} = \frac{2\pi f_0L}{R} \tag{14.37}
$$

or

$$
Q = \frac{\omega_0L}{R} = \frac{1}{\omega_0CR} \tag{14.38}
$$

Notice that the quality factor is dimensionless. The relationship between the bandwidth  $B$  and the quality factor  $Q$  is obtained by substituting Eq. (14.33) into Eq. (14.35) and utilizing Eq. (14.38).

$$
B = \frac{R}{L} = \frac{\omega_0}{Q} \tag{14.39}
$$

or  $B = \omega_0^2 CR$ . Thus,

The quality factor of a resonant circuit is the ratio of its resonant frequency to its bandwidth.

The quality factor is a measure of the selectivity (or "sharponess" of resonance) of the circuit.

Keep in mind that Eqs. (14.33), (14.38), and (14.39) only apply to a series  $RLC$  circuit.

As illustrated in Fig. 14.23, the higher the value of  $Q$ , the more selective the circuit is but the smaller the bandwidth. The selectivity of an  $RLC$  circuit is the ability of the circuit to respond to a certain frequency and discriminate against all other frequencies. If the band of frequencies to be selected or rejected is narrow, the quality factor of the resonant circuit must be high. If the band of frequencies is wide, the quality factor must be low.

A resonant circuit is designed to operate at or near its resonant frequency. It is said to be a high-  $Q$  circuit when its quality factor is equal to or greater than 10. For high-  $Q$  circuits  $(Q \geq 10)$ , the half- power frequencies are, for all practical purposes, symmetrical around the resonant frequency and can be approximated as

$$
\omega_{1}\simeq \omega_{0} - \frac{B}{2},\qquad \omega_{2}\simeq \omega_{0} + \frac{B}{2} \tag{14.40}
$$

High-  $Q$  circuits are used often in communications networks.

We see that a resonant circuit is characterized by five related parameters: the two half- power frequencies  $\omega_{1}$  and  $\omega_{2}$ , the resonant frequency  $\omega_{0}$ , the bandwidth  $B$ , and the quality factor  $Q$ .

In the circuit of Fig. 14.24,  $R = 2\Omega$ ,  $L = 1\mathrm{mH}$ , and  $C = 0.4\mu \mathrm{F}$ . (a) Find the resonant frequency and the half- power frequencies. (b) Calculate the quality factor and bandwidth. (c) Determine the amplitude of the current at  $\omega_{0}$ ,  $\omega_{1}$ , and  $\omega_{2}$ .

# Solution:

(a) The resonant frequency is

$$
\omega_{0} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{L C}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{10^{-3}\times0.4\times10^{-6}}} = 50\mathrm{krad / s}
$$

METHOD 1 The lower half- power frequency is

$$
\begin{array}{l}{\omega_{1} = -\frac{R}{2L} +\sqrt{\left(\frac{R}{2L}\right)^{2} + \frac{1}{L C}}}\\ {= -\frac{2}{2\times10^{-3}} +\sqrt{(10^{3})^{2} + (50\times10^{3})^{2}}}\\ {= -1 + \sqrt{1 + 2500}\mathrm{krad / s} = 49\mathrm{krad / s}} \end{array}
$$

Similarly, the upper half- power frequency is

$$
\omega_{2} = 1 + \sqrt{1 + 2500}\mathrm{krad / s} = 51\mathrm{krad / s}
$$

(b) The bandwidth is

$$
B = \omega_{2} - \omega_{1} = 2\mathrm{krad / s}
$$

or

$$
B = \frac{R}{L} = \frac{2}{10^{-3}} = 2\mathrm{krad / s}
$$

The quality factor is

$$
Q = \frac{\omega_{0}}{B} = \frac{50}{2} = 25
$$

METHOD 2 Alternatively, we could find

$$
Q = \frac{\omega_{0}L}{R} = \frac{50\times10^{3}\times10^{-3}}{2} = 25
$$

From  $Q$ , we find

$$
B = \frac{\omega_{0}}{Q} = \frac{50\times10^{3}}{25} = 2\mathrm{krad / s}
$$

Since  $Q > 10$ , this is a high-  $Q$  circuit and we can obtain the half- power frequencies as

$$
\begin{array}{l}\omega_{1} = \omega_{0} - \frac{B}{2} = 50 - 1 = 49\mathrm{krad / s} \\ \omega_{2} = \omega_{0} + \frac{B}{2} = 50 + 1 = 51\mathrm{krad / s} \end{array}
$$

as obtained earlier.

# 14.6 Parallel Resonance

The parallel  $RLC$  circuit in Fig. 14.25 is the dual of the series  $RLC$  circuit. So we will avoid needless repetition. The admittance is

$$
\mathbf{Y} = H(\omega) = \frac{\mathbf{I}}{\mathbf{V}} = \frac{1}{R} + j \omega C + \frac{1}{j \omega L} \tag{14.41}
$$

or

$$
\mathbf{Y} = \frac{1}{R} + j \left(\omega C - \frac{1}{\omega L}\right) \tag{14.42}
$$

Resonance occurs when the imaginary part of  $\mathbf{Y}$  is zero,

$$
\omega C - \frac{1}{\omega L} = 0 \tag{14.43}
$$

Figure 14.26 The current amplitude versus frequency for the series resonant circuit of Fig. 14.25.

or

$$
\omega_{0} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}} \mathrm{rad / s} \tag{14.44}
$$

We can see this from the fact that

$$
\left| \mathbf{I}_{L} \right| = \frac{I_{m} R}{\omega_{0} L} = Q I_{m}
$$

$$
\left| \mathbf{I}_{C} \right| = \omega_{0} C I_{m} R = Q I_{m}
$$

where  $Q$  is the quality factor, defined in Eq. (14.47).

which is the same as Eq. (14.26) for the series resonant circuit. The voltage  $|\mathbf{V}|$  is sketched in Fig. 14.26 as a function of frequency. Notice that at resonance, the parallel  $LC$  combination acts like an open circuit, so that the entire current flows through  $R$ . Also, the inductor and capacitor current can be much more than the source current at resonance.

We exploit the duality between Figs. 14.21 and 14.25 by comparing Eq. (14.42) with Eq. (14.23). By replacing  $R$ ,  $L$ , and  $C$  in the expressions

for the series circuit with  $1 / R$ ,  $C$ , and  $L$  respectively, we obtain for the parallel circuit

$$
\begin{array}{l}\omega_{1} = -\frac{1}{2RC} +\sqrt{\left(\frac{1}{2RC}\right)^{2} + \frac{1}{LC}} \\ \omega_{2} = \frac{1}{2RC} +\sqrt{\left(\frac{1}{2RC}\right)^{2} + \frac{1}{LC}} \end{array} \tag{14.45}
$$

$$
B = \omega_{2} - \omega_{1} = \frac{1}{RC} \tag{14.46}
$$

$$
Q = \frac{\omega_{0}}{B} = \omega_{0}RC = \frac{R}{\omega_{0}L} \tag{14.47}
$$

It should be noted that Eqs. (14.45) to (14.47) apply only to a parallel  $RLC$  circuit. Using Eqs. (14.45) and (14.47), we can express the half- power frequencies in terms of the quality factor. The result is

$$
\omega_{1} = \omega_{0}\sqrt{1 + \left(\frac{1}{2Q}\right)^{2} - \frac{\omega_{0}}{2Q}},\qquad \omega_{2} = \omega_{0}\sqrt{1 + \left(\frac{1}{2Q}\right)^{2} + \frac{\omega_{0}}{2Q}}
$$

Again, for high-  $Q$  circuits  $(Q \geq 10)$

$$
\omega_{1} \simeq \omega_{0} - \frac{B}{2}, \qquad \omega_{2} \simeq \omega_{0} + \frac{B}{2} \tag{14.49}
$$

Table 14.4 presents a summary of the characteristics of the series and parallel resonant circuits. Besides the series and parallel  $RLC$  considered here, other resonant circuits exist. Example 14.9 treats a typical example.

Figure 14.27 For Example 14.8.

In the parallel  $RLC$  circuit of Fig. 14.27, let  $R = 8 \mathrm{k}\Omega$ ,  $L = 0.2 \mathrm{mH}$ , and  $C = 8 \mu \mathrm{F}$ . (a) Calculate  $\omega_0$ ,  $Q$ , and  $B$ . (b) Find  $\omega_1$  and  $\omega_2$ . (c) Determine the power dissipated at  $\omega_0$ ,  $\omega_1$ , and  $\omega_2$ .

# Solution:

(a)

$$
\omega_0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.2 \times 10^{-3} \times 8 \times 10^{-6}}} = \frac{10^5}{4} = 25 \mathrm{krad / s}
$$

$$
Q = \frac{R}{\omega_0 L} = \frac{8 \times 10^3}{25 \times 10^3 \times 0.2 \times 10^{-3}} = 1,600
$$

$$
B = \frac{\omega_0}{Q} = 15.625 \mathrm{rad / s}
$$

(b) Due to the high value of  $Q$ , we can regard this as a high- $Q$  circuit, Hence,

$$
\begin{array}{l}\omega_1 = \omega_0 - \frac{B}{2} = 25,000 - 7.812 = 24,992 \mathrm{rad / s} \\ \omega_2 = \omega_0 + \frac{B}{2} = 25,000 + 7.812 = 25,008 \mathrm{rad / s} \end{array}
$$

(c) At  $\omega = \omega_0$ ,  $\mathbf{Y} = 1 / R$  or  $\mathbf{Z} = R = 8 \mathrm{k}\Omega$ . Then

$$
\mathbf{L}_o = \frac{\mathbf{V}}{\mathbf{Z}} = \frac{10 / - 90^\circ}{8,000} = 1.25 / - 90^\circ \mathrm{mA}
$$

Since the entire current flows through  $R$  at resonance, the average power dissipated at  $\omega = \omega_0$  is

$$
P = \frac{1}{2} |\mathbf{L}_o|^2 R = \frac{1}{2} (1.25 \times 10^{-3})^2 (8 \times 10^3) = 6.25 \mathrm{mW}
$$

or

$$
P = \frac{V_m^2}{2R} = \frac{100}{2 \times 8 \times 10^3} = 6.25 \mathrm{mW}
$$

At  $\omega = \omega_1$ ,  $\omega_2$ ,

$$
P = \frac{V_m^2}{4R} = 3.125 \mathrm{mW}
$$

A parallel resonant circuit has  $R = 100 \mathrm{k}\Omega$ ,  $L = 20 \mathrm{mH}$ , and  $C = 5 \mathrm{nF}$ . Calculate  $\omega_0$ ,  $\omega_1$ ,  $\omega_2$ ,  $Q$ , and  $B$ .

Answer: 100 krad/s, 99 krad/s, 101 krad/s, 50, 2 krad/s.

Determine the resonant frequency of the circuit in Fig. 14.28.

# Solution:

The input admittance is

$$
\mathbf{Y} = j\omega 0.1 + \frac{1}{10} +\frac{1}{2 + j\omega 2} = 0.1 + j\omega 0.1 + \frac{2 - j\omega 2}{4 + 4\omega^2}
$$

At resonance,  $\operatorname {Im}(\mathbf{Y}) = 0$  and

$$
\omega_{0}0.1 - \frac{2\omega_{0}}{4 + 4\omega_{0}^{2}} = 0\qquad \Rightarrow \qquad \omega_{0} = 2\mathrm{rad / s}
$$

# 14.7 Passive Filters

The concept of filters has been an integral part of the evolution of electrical engineering from the beginning. Several technological achievements would not have been possible without electrical filters. Because of this prominent role of filters, much effort has been expended on the theory, design, and construction of filters and many articles and books have been written on them. Our discussion in this chapter should be considered introductory.

A filter is a circuit that is designed to pass signals with desired frequencies and reject or attenuate others.

As a frequency- selective device, a filter can be used to limit the frequency spectrum of a signal to some specified band of frequencies. Filters are the circuits used in radio and TV receivers to allow us to select one desired signal out of a multitude of broadcast signals in the environment.

A filter is a passive filter if it consists of only passive elements  $R$ ,  $L$ , and  $C$ . It is said to be an active filter if it consists of active elements (such as transistors and op amps) in addition to passive elements  $R$ ,  $L$ , and  $C$ . We consider passive filters in this section and active filters in the next section.  $LC$  filters have been used in practical applications for more than eight decades.  $LC$  filter technology feeds related areas such as equalizers, impedance- matching networks, transformers, shaping networks, power dividers, attenuators, and directional couplers, and is continuously providing practicing engineers with opportunities to innovate and experiment. Besides the  $LC$  filters we study in these sections, there are other kinds of filters—such as digital filters, electromechanical filters, and microwave filters—which are beyond the level of this text.

Figure 14.32Ideal and actual frequency response of a low-pass filter.

As shown in Fig. 14.30, there are four types of filters whether passive or active:

1. A low-pass filter passes low frequencies and stops high frequencies, as shown ideally in Fig. 14.30(a). 
2. A high-pass filter passes high frequencies and rejects low frequencies, as shown ideally in Fig. 14.30(b). 
3. A band-pass filter passes frequencies within a frequency band and blocks or attenuates frequencies outside the band, as shown ideally in Fig. 14.30(c). 
4. A band-stop filter passes frequencies outside a frequency band and blocks or attenuates frequencies within the band, as shown ideally in Fig. 14.30(d).

Table 14.5 presents a summary of the characteristics of these filters. Be aware that the characteristics in Table 14.5 are only valid for first- or second- order filters—but one should not have the impression that only these kinds of filter exist. We now consider typical circuits for realizing the filters shown in Table 14.5.

# TABLE 14.5

Summary of the characteristics of ideal filters.  

<table><tr><td>Type of Filter</td><td>H(0)</td><td>H(∞)</td><td>H(ωc) or H(ω0)</td></tr><tr><td>Low-pass</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>1/√2</td></tr><tr><td>High-pass</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1/√2</td></tr><tr><td>Band-pass</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Band-stop</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr></table>

$\omega_{c}$  is the cutoff frequency for low- pass and high- pass filters;  $\omega_{0}$  is the center frequency for band- pass and band- stop filters.

# 14.7.1 Low-Pass Filter

A typical low- pass filter is formed when the output of an  $RC$  circuit is taken off the capacitor as shown in Fig. 14.31. The transfer function (see also Example 14.1) is

$$
\begin{array}{c}\mathbf{H}(\omega) = \frac{\mathbf{V}_o}{\mathbf{V}_i} = \frac{1 / j\omega C}{R + 1 / j\omega C}\\ \mathbf{H}(\omega) = \frac{1}{1 + j\omega RC} \end{array} \tag{14.50}
$$

Note that  $\mathbf{H}(0) = 1$ $\mathbf{H}(\infty) = 0$  . Figure 14.32 shows the plot of  $|H(\omega)|$  along with the ideal characteristic. The half- power frequency, which is equivalent to the corner frequency on the Bode plots but in the context of filters is usually known as the cutoff frequency  $\omega_{c}$  , is obtained by setting the magnitude of  $\mathbf{H}(\omega)$  equal to  $1 / \sqrt{2}$  , thus,

$$
H(\omega_{c}) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + \omega_{c}^{2}R^{2}C^{2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
$$

$$
\omega_{c} = \frac{1}{RC} \tag{14.51}
$$

The cutoff frequency is also called the rolloff frequency.

A low- pass filter is designed to pass only frequencies from dc up to the cutoff frequency  $\omega_{c}$ .

A low- pass filter can also be formed when the output of an  $RL$  circuit is taken off the resistor. Of course, there are many other circuits for low- pass filters.

# 14.7.2 High-Pass Filter

A high- pass filter is formed when the output of an  $RC$  circuit is taken off the resistor as shown in Fig. 14.33. The transfer function is

$$
\mathbf{H}(\omega) = \frac{\mathbf{V}_{o}}{\mathbf{V}_{i}} = \frac{R}{R + 1 / j\omega C}
$$

$$
\mathbf{H}(\omega) = \frac{j\omega RC}{1 + j\omega RC} \tag{14.52}
$$

Note that  $\mathbf{H}(0) = 0$ ,  $\mathbf{H}(\infty) = 1$ . Figure 14.34 shows the plot of  $|H(\omega)|$ . Again, the corner or cutoff frequency is

$$
\omega_{c} = \frac{1}{RC} \tag{14.53}
$$

A high- pass filter is designed to pass all frequencies above its cutoff frequency  $\omega_{c}$ .

A high- pass filter can also be formed when the output of an  $RL$  circuit is taken off the inductor.

# 14.7.3 Band-Pass Filter

The  $RLC$  series resonant circuit provides a band- pass filter when the output is taken off the resistor as shown in Fig. 14.35. The transfer function is

$$
\mathbf{H}(\omega) = \frac{\mathbf{V}_{o}}{\mathbf{V}_{i}} = \frac{R}{R + j(\omega L - 1 / \omega C)} \tag{14.54}
$$

We observe that  $\mathbf{H}(0) = 0$ ,  $\mathbf{H}(\infty) = 0$ . Figure 14.36 shows the plot of  $|H(\omega)|$ . The band- pass filter passes a band of frequencies  $(\omega_{1}< \omega < \omega_{2})$  centered on  $\omega_{0}$ , the center frequency, which is given by

$$
\omega_{0} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}} \tag{14.55}
$$

A band- pass filter is designed to pass all frequencies within a band of frequencies,  $\omega_{1}< \omega < \omega_{2}$ .

Because the band- pass filter in Fig. 14.35 is a series resonant circuit, the half- power frequencies, the bandwidth, and the quality factor are determined as in Section 14.5. A band- pass filter can also be formed by cascading the low- pass filter (where  $\omega_{2} = \omega_{c}$ ) in Fig. 14.31 with the

The cutoff frequency is the frequency at which the transfer function  $\mathbf{H}$  drops in magnitude to  $70.71\%$  of its maximum value. It is also regarded as the frequency at which the power dissipated in a circuit is half of its maximum value.

high- pass filter (where  $\omega_{1} = \omega_{c}$ ) in Fig. 14.33. However, the result would not be the same as just adding the output of the low- pass filter to the input of the high- pass filter, because one circuit loads the other and alters the desired transfer function.

# 14.7.4 Band-Stop Filter

A filter that prevents a band of frequencies between two designated values ( $\omega_{1}$  and  $\omega_{2}$ ) from passing is variably known as a band- stop, band- reject, or notch filter. A band- stop filter is formed when the output  $RLC$  series resonant circuit is taken off the  $LC$  series combination as shown in Fig. 14.37. The transfer function is

$$
\mathbf{H}(\omega) = \frac{\mathbf{V}_{o}}{\mathbf{V}_{i}} = \frac{j(\omega L - 1 / \omega C)}{R + j(\omega L - 1 / \omega C)} \tag{14.56}
$$

Notice that  $\mathbf{H}(0) = 1$ ,  $\mathbf{H}(\infty) = 1$ . Figure 14.38 shows the plot of  $|H(\omega)|$ . Again, the center frequency is given by

$$
\omega_{0} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}} \tag{14.57}
$$

while the half- power frequencies, the bandwidth, and the quality factor are calculated using the formulas in Section 14.5 for a series resonant circuit. Here,  $\omega_{0}$  is called the frequency of rejection, while the corresponding bandwidth ( $B = \omega_{2} - \omega_{1}$ ) is known as the bandwidth of rejection. Thus,

A band- stop filter is designed to stop or eliminate all frequencies within a band of frequencies,  $\omega_{1}< \omega < \omega_{2}$ .

Notice that adding the transfer functions of the band- pass and the band- stop gives unity at any frequency for the same values of  $R$ ,  $L$ , and  $C$ . Of course, this is not true in general but true for the circuits treated here. This is due to the fact that the characteristic of one is the inverse of the other.

In concluding this section, we should note that:

1. From Eqs. (14.50), (14.52), (14.54), and (14.56), the maximum gain of a passive filter is unity. To generate a gain greater than unity, one should use an active filter as the next section shows.

2. There are other ways to get the types of filters treated in this section.

3. The filters treated here are the simple types. Many other filters have sharper and complex frequency responses.

# Example 14.10

Determine what type of filter is shown in Fig. 14.39. Calculate the corner or cutoff frequency. Take  $R = 2\mathrm{k}\Omega$ ,  $L = 2\mathrm{H}$ , and  $C = 2\mu \mathrm{F}$ .

# Solution:

The transfer function is

$$
\mathbf{H}(s) = \frac{\mathbf{V}_{o}}{\mathbf{V}_{i}} = \frac{R||1 / sC}{sL + R||1 / sC}, \qquad s = j\omega \tag{14.10.1}
$$

But

$$
R\left\| \frac{1}{sC} = \frac{R / sC}{R + 1 / sC} = \frac{R}{1 + sRC}\right.
$$

Substituting this into Eq. (14.10.1) gives

$$
\mathbf{H}(s) = \frac{R / (1 + sRC)}{sL + R / (1 + sRC)} = \frac{R}{s^2RLC + sL + R}, \qquad s = j\omega \tag{s = j\omega}
$$

or

$$
\mathbf{H}(\omega) = \frac{R}{-\omega^2RLC + j\omega L + R} \tag{14.10.2}
$$

Because  $\mathbf{H}(0) = 1$  and  $\mathbf{H}(\infty) = 0$ , we conclude from Table 14.5 that the circuit in Fig. 14.39 is a second- order low- pass filter. The magnitude of  $\mathbf{H}$  is

$$
H = \frac{R}{\sqrt{(R - \omega^2RLC)^2 + \omega^2L^2}} \tag{14.10.3}
$$

The corner frequency is the same as the half- power frequency, that is, where  $\mathbf{H}$  is reduced by a factor of  $1 / \sqrt{2}$ . Because the dc value of  $H(\omega)$  is 1, at the corner frequency, Eq. (14.10.3) becomes after squaring

$$
H^{2} = \frac{1}{2} = \frac{R^{2}}{(R - \omega_{c}^{2}RLC)^{2} + \omega_{c}^{2}L^{2}}
$$

or

$$
2 = (1 - \omega_{c}^{2}LC)^{2} + \left(\frac{\omega_{c}L}{R}\right)^{2}
$$

Substituting the values of  $R$ ,  $L$ , and  $C$ , we obtain

$$
2 = (1 - \omega_{c}^{2}4\times 10^{-6})^{2} + (\omega_{c}10^{-3})^{2}
$$

Assuming that  $\omega_{c}$  is in krad/s,

$$
2 = (1 - 4\omega_{c}^{2})^{2} + \omega_{c}^{2}\qquad \mathrm{or}\qquad 16\omega_{c}^{4} - 7\omega_{c}^{2} - 1 = 0
$$

Solving the quadratic equation in  $\omega_{c}^{2}$ , we get  $\omega_{c}^{2} = 0.5509$  and  $- 0.1134$ . Because  $\omega_{c}$  is real,

$$
\omega_{c} = 0.742\mathrm{krad / s} = 742\mathrm{rad / s}
$$

For the circuit in Fig. 14.40, obtain the transfer function  $\mathbf{V}_{o}(\omega) / \mathbf{V}_{i}(\omega)$ . Identify the type of filter the circuit represents and determine the corner frequency. Take  $R_{1} = 100\Omega = R_{2}$ ,  $L = 2\mathrm{mH}$ .

Answer:  $\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1} + R_{2}}\left(\frac{j\omega}{j\omega + \omega_{c}}\right)$ , high- pass filter

$$
\omega_{c} = \frac{R_{1}R_{2}}{(R_{1} + R_{2})L} = 25\mathrm{krad / s}.
$$

Figure 14.40 For Practice Prob. 14.10.

# Example 14.11

If the band- stop filter in Fig. 14.37 is to reject a  $200\mathrm{- Hz}$  sinusoid while passing other frequencies, calculate the values of  $L$  and  $C$  .Take  $R = 150\Omega$  and the bandwidth as  $100\mathrm{Hz}$

# Solution:

We use the formulas for a series resonant circuit in Section 14.5.

$$
B = 2\pi (100) = 200\pi \mathrm{rad / s}
$$

But

$$
B = \frac{R}{L}\qquad \Rightarrow \qquad L = \frac{R}{B} = \frac{150}{200\pi} = 0.2387\mathrm{~H}
$$

Rejection of the  $200\mathrm{- Hz}$  sinusoid means that  $f_{0}$  is  $200\mathrm{Hz}$  , so that  $\omega_{0}$  in Fig.14.38 is

$$
\omega_{0} = 2\pi f_{0} = 2\pi (200) = 400\pi
$$

Given that  $\omega_{0} = 1 / \sqrt{L C}$

$$
C = \frac{1}{\omega_0^2L} = \frac{1}{(400\pi)^2(0.2387)} = 2.653\pi \mathrm{F}
$$

# Practice Problem 14.11

Answer:15.915 H,3.9 pF,101.

# 14.8 Active Filters

There are three major limitations to the passive filters considered in the previous section. First, they cannot generate gain greater than 1; passive elements cannot add energy to the network. Second, they may require bulky and expensive inductors. Third, they perform poorly at frequencies below the audio frequency range  $(300\mathrm{Hz}< f< 3,000\mathrm{Hz})$  . Nevertheless, passive filters are useful at high frequencies.

Active filters consist of combinations of resistors, capacitors, and op amps. They offer some advantages over passive RLC filters. First, they are often smaller and less expensive, because they do not require inductors. This makes feasible the integrated circuit realizations of filters. Second, they can provide amplifier gain in addition to providing the same frequency response as RLC filters. Third, active filters can be combined with buffer amplifiers (voltage followers) to isolate each stage of the filter from source and load impedance effects. This isolation allows designing the stages independently and then cascading them to realize the desired transfer function. (Bode plots, being logarithmic, may be added when transfer functions are cascaded.) However, active filters are less reliable and less stable. The practical

limit of most active filters is about  $100\mathrm{kHz}$  most active filters operate well below that frequency.

Filters are often classified according to their order (or number of poles) or their specific design type.

# 14.8.1 First-Order Low-Pass Filter

One type of first- order filter is shown in Fig. 14.41. The components selected for  $Z_{i}$  and  $Z_{f}$  determine whether the filter is low- pass or high- pass, but one of the components must be reactive.

Figure 14.42 shows a typical active low- pass filter. For this filter, the transfer function is

$$
\mathbf{H}(\omega) = \frac{\mathbf{V}_{o}}{\mathbf{V}_{i}} = -\frac{\mathbf{Z}_{f}}{\mathbf{Z}_{i}} \tag{14.58}
$$

where  $\mathbf{Z}_{i} = R_{i}$  and

$$
\mathbf{Z}_{f} = R_{f}| \frac{1}{j\omega C_{f}} = \frac{R_{f} / j\omega C_{f}}{R_{f} + 1 / j\omega C_{f}} = \frac{R_{f}}{1 + j\omega C_{f}R_{f}} \tag{14.59}
$$

Therefore,

$$
\mathbf{H}(\omega) = -\frac{R_{f}}{R_{i}}\frac{1}{1 + j\omega C_{f}R_{f}} \tag{14.60}
$$

We notice that Eq. (14.60) is similar to Eq. (14.50), except that there is a low frequency  $(\omega \rightarrow 0)$  gain or dc gain of  $- R_{f} / R_{i}$ . Also, the corner frequency is

$$
\omega_{c} = \frac{1}{R_{f}C_{f}} \tag{14.61}
$$

which does not depend on  $R_{i}$ . This means that several inputs with different  $R_{i}$  could be summed if required, and the corner frequency would remain the same for each input.

# 14.8.2 First-Order High-Pass Filter

Figure 14.43 shows a typical high- pass filter. As before,

$$
\mathbf{H}(\omega) = \frac{\mathbf{V}_{o}}{\mathbf{V}_{i}} = -\frac{\mathbf{Z}_{f}}{\mathbf{Z}_{i}} \tag{14.62}
$$

where  $\mathbf{Z}_{i} = R_{i} + 1 / j\omega C_{i}$  and  $\mathbf{Z}_{f} = R_{f}$  so that

$$
\mathbf{H}(\omega) = \frac{R_{f}}{R_{i} + 1 / j\omega C_{i}} = -\frac{j\omega C_{i}R_{f}}{1 + j\omega C_{i}R_{i}} \tag{14.63}
$$

This is similar to Eq. (14.52), except that at very high frequencies  $(\omega \rightarrow \infty)$ , the gain tends to  $- R_{f} / R_{i}$ . The corner frequency is

$$
\omega_{c} = \frac{1}{R_{i}C_{i}} \tag{14.64}
$$

# 14.8.3 Band-Pass Filter

The circuit in Fig. 14.42 may be combined with that in Fig. 14.43 to form a band- pass filter that will have a gain  $K$  over the required range of frequencies. By cascading a unity- gain low- pass filter, a unity- gain high- pass

This way of creating a band- pass filter, not necessarily the best, is perhaps the easiest to understand.

filter, and an inverter with gain  $- R_{f} / R_{i}$ , as shown in the block diagram of Fig. 14.44(a), we can construct a band- pass filter whose frequency response is that in Fig. 14.44(b). The actual construction of the band- pass filter is shown in Fig. 14.45.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-14/63c420e9-9220-47ad-935a-09e6b2aeb2a8/edb2c0dff5f7d39defbdaa4d298c74a420481fcc2d6ecdbbafe492bc8f615496.jpg)

Figure 14.45 Active band-pass filter.

The analysis of the band- pass filter is relatively simple. Its transfer function is obtained by multiplying Eqs. (14.60) and (14.63) with the gain of the inverter; that is,

$$
\begin{array}{l}\mathbf{H}(\omega) = \frac{\mathbf{V}_i}{\mathbf{V}_i} = \left(-\frac{1}{1 + j\omega C_1R}\right)\left(-\frac{j\omega C_2R}{1 + j\omega C_2R}\right)\left(-\frac{R_f}{R_i}\right)\\ = -\frac{R_f}{R_i}\frac{1}{1 + j\omega C_1R}\frac{j\omega C_2R}{1 + j\omega C_2R} \end{array} \tag{14.65}
$$

The low- pass section sets the upper corner frequency as

$$
\omega_{2} = \frac{1}{RC_{1}} \tag{14.66}
$$

while the high- pass section sets the lower corner frequency as

$$
\omega_{1} = \frac{1}{RC_{2}} \tag{14.67}
$$

With these values of  $\omega_{1}$  and  $\omega_{2}$ , the center frequency, bandwidth, and quality factor are found as follows:

$$
\begin{array}{l}\omega_0 = \sqrt{\omega_1\omega_2}\\ B = \omega_2 - \omega_1\\ Q = \frac{\omega_0}{B} \end{array} \tag{14.69}
$$

To find the passband gain  $K$ , we write Eq. (14.65) in the standard form of Eq. (14.15),

$$
\mathbf{H}(\omega) = -\frac{R_{f}}{R_{i}}\frac{j\omega / \omega_{1}}{(1 + j\omega / \omega_{1})(1 + j\omega / \omega_{2})} = -\frac{R_{f}}{R_{i}}\frac{j\omega\omega_{2}}{(\omega_{1} + j\omega)(\omega_{2} + j\omega)}
$$

At the center frequency  $\omega_{0} = \sqrt{\omega_{1}\omega_{2}}$ , the magnitude of the transfer function is

$$
|\mathbf{H}(\omega_0)| = \left|\frac{R_f}{R_i}\frac{j\omega_0\omega_2}{(\omega_1 + j\omega_0)(\omega_2 + j\omega_0)}\right| = \frac{R_f}{R_i}\frac{\omega_2}{\omega_1 + \omega_2} \tag{14.72}
$$

Thus, the passband gain is

$$
K = \frac{R_{f}}{R_{i}}\frac{\omega_{2}}{\omega_{1} + \omega_{2}} \tag{14.73}
$$

# 14.8.4 Band-Reject (or Notch) Filter

A band- reject filter may be constructed by parallel combination of a low- pass filter and a high- pass filter and a summing amplifier, as shown in the block diagram of Fig. 14.46(a). The circuit is designed such that the lower cutoff frequency  $\omega_{1}$  is set by the low- pass filter while the upper cutoff frequency  $\omega_{2}$  is set by the high- pass filter. The gap between  $\omega_{1}$  and  $\omega_{2}$  is the bandwidth of the filter. As shown in Fig. 14.46(b), the filter passes frequencies below  $\omega_{1}$  and above  $\omega_{2}$ . The block diagram in Fig. 14.46(a) is actually constructed as shown in Fig. 14.47. The transfer function is

$$
\mathbf{H}(\omega) = \frac{\mathbf{V}_o}{\mathbf{V}_i} = -\frac{R_f}{R_i}\left(-\frac{1}{1 + j\omega C_1R} -\frac{j\omega C_2R}{1 + j\omega C_2R}\right) \tag{14.74}
$$

Figure 14.47 Active band-reject filter.

The formulas for calculating the values of  $\omega_{1}, \omega_{2}$ , the center frequency, bandwidth, and quality factor are the same as in Eqs. (14.66) to (14.70).

To determine the passband gain  $K$  of the filter, we can write Eq. (14.74) in terms of the upper and lower corner frequencies as

$$
\begin{array}{r l r}{{\mathbf{H}(\omega)=\frac{R_{f}}{R_{i}}\bigg(\frac{1}{1+j\omega/\omega_{2}}+\frac{j\omega/\omega_{1}}{1+j\omega/\omega_{1}}\bigg)}}\\ &{}&{=\frac{R_{f}}{R_{i}}\frac{(1+j2\omega/\omega_{1}+(j\omega)^{2}/\omega_{1}\omega_{1})}{(1+j\omega/\omega_{2})(1+j\omega/\omega_{1})}}\end{array} \tag{14.75}
$$

Comparing this with the standard form in Eq. (14.15) indicates that in the two passbands ( $\omega \rightarrow 0$  and  $\omega \rightarrow \infty$ ) the gain is

$$
K = \frac{R_{f}}{R_{i}} \tag{14.76}
$$

We can also find the gain at the center frequency by finding the magnitude of the transfer function at  $\omega_{0} = \sqrt{\omega_{1} \omega_{2}}$ , writing

$$
\begin{array}{r l r}{{H(\omega_{0})=\left|\frac{R_{f}(1+j2\omega_{0}/\omega_{1}+(j\omega_{0})^{2}/\omega_{1}\omega_{1})}{R_{i}}\right|}}\\ &{}&\\ &{=\frac{R_{f}}{R_{i}}\frac{2\omega_{1}}{\omega_{1}+\omega_{2}}}\end{array} \tag{14.77}
$$

Again, the filters treated in this section are only typical. There are many other active filters that are more complex.

Design a low- pass active filter with a dc gain of 4 and a corner frequency of 500 Hz.

# Solution:

From Eq. (14.61), we find

$$
\omega_{c} = 2\pi f_{c} = 2\pi (500) = \frac{1}{R_{f}C_{f}} \tag{14.12.1}
$$

The dc gain is

$$
H(0) = -\frac{R_f}{R_i} = -4 \tag{14.12.2}
$$

We have two equations and three unknowns. If we select  $C_f = 0.2 \mu \mathrm{F}$ , then

$$
R_{f} = \frac{1}{2\pi(500)0.2\times 10^{-6}} = 1.59\mathrm{k}\Omega
$$

and

$$
R_{i} = \frac{R_{f}}{4} = 397.5\Omega
$$

We use a  $1.6 - \mathrm{k}\Omega$  resistor for  $R_{f}$  and a  $400 - \Omega$  resistor for  $R_{i}$ . Figure 14.42 shows the filter.

Design a high- pass filter with a high- frequency gain of 5 and a corner frequency of  $2 \mathrm{kHz}$ . Use a  $0.1 - \mu \mathrm{F}$  capacitor in your design.

Answer:  $R_{i} = 800 \Omega$  and  $R_{f} = 4 \mathrm{k}\Omega$

Design a band- pass filter in the form of Fig. 14.45 to pass frequencies between 250 and  $3,000 \mathrm{~Hz}$  and with  $K = 10$ . Select  $R = 20 \mathrm{k}\Omega$

# Solution:

1. Define. The problem is clearly stated and the circuit to be used in the design is specified.

2. Present. We are asked to use the op amp circuit specified in Fig. 14.45 to design a band-pass filter. We are given the value of  $R$  to use  $(20 \mathrm{k}\Omega)$ . In addition, the frequency range of the signals to be passed is  $250 \mathrm{~Hz}$  to  $3 \mathrm{kHz}$

3. Alternative. We will use the equations developed in Section 14.8.3 to obtain a solution. We will then use the resulting transfer function to validate the answer.

4. Attempt. Because  $\omega_{1} = 1 / RC_{2}$ , we obtain

$$
C_2 = \frac{1}{R\omega_1} = \frac{1}{2\pi f_1R} = \frac{1}{2\pi\times 250\times 20\times 10^3} = 31.83\mathrm{nF}
$$

Similarly, since  $\omega_{2} = 1 / RC_{1}$

$$
C_1 = \frac{1}{R\omega_2} = \frac{1}{2\pi f_2R} = \frac{1}{2\pi\times 3,000\times 20\times 10^3} = 2.65\mathrm{nF}
$$

From Eq. (14.73),

$$
\frac{R_{f}}{R_{i}} = K\frac{\omega_{1} + \omega_{2}}{\omega_{2}} = K\frac{f_{1} + f_{2}}{f_{2}} = \frac{10(3,250)}{3,000} = 10.83
$$

If we select  $R_{i} = \mathbf{10} \mathbf{k}\Omega$ , then  $R_{f} = 10.83R_{i} \simeq \mathbf{108.3} \mathbf{k}\Omega$ .

5. Evaluate. The output of the first op amp is given by

$$
\begin{array}{r}{\frac{V_{i} - 0}{20\mathrm{~k}\Omega} +\frac{V_{1} - 0}{20\mathrm{~k}\Omega} +\frac{s2.65\times10^{-9}(V_{1} - 0)}{1}}\\ {= 0\rightarrow V_{1} = -\frac{V_{i}}{1 + 5.3\times10^{-5}s}.} \end{array}
$$

The output of the second op amp is given by

$$
\frac{V_{1} - 0}{20 \mathrm{k}\Omega + \frac{1}{s31.83 \mathrm{nF}}} + \frac{V_{2} - 0}{20 \mathrm{k}\Omega} = 0 \rightarrow
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l}{{V_{2}=-\frac{6.366\times10^{-4}s V_{1}}{1+6.366\times10^{-4}s}}}\\ {{\mathrm{}}}\\ {{\mathrm{}=\frac{6.366\times10^{-4}s V_{i}}{(1+6.366\times10^{-4}s)(1+5.3\times10^{-5}s)}}}\end{array}
$$

The output of the third op amp is given by

$$
\begin{array}{r l} & {\frac{V_{2} - 0}{10\mathrm{~k}\Omega} +\frac{\mathrm{V}_{o} - 0}{108.3\mathrm{~k}\Omega} = 0\rightarrow V_{o} = 10.83V_{2}\rightarrow j2\pi \times 25^{\circ}}\\ & {\qquad V_{o} = -\frac{6.894\times10^{-3}s V_{i}}{(1 + 6.366\times10^{-4}s)(1 + 5.3\times10^{-5}s)}} \end{array}
$$

Let  $j2\pi \times 25^{\circ}$  and solve for the magnitude of  $V_{o} / V_{i}$

$$
\frac{V_{o}}{V_{i}} = \frac{-j10.829}{(1 + j1)(1)}
$$

$|V_{o} / V_{i}| = (\mathbf{0.7071})\mathbf{10.829}$ , which is the lower corner frequency point.

Let  $s = j2\pi \times 3000 = j18.849 \mathrm{k}\Omega$ . We then get

$$
\begin{array}{r l} & {\frac{V_{o}}{V_{i}} = \frac{-j129.94}{(1 + j12)(1 + j1)}}\\ & {\quad = \frac{129.94 / - 90^{\circ}}{(12.042 / 85.24^{\circ})(1.4142 / 45^{\circ})} = (\mathbf{0.7071})\mathbf{10.791} / - 18.61^{\circ}} \end{array}
$$

Clearly this is the upper corner frequency and the answer checks.

6. Satisfactory? We have satisfactorily designed the circuit and can present the results as a solution to the problem.

# Practice Problem 14.13

Design a notch filter based on Fig. 14.47 for  $\omega_{0} = 20 \mathrm{krad / s}$ ,  $K = 5$ , and  $Q = 10$ . Use  $R = R_{i} = 10 \mathrm{k}\Omega$ .

Answer:  $C_{1} = 4.762 \mathrm{nF}$ ,  $C_{2} = 5.263 \mathrm{nF}$ , and  $R_{f} = 50 \mathrm{k}\Omega$ .

# 14.9 Scaling

In designing and analyzing filters and resonant circuits or in circuit analysis in general, it is sometimes convenient to work with element values of  $1 \Omega$ ,  $1 \mathrm{H}$ , or  $1 \mathrm{F}$ , and then transform the values to realistic values by

scaling. We have taken advantage of this idea by not using realistic element values in most of our examples and problems; mastering circuit analysis is made easy by using convenient component values. We have thus eased calculations, knowing that we could use scaling to then make the values realistic.

There are two ways of scaling a circuit: magnitude or impedance scaling, and frequency scaling. Both are useful in scaling responses and circuit elements to values within the practical ranges. While magnitude scaling leaves the frequency response of a circuit unaltered, frequency scaling shifts the frequency response up or down the frequency spectrum.

# 14.9.1 Magnitude Scaling

Magnitude scaling is the process of increasing all impedances in a network by a factor, the frequency response remaining unchanged.

Recall that impedances of individual elements  $R$ ,  $L$ , and  $C$  are given by

$$
\mathbf{Z}_{R} = R, \qquad \mathbf{Z}_{L} = j\omega L, \qquad \mathbf{Z}_{C} = \frac{1}{j\omega C} \tag{14.78}
$$

In magnitude scaling, we multiply the impedance of each circuit element by a factor  $K_{m}$  and let the frequency remain constant. This gives the new impedances as

$$
\mathbf{Z}_{R}^{\prime} = K_{m}\mathbf{Z}_{R} = K_{m}R, \qquad \mathbf{Z}_{L}^{\prime} = K_{m}\mathbf{Z}_{L} = j\omega K_{m}L
$$

$$
\mathbf{Z}_{C}^{\prime} = K_{m}\mathbf{Z}_{C} = \frac{1}{j\omega C / K_{m}} \tag{14.79}
$$

Comparing Eq. (14.79) with Eq. (14.78), we notice the following changes in the element values:  $R \rightarrow K_{m}R$ ,  $L \rightarrow K_{m}L$ , and  $C \rightarrow C / K_{m}$ . Thus, in magnitude scaling, the new values of the elements and frequency are

$$
\begin{array}{l l}{{R^{\prime}=K_{m}R,}}&{{\quad L^{\prime}=K_{m}L}}\\ {{C^{\prime}=\frac{C}{K_{m}},}}&{{\quad\omega^{\prime}=\omega}}\end{array} \tag{14.80}
$$

The primed variables are the new values and the unprimed variables are the old values. Consider the series or parallel  $RLC$  circuit. We now have

$$
\omega_{0}^{\prime} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{L^{\prime}C^{\prime}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{K_{m}LC / K_{m}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}} = \omega_{0} \tag{14.81}
$$

showing that the resonant frequency, as expected, has not changed. Similarly, the quality factor and the bandwidth are not affected by magnitude scaling. Also, magnitude scaling does not affect transfer functions in the forms of Eqs. (14.2a) and (14.2b), which are dimensionless quantities.

Frequency scaling is equivalent to relabeling the frequency axis of a frequency response plot. It is needed when translating frequencies such as a resonant frequency, a corner frequency, a bandwidth, etc., to a realistic level. It can be used to bring capacitance and inductance values into a range that is convenient to work with.

# 14.9.2 Frequency Scaling

Frequency scaling is the process of shifting the frequency response of a network up or down the frequency axis while leaving the impedance the same.

We achieve frequency scaling by multiplying the frequency by a factor  $K_{f}$  while keeping the impedance the same.

From Eq. (14.78), we see that the impedances of  $L$  and  $C$  are frequency- dependent. If we apply frequency scaling to  $\mathbf{Z}_{L}(\omega)$  and  $\mathbf{Z}_{C}(\omega)$  in Eq. (14.78), we obtain

$$
\begin{array}{r l r l r l}{{\mathbf{Z}_{L}=j(\omega K_{f})L^{\prime}=j\omega L}}&{{}}&{\Rightarrow}&{{}}&{L^{\prime}=K_{f}^{L}}&{{}}\\ {{}}&{{}}&{{}}&{{}}&{{}}&{{}}&{{}}\\ {{\mathbf{Z}_{C}=\frac{1}{j(\omega K_{f})C^{\prime}}=\frac{1}{j\omega C}}}&{{}}&{\Rightarrow}&{{}}&{C^{\prime}=\frac{C}{K_{f}}}&{{}}&{{}}\end{array} \tag{14.82b}
$$

since the impedance of the inductor and capacitor must remain the same after frequency scaling. We notice the following changes in the element values:  $L \to L / K_{f}$  and  $C \to C / K_{f}$ . The value of  $R$  is not affected, since its impedance does not depend on frequency. Thus, in frequency scaling, the new values of the elements and frequency are

$$
\boxed{ \begin{array}{r l}{R^{\prime} = R,} & {\quad L^{\prime} = \frac{L}{K_{f}}}\\ {C^{\prime} = \frac{C}{K_{f}},} & {\quad \omega^{\prime} = K_{f}\omega} \end{array} } \tag{14.83}
$$

Again, if we consider the series or parallel  $RLC$  circuit, for the resonant frequency

$$
\omega_{0}^{\prime} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{L^{\prime}C^{\prime}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{(L / K_{f})(C / K_{f})}} = \frac{K_{f}}{\sqrt{L C}} = K_{f}\omega_{0} \tag{14.84}
$$

and for the bandwidth

$$
B^{\prime} = K_{f}B \tag{14.85}
$$

but the quality factor remains the same  $(Q^{\prime} = Q)$

# 14.9.5 Magnitude and Frequency Scaling

If a circuit is scaled in magnitude and frequency at the same time, then

$$
\boxed{ \begin{array}{r l}{R^{\prime} = K_{m}R,} & {\quad L^{\prime} = \frac{K_{m}}{K_{f}} L}\\ {C^{\prime} = \frac{1}{K_{m}K_{f}} C,} & {\quad \omega^{\prime} = K_{f}\omega} \end{array} } \tag{14.86}
$$

These are more general formulas than those in Eqs. (14.80) and (14.83). We set  $K_{m} = 1$  in Eq. (14.86) when there is no magnitude scaling or  $K_{f} = 1$  when there is no frequency scaling.

A fourth- order Butterworth low- pass filter is shown in Fig. 14.48(a). The filter is designed such that the cutoff frequency  $\omega_{c} = 1$  rad/s. Scale the circuit for a cutoff frequency of  $50\mathrm{kHz}$  using  $10 - \mathrm{k}\Omega$  resistors.

Figure 14.48 For Example 14.14: (a) Normalized Butterworth low-pass filter, (b) scaled version of the same low-pass filter.

# Solution:

If the cutoff frequency is to shift from  $\omega_{c} = 1$  rad/s to  $\omega_{c}^{\prime} = 2\pi (50)$  krad/s, then the frequency scale factor is

$$
K_{f} = \frac{\omega_{c}^{\prime}}{\omega_{c}} = \frac{100\pi\times10^{3}}{1} = \pi \times 10^{5}
$$

Also, if each  $1 - \Omega$  resistor is to be replaced by a  $10 - \mathrm{k}\Omega$  resistor, then the magnitude scale factor must be

$$
K_{m} = \frac{R^{\prime}}{R} = \frac{10\times10^{3}}{1} = 10^{4}
$$

Using Eq. (14.86),

$$
L_{1}^{\prime} = \frac{K_{m}}{K_{f}} L_{1} = \frac{10^{4}}{\pi\times10^{5}} (1.848) = 58.82\mathrm{mH}
$$

$$
L_{2}^{\prime} = \frac{K_{m}}{K_{f}} L_{2} = \frac{10^{4}}{\pi\times10^{5}} (0.765) = 24.35\mathrm{mH}
$$

$$
C_{1}^{\prime} = \frac{C_{1}}{K_{m}K_{f}} = \frac{0.765}{\pi\times10^{9}} = 243.5\mathrm{pF}
$$

$$
C_{2}^{\prime} = \frac{C_{2}}{K_{m}K_{f}} = \frac{1.848}{\pi\times10^{9}} = 588.2\mathrm{pF}
$$

The scaled circuit is shown in Fig. 14.48(b). This circuit uses practical values and will provide the same transfer function as the prototype in Fig. 14.48(a), but shifted in frequency.

A third- order Butterworth filter normalized to  $\omega_{c} = 1$  rad/s is shown in Fig. 14.49. Scale the circuit to a cutoff frequency of  $10\mathrm{kHz}$ . Use  $15 - \mathrm{nF}$  capacitors.

Answer:  $R_{1}^{\prime} = R_{2}^{\prime} = 1.061\mathrm{k}\Omega$ ,  $C_{1}^{\prime} = C_{2}^{\prime} = 15\mathrm{nF}$ ,  $L^{\prime} = 33.77\mathrm{mH}$ .

# 14.10 Frequency Response Using PSpice

14.10 Frequency Response Using PSpicePSpice is a useful tool in the hands of the modern circuit designer for obtaining the frequency response of circuits. The frequency response is obtained using the AC Sweep as discussed in Section D.5 (Appendix D). This requires that we specify in the AC Sweep dialog box Total Pts, Start Freq, End Freq, and the sweep type. Total Pts is the number of points in the frequency sweep, and Start Freq and End Freq are, respectively, the starting and final frequencies, in hertz. In order to know what frequencies to select for Start Freq and End Freq, one must have an idea of the frequency range of interest by making a rough sketch of the frequency response. In a complex circuit where this may not be possible, one may use a trial- and- error approach.There are three types of sweeps:

There are three types of sweeps:

Linear: The frequency is varied linearly from Start Freq to End Freq with Total Pts equally spaced points (or responses).

Octave: The frequency is swept logarithmically by octaves from Start Freq to End Freq with Total Pts per octave. An octave is a factor of 2 (e.g., 2 to 4, 4 to 8, 8 to 16).

Decade: The frequency is varied logarithmically by decades from Start Freq to End Freq with Total Pts per decade. A decade is a factor of 10 (e.g., from 2 to  $20\mathrm{Hz}$  20 to  $200\mathrm{Hz}$ $200\mathrm{Hz}$  to  $2\mathrm{kHz}$  -

It is best to use a linear sweep when displaying a narrow frequency range of interest, as a linear sweep displays the frequency range well in a narrow range. Conversely, it is best to use a logarithmic (octave or decade) sweep for displaying a wide frequency range of interest- if a linear sweep is used for a wide range, all the data will be crowded at the highor low- frequency end and insufficient data at the other end.

With the above specifications, PSpice performs a steady- state sinusoidal analysis of the circuit as the frequency of all the independent sources is varied (or swept) from Start Freq to End Freq.

The PSpice A/D program produces a graphical output. The output data type may be specified in the Trace Command Box by adding one of the following suffixes to  $\mathrm{v}$  or I:

M Amplitude of the sinusoid. P Phase of the sinusoid. dB Amplitude of the sinusoid in decibels, that is,  $20\log_{10}$  (amplitude).

# Solution:

We let the input voltage vs be a sinusoid of amplitude  $1\mathrm{V}$  and phase  $0^{\circ}$  Figure 14.51 is the schematic for the circuit. The capacitor is rotated  $270^{\circ}$  counterclockwise to ensure that pin 1 (the positive terminal) is on top. The voltage marker is inserted to the output voltage across the capacitor. To perform a linear sweep for  $1< f< 1,000\mathrm{Hz}$  with 50 points, we select Analysis/Setup/AC Sweep, DCLICK Linear, type 50 in the Total Pts box, type 1 in the Start Freq box, and type 1000 in the End Freq box. After saving the file, we select Analysis/Simulate to simulate the circuit. If there are no errors, the PSpice A/D window will display the plot of  $\mathrm{V}(\mathrm{C}1:1)$  , which is the same as  $V_{o}$  or  $H(\omega) = V_{o} / 1$  , as shown

Figure 14.55 For Example 14.16.

Use PSpice to generate the gain and phase Bode plots of  $V$  in the circuit of Fig. 14.55.

# Solution:

The circuit treated in Example 14.15 is first- order while the one in this example is second- order. Since we are interested in Bode plots, we use decade frequency sweep for  $300 < f < 3,000 \mathrm{~Hz}$  with 50 points per decade. We select this range because we know that the resonant frequency of the circuit is within the range. Recall that

$$
\omega_{0} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}} = 5 \mathrm{krad / s} \qquad \text{or} \qquad f_{0} = \frac{\omega}{2\pi} = 795.8 \mathrm{~Hz}
$$

After drawing the circuit as in Fig. 14.55, we select Analysis/Setup/AC Sweep, DCLICK Decade, enter 50 in the Total Pts box, 300 as the Start Freq, and 3,000 in the End Freq box. Upon saving the file, we simulate it by selecting Analysis/Simulate. This will automatically bring up the PSpice A/D window and display V(C1:1) if there are no errors. Since we are interested in the Bode plot, we select Trace/Add in the PSpice A/D menu and type dB(V(C1:1)) in the Trace Command box. The result is the Bode magnitude plot in Fig. 14.56(a). For the phase plot, we select

# 14.11 Computation Using MATLAB

MATLAB is a software package that is widely used for engineering computation and simulation. A review of MATLAB is provided in Appendix E for the beginner. This section shows how to use the software to numerically perform most of the operations presented in this chapter and Chapter 15. The key to describing a system in MATLAB is to specify the numerator (num) and denominator (den) of the transfer function of the system. Once this is done, we can use several MATLAB commands to obtain the system's Bode plots (frequency response) and the system's response to a given input.

The command bode produces the Bode plots (both magnitude and phase) of a given transfer function  $H(s)$ . The format of the command is bode (num, den), where num is the numerator of  $H(s)$  and den is its denominator. The frequency range and number of points are automatically selected. For example, consider the transfer function in Example 14.3. It is better to first write the numerator and denominator in polynomial forms.

Thus,

$$
H(s) = \frac{200j\omega}{(j\omega + 2)(j\omega + 10)} = \frac{200s}{s^2 + 12s + 20}, \qquad s = j\omega
$$

Using the following commands, the Bode plots are generated as shown in Fig. 14.59. If necessary, the command logspace can be included to generate a logarithmically spaced frequency and the command semilogx can be used to produce a semilog scale.

>> num = [200 0]; % specify the numerator of H(s)  >> den = [1 12 20]; % specify the denominator of H(s)  >> bode(num, den); % determine and draw Bode plots

The step response  $y(t)$  of a system is the output when the input  $x(t)$  is the unit step function. The command step plots the step response of a system given the numerator and denominator of the transfer function of that system. The time range and number of points are automatically selected. For example, consider a second- order system with the transfer function

$$
H(s) = \frac{12}{s^2 + 3s + 12}
$$

We obtain the step response of the system shown in Fig. 14.60 by using the following commands.

$$
\begin{array}{l l l}{{\mathrm{~\>~n~}}}&{{=}}&{{12;}}\\ {{\mathrm{~\>~d~}}}&{{=}}&{{[1\ 3\ 12];}}\\ {{\mathrm{~\>~s~t~e~p~(~n~,~d~)~};}}&{{}}&{{}}\end{array}
$$

We can verify the plot in Fig. 14.60 by obtaining  $y(t) = x(t) * u(t)$  or  $Y(s) = X(s)H(s)$ .

Figure 14.60 The Step response of  $H(s) = 12 / (s^2 + 3s + 12)$ .

The command lsim is a more general command than step. It calculates the time response of a system to any arbitrary input signal. The format of the command is  $y = \mathbf{lsim}$  (num, den,  $x, t$ ), where  $x(t)$  is the input signal,  $t$  is the time vector, and  $y(t)$  is the output generated. For example, assume a system is described by the transfer function

$$
H(s) = \frac{s + 4}{s^3 + 2s^2 + 5s + 10}
$$

To find the response  $y(t)$  of the system to input  $x(t) = 10e^{- t}u(t)$ , we use the following MATLAB commands. Both the response  $y(t)$  and the input  $x(t)$  are plotted in Fig. 14.61.

>>t  $=$  0:0.02:5;%timevector  $0< t< 5$  with increment 0.02 >>x  $=$  10\*exp(- t); >>num  $=$  [14];  $\geq$  den  $=$  [12510];  $\geq y =$  1sim(num,den,x,t);  $\geq$  plot(t,x,t,y)

# 14.12 Applications

Resonant circuits and filters are widely used, particularly in electronics, power systems, and communications systems. For example, a Notch filter with a cutoff frequency at  $60 \mathrm{~Hz}$  may be used to eliminate the  $60 \mathrm{~Hz}$  power line noise in various communications electronics. Filtering of signals in communications systems is necessary in order to select the desired signal from a host of others in the same range (as in the case of radio receivers discussed next) and also to minimize the effects of noise and interference on the desired signal. In this section, we consider one practical application of resonant circuits and two applications of filters. The focus of each application is not to understand the details of how each device works but to see how the circuits considered in this chapter are applied in the practical devices.

# 14.12.1 Radio Receiver

Series and parallel resonant circuits are commonly used in radio and TV receivers to tune in stations and to separate the audio signal from the radio- frequency carrier wave. As an example, consider the block diagram

of an AM radio receiver shown in Fig. 14.62. Incoming amplitude- modulated radio waves (thousands of them at different frequencies from different broadcasting stations) are received by the antenna. A resonant circuit (or a band- pass filter) is needed to select just one of the incoming waves. The selected signal is very weak and is amplified in stages in order to generate an audible audio- frequency wave. Thus, we have the radiofrequency (RF) amplifier to amplify the selected broadcast signal, the intermediate frequency (IF) amplifier to amplify an internally generated signal based on the RF signal, and the audio amplifier to amplify the audio signal just before it reaches the loudspeaker. It is much easier to amplify the signal at three stages than to build an amplifier to provide the same amplification for the entire band.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-14/63c420e9-9220-47ad-935a-09e6b2aeb2a8/3f854391a80fc7ce3fcd5fe8c65077e2f1e6703f1e335adc45db8ac9bb5d8d92.jpg)  
Figure 14.62 A simplified block diagram of a superheterodyne AM radio receiver.

The type of AM receiver shown in Fig. 14.62 is known as the superheterodyne receiver. In the early development of radio, each amplification stage had to be tuned to the frequency of the incoming signal. This way, each stage must have several tuned circuits to cover the entire AM band (540 to  $1600\mathrm{kHz}$ ). To avoid the problem of having several resonant circuits, modern receivers use a frequency mixer or heterodyne circuit, which always produces the same IF signal (445 kHz) but retains the audio frequencies carried on the incoming signal. To produce the constant IF frequency, the rotors of two separate variable capacitors are mechanically coupled with one another so that they can be rotated simultaneously with a single control; this is called ganged tuning. A local oscillator ganged with the RF amplifier produces an RF signal that is combined with the incoming wave by the frequency mixer to produce an output signal that contains the sum and the difference frequencies of the two signals. For example, if the resonant circuit is tuned to receive an 800- kHz incoming signal, the local oscillator must produce a 1,255- kHz signal, so that the sum (1,255 + 800 = 2,055 kHz) and the difference (1,255 - 800 = 455 kHz) of frequencies are available at the

output of the mixer. However, only the difference,  $455~\mathrm{kHz}$ , is used in practice. This is the only frequency to which all the IF amplifier stages are tuned, regardless of the station dialed. The original audio signal (containing the "intelligence") is extracted in the detector stage. The detector basically removes the IF signal, leaving the audio signal. The audio signal is amplified to drive the loudspeaker, which acts as a transducer converting the electrical signal to sound.

Our major concern here is the tuning circuit for the AM radio receiver. The operation of the FM radio receiver is different from that of the AM receiver discussed here, and in a much different range of frequencies, but the tuning is similar.

The resonant or tuner circuit of an AM radio is portrayed in Fig. 14.63. Given that  $L = 1\mu \mathrm{H}$ , what must be the range of  $C$  to have the resonant frequency adjustable from one end of the AM band to another?

# Solution:

The frequency range for AM broadcasting is 540 to  $1,600\mathrm{kHz}$ . We consider the low and high ends of the band. Since the resonant circuit in Fig. 14.63 is a parallel type, we apply the ideas in Section 14.6. From Eq. (14.44),

$$
\omega_{0} = 2\pi f_{0} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}}
$$

or

$$
C = \frac{1}{4\pi^2f_0^2L}
$$

For the high end of the AM band,  $f_{0} = 1,600\mathrm{kHz}$ , and the corresponding  $C$  is

$$
C_{1} = \frac{1}{4\pi^{2}\times 1,600^{2}\times 10^{6}\times 10^{-6}} = 9.9\mathrm{nF}
$$

For the low end of the AM band,  $f_{0} = 540\mathrm{kHz}$ , and the corresponding  $C$  is

$$
C_{2} = \frac{1}{4\pi^{2}\times 540^{2}\times 10^{6}\times 10^{-6}} = 86.9\mathrm{nF}
$$

Thus,  $C$  must be an adjustable (gang) capacitor varying from 9.9 to  $86.9\mathrm{nF}$ .

For an FM radio receiver, the incoming wave is in the frequency range from 88 to  $108\mathrm{MHz}$ . The tuner circuit is a parallel  $RLC$  circuit with a  $4 - \mu \mathrm{H}$  coil. Calculate the range of the variable capacitor necessary to cover the entire band.

Answer: From 0.543 to  $0.818\mathrm{pF}$ .

The arrangement provides 12 distinct signals by using seven tones divided into two groups: the low- frequency group (697 to  $941\mathrm{Hz}$ ) and the high- frequency group (1,209 to  $1,477\mathrm{Hz}$ ). Pressing a button generates a sum of two sinusoids corresponding to its unique pair of frequencies. For example, pressing the number 6 button generates sinusoidal tones with frequencies 770 and  $1,477\mathrm{Hz}$ .

Figure 14.64Frequency assignments for touch-tone dialing.

When a caller dials a telephone number, a set of signals is transmitted to the telephone office, where the touch- tone signals are decoded by detecting the frequencies they contain. Figure 14.65 shows the block diagram for the detection scheme. The signals are first amplified and separated into their respective groups by the low- pass (LP) and high- pass (HP) filters. The limiters (L) are used to convert the separated tones into square waves. The individual tones are identified using seven band- pass (BP) filters, each filter passing one tone and rejecting other tones. Each filter is followed by a detector (D), which is energized when its input voltage exceeds a certain level. The outputs of the detectors provide the required dc signals needed by the switching system to connect the caller to the party being called.

Figure 14.65 Block diagram of detection scheme.

Using the standard 600- Ω resistor used in telephone circuits and a series  $RLC$  circuit, design the band- pass filter  $BP_{2}$  in Fig. 14.65.

# Solution:

The band- pass filter is the series  $RLC$  circuit in Fig. 14.35. Inasmuch as  $BP_{2}$  passes frequencies 697 to  $852 \mathrm{~Hz}$  and is centered at  $f_{0} = 770 \mathrm{~Hz}$ , its bandwidth is

$$
B = 2\pi (f_{2} - f_{1}) = 2\pi (852 - 697) = 973.89 \mathrm{rad / s}
$$

From Eq. (14.39),

$$
L = \frac{R}{B} = \frac{600}{973.89} = 0.616 \mathrm{H}
$$

From Eq. (14.27) or (14.55),

$$
C = \frac{1}{\omega_{0}^{2}L} = \frac{1}{4\pi^{2}f_{0}^{2}L} = \frac{1}{4\pi^{2}\times 770^{2}\times 0.616} = 69.36 \mathrm{nF}
$$

Repeat Example 14.18 for band- pass filter  $BP_{6}$ .

Answer: 356 mH, 39.83 nF.

# 14.12.3 Crossover Network

Another typical application of filters is the crossover network that couples an audio amplifier to woofer and tweeter speakers, as shown in Fig. 14.66(a). The network basically consists of one high- pass  $RC$  filter

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-14/63c420e9-9220-47ad-935a-09e6b2aeb2a8/0628edc5d587af594e6d663a53bfad449b8d8a0957d16bda2b01f4c4d35a0813.jpg)

Figure 14.67 Frequency responses of the crossover network in Fig. 14.66.

and one low- pass  $RL$  filter. It routes frequencies higher than a prescribed crossover frequency  $f_{c}$  to the tweeter (high- frequency loudspeaker) and frequencies below  $f_{c}$  into the woofer (low- frequency loudspeaker). These loudspeakers have been designed to accommodate certain frequency responses. A woofer is a low- frequency loudspeaker designed to reproduce the lower part of the frequency range, up to about  $3\mathrm{kHz}$ . A tweeter can reproduce audio frequencies from about  $3\mathrm{kHz}$  to about  $20\mathrm{kHz}$ . The two speaker types can be combined to reproduce the entire audio range of interest and provide the optimum in frequency response.

By replacing the amplifier with a voltage source, the approximate equivalent circuit of the crossover network is shown in Fig. 14.66(b), where the loudspeakers are modeled by resistors. As a high- pass filter, the transfer function  $V_{1} / V_{s}$  is given by

$$
H_{1}(\omega) = \frac{V_{1}}{V_{s}} = \frac{j\omega R_{1}C}{1 + j\omega R_{1}C} \tag{14.87}
$$

Similarly, the transfer function of the low- pass filter is given by

$$
H_{2}(\omega) = \frac{V_{2}}{V_{s}} = \frac{R_{2}}{R_{2} + j\omega L} \tag{14.88}
$$

The values of  $R_{1}, R_{2}, L$ , and  $C$  may be selected such that the two filters have the same cutoff frequency, known as the crossover frequency, as shown in Fig. 14.67.

The principle behind the crossover network is also used in the resonant circuit for a TV receiver, where it is necessary to separate the video and audio bands of RF carrier frequencies. The lower- frequency band (picture information in the range from about  $30\mathrm{Hz}$  to about  $4\mathrm{MHz}$ ) is channeled into the receiver's video amplifier, while the high- frequency band (sound information around  $4.5\mathrm{MHz}$ ) is channeled to the receiver's sound amplifier.

In the crossover network of Fig. 14.66, suppose each speaker acts as a  $6 - \Omega$  resistance. Find  $C$  and  $L$  if the crossover frequency is  $2.5\mathrm{kHz}$ .

# Solution:

For the high- pass filter,

$$
\omega_{c} = 2\pi f_{c} = \frac{1}{R_{1}C}
$$

or

$$
C = \frac{1}{2\pi f_{c}R_{1}} = \frac{1}{2\pi\times 2.5\times 10^{3}\times 6} = 10.61~\mu \mathrm{F}
$$

For the low- pass filter,

$$
\omega_{c} = 2\pi f_{c} = \frac{R_{2}}{L}
$$

or

$$
L = \frac{R_{2}}{2\pi f_{c}} = \frac{6}{2\pi\times 2.5\times 10^{3}} = 382\mu \mathrm{H}
$$

If each speaker in Fig. 14.66 has an  $8 - \Omega$  resistance and  $C = 10\mu \mathrm{F}$ , find  $L$  and the crossover frequency.

Answer:  $0.64\mathrm{mH}$ ,  $1.989\mathrm{kHz}$ .

# 14.13 Summary

1. The transfer function  $\mathbf{H}(\omega)$  is the ratio of the output response  $\mathbf{Y}(\omega)$  to the input excitation  $\mathbf{X}(\omega)$ ; that is,  $\mathbf{H}(\omega) = \mathbf{Y}(\omega) / \mathbf{X}(\omega)$ .

2. The frequency response is the variation of the transfer function with frequency.

3. Zeros of a transfer function  $\mathbf{H}(s)$  are the values of  $s = j\omega$  that make  $H(s) = 0$ , while poles are the values of  $s$  that make  $H(s) \to \infty$ .

4. The decibel is the unit of logarithmic gain. For a voltage or current gain  $G$ , its decibel equivalent is  $G_{\mathrm{dB}} = 20\log_{10}G$ .

5. Bode plots are semilog plots of the magnitude and phase of the transfer function as it varies with frequency. The straight-line approximations of  $H$  (in dB) and  $\phi$  (in degrees) are constructed using the corner frequencies defined by the poles and zeros of  $\mathbf{H}(\omega)$ .

6. The resonant frequency is that frequency at which the imaginary part of a transfer function vanishes. For series and parallel  $RLC$  circuits.

$$
\omega_{0} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}}
$$

7. The half-power frequencies  $(\omega_{1},\omega_{2})$  are those frequencies at which the power dissipated is one-half of that dissipated at the resonant frequency. The geometric mean between the half-power frequencies is the resonant frequency, or

$$
\omega_{0} = \sqrt{\omega_{1}\omega_{2}}
$$

8. The bandwidth is the frequency band between half-power frequencies:

$$
B = \omega_{2} - \omega_{1}
$$

9. The quality factor is a measure of the sharpness of the resonance peak. It is the ratio of the resonant (angular) frequency to the bandwidth,

$$
Q = \frac{\omega_0}{B}
$$

10. A filter is a circuit designed to pass a band of frequencies and reject others. Passive filters are constructed with resistors, capacitors, and inductors. Active filters are constructed with resistors, capacitors, and an active device, usually an op amp.

11. Four common types of filters are low-pass, high-pass, band-pass, and band-stop. A low-pass filter passes only signals whose frequencies are below the cutoff frequency  $\omega_{c}$ . A high-pass filter passes only signals whose frequencies are above the cutoff frequency  $\omega_{c}$ . A band-pass filter passes only signals whose frequencies are within a prescribed

range  $(\omega_{1}< \omega < \omega_{2})$  . A band- stop filter passes only signals whose frequencies are outside a prescribed range  $(\omega_{1} > \omega >\omega_{2})$

12. Scaling is the process whereby unrealistic element values are magnitude-scaled by a factor  $K_{m}$  and/or frequency-scaled by a factor  $K_{f}$  to produce realistic values.

$$
R^{\prime} = K_{m}R,\qquad L^{\prime} = \frac{K_{m}}{K_{f}} L,\qquad C^{\prime} = \frac{1}{K_{m}K_{f}} C
$$

13. PSpice can be used to obtain the frequency response of a circuit if a frequency range for the response and the desired number of points within the range are specified in the AC Sweep.

14. The radio receiver—one practical application of resonant circuits—employs a band-pass resonant circuit to tune in one frequency among all the broadcast signals picked up by the antenna.

15. The touch-tone telephone and the crossover network are two typical applications of filters. The touch-tone telephone system employs filters to separate tones of different frequencies to activate electronic switches. The crossover network separates signals in different frequency ranges so that they can be delivered to different devices such as tweeters and woofers in a loudspeaker system.

# Enhancing Your Skills and Your Career

ABET EC 2000 criteria (3. h), "the broad education necessary to understand the impact of engineering solutions in a global and societal context."

As a student, you must make sure you acquire "the broad education necessary to understand the impact of engineering solutions in a global and societal context." To some extent, if you are already enrolled in an ABET- accredited engineering program, then some of the courses you are required to take must meet this criteria. My recommendation is that even if you are in such a program, you look at all the elective courses you take to make sure that you expand your awareness of global issues and societal concerns. The engineers of the future must fully understand that they and their activities affect all of us in one way or another.

# ABET EC 2000 criteria (3.i), "need for, and an ability to engage in life-long learning."

You must be fully aware of and recognize the "need for, and an ability to engage in life- long learning." It almost seems absurd that this need and ability must be stated. Yet, you would be surprised at how many engineers do not really understand this concept. The only way to be really able to keep up with the explosion in technology we are facing now and will be facing in the future is through constant learning. This learning must include nontechnical issues as well as the latest technology in your field.

The best way to keep up with the state of the art in your field is through your colleagues and association with individuals you meet through your technical organization or organizations (especially IEEE). Reading state- of- the- art technical articles is the next best way to stay current.

Pierre Simon Laplace (1749- 1827), a French astronomer and mathematician, first presented the transform that bears his name and its applications to differential equations in 1779.

Born of humble origins in Beaumont- en- Auge, Normandy, France, Laplace became a professor of mathematics at the age of 20. His mathematical abilities inspired the famous mathematician Simeon Poisson, who called Laplace the Isaac Newton of France. He made important contributions in potential theory, probability theory, astronomy, and celestial mechanics. He was widely known for his work, Traite de Mecanique Celeste (Celestial Mechanics), which supplemented the work of Newton on astronomy. The Laplace transform, the subject of this chapter, is named after him.

# Learning Objectives

By using the information and exercises in this chapter you will be able to:

1. Understand the Laplace transform, its importance in circuit analysis, and how to determine the Laplace transform of functions common to circuit analysis. 
2. Understand the properties of the Laplace transform. 
3. Understand the inverse Laplace transform and how to determine its given functions in the s-domain. 
4. Understand the convolution integral and how to use it in the time domain and its equivalence in the s-domain.

# 15.1 Introduction

Our goal in this and the following chapters is to develop techniques for analyzing circuits with a wide variety of inputs and responses. Such circuits are modeled by differential equations whose solutions describe the total response behavior of the circuits. Mathematical methods have been devised to systematically determine the solutions of differential equations. We now introduce the powerful method of Laplace transformation, which involves turning differential equations into algebraic equations, thus greatly facilitating the solution process.

The idea of transformation should be familiar by now. When using phasors for the analysis of circuits, we transform the circuit from the time domain to the frequency or phasor domain. Once we obtain the phasor result, we transform it back to the time domain. The Laplace transform method follows the same process: We use the Laplace transformation to transform the circuit from the time domain to the frequency domain, obtain the solution, and apply the inverse Laplace transform to the result to transform it back to the time domain.

The Laplace transform is significant for a number of reasons. First, it can be applied to a wider variety of inputs than phasor analysis.

Second, it provides an easy way to solve circuit problems involving initial conditions, because it allows us to work with algebraic equations instead of differential equations. Third, the Laplace transform is capable of providing us, in one single operation, the total response of the circuit comprising both the natural and forced responses.

We begin with the definition of the Laplace transform which gives rise to its most essential properties. By examining these properties, we shall see how and why the method works. This also helps us to better appreciate the idea of mathematical transformations. We also consider some properties of the Laplace transform that are very helpful in circuit analysis. We then consider the inverse Laplace transform, transfer functions, and convolution. In this chapter, we will focus on the mechanics of the Laplace transformation. In Chapter 16 we will examine how the Laplace transform is applied in circuit analysis, network stability, and network synthesis.

# 15.2 Definition of the Laplace Transform

Given a function  $f(t)$ , its Laplace transform, denoted by  $F(s)$  or  $\mathcal{L}[f(t)]$  is defined by

$$
\mathcal{L}[f(t)] = F(s) = \int_{0^{-}}^{\infty}f(t)e^{-st}dt \tag{15.1}
$$

where  $s$  is a complex variable given by

$$
s = \sigma +j\omega \tag{15.2}
$$

Because the argument  $st$  of the exponent  $e$  in Eq. (15.1) must be dimensionless, it follows that  $s$  has the dimensions of frequency and units of inverse seconds  $\left(\mathrm{s}^{- 1}\right)$  or "frequency." In Eq. (15.1), the lower limit is specified as  $0^{- }$  to indicate a time just before  $t = 0$ . We use  $0^{- }$  as the lower limit to include the origin and capture any discontinuity of  $f(t)$  at  $t = 0$ ; this will accommodate functions—such as singularity functions—that may be discontinuous at  $t = 0$ .

It should be noted that the integral in Eq. (15.1) is a definite integral with respect to time. Hence, the result of integration is independent of time and only involves the variable "s."

Equation (15.1) illustrates the general concept of transformation. The function  $f(t)$  is transformed into the function  $F(s)$ . Whereas the former function involves  $t$  as its argument, the latter involves  $s$ . We say the transformation is from  $t$ - domain to  $s$ - domain. Given the interpretation of  $s$  as frequency, we arrive at the following description of the Laplace transform:

The Laplace transform is an integral transformation of a function  $f(t)$  from the time domain into the complex frequency domain, giving  $F(s)$ .

When the Laplace transform is applied to circuit analysis, the differential equations represent the circuit in the time domain. The terms in the differential equations take the place of  $f(t)$ . Their Laplace transform, which corresponds to  $F(s)$ , constitutes algebraic equations representing the circuit in the frequency domain.

For an ordinary function  $f(t)$ , the lower limit can be replaced by  $0$ .

We assume in Eq. (15.1) that  $f(t)$  is ignored for  $t< 0$  . To ensure that this is the case, a function is often multiplied by the unit step. Thus,  $f(t)$  is written as  $f(t)u(t)$  or  $f(t)$ $t\geq 0$

The Laplace transform in Eq. (15.1) is known as the one- sided (or unilateral) Laplace transform. The two- sided (or bilateral) Laplace transform is given by

$$
F(s) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f(t)e^{-s t}d t \tag{15.3}
$$

The one- sided Laplace transform in Eq. (15.1), being adequate for our purposes, is the only type of Laplace transform that we will treat in this book.

A function  $f(t)$  may not have a Laplace transform. For  $f(t)$  to have a Laplace transform, the integral in Eq. (15.1) must converge to a finite value. Because  $|e^{j\omega t}| = 1$  for any value of  $t$  the integral converges when

$$
\int_{0}^{\infty}e^{-\sigma t}\left|f(t)\right|d t< \infty \tag{15.4}
$$

for some real value  $\sigma = \sigma_{c}$  . Thus, the region of convergence for the Laplace transform is  $\operatorname {Re}(s) = \sigma >\sigma_{c}$  , as shown in Fig. 15.1. In this region,  $|F(s)|< \infty$  and  $F(s)$  exists.  $F(s)$  is undefined outside the region of convergence. Fortunately, all functions of interest in circuit analysis satisfy the convergence criterion in Eq. (15.4) and have Laplace transforms. Therefore, it is not necessary to specify  $\sigma_{c}$  in what follows.

A companion to the direct Laplace transform in Eq. (15.1) is the inverse Laplace transform given by

Figure 15.1 Region of convergence for the Laplace transform.

$$
\mathcal{L}^{-1}[F(s)] = f(t) = \frac{1}{2\pi j}\int_{\sigma_{1} - j\infty}^{\sigma_{1} + j\infty}F(s)e^{i t}d s \tag{15.5}
$$

where the integration is performed along a straight line  $(\sigma_{1} + j\omega , - \infty <$ $\omega < \infty)$  in the region of convergence,  $\sigma_{1} > \sigma_{c}$  . See Fig. 15.1. The direct application of Eq. (15.5) involves some knowledge about complex analysis beyond the scope of this book. For this reason, we will not use Eq. (15.5) to find the inverse Laplace transform. We will rather use a look- up table, to be developed in Section 15.3. The functions  $f(t)$  and  $F(s)$  are regarded as a Laplace transform pair where

$$
f(t)\qquad \Leftrightarrow \qquad F(s) \tag{15.6}
$$

meaning that there is one- to- one correspondence between  $f(t)$  and  $F(s)$  The following examples derive the Laplace transforms of some important functions.

# Example 15.1

Determine the Laplace transform of each of the following functions:

(a)  $u(t)$  
(b)  $e^{-a t}u(t)$ $a\geq 0$  , and 
(c)  $\delta (t)$

# Solution:

(a) For the unit step function  $u(t)$  , shown in Fig. 15.2(a), the Laplace transform is

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{\mathcal{L}[u(t)]=\int_{0^{-}}^{\infty}1e^{-s t}d t=-\frac{1}{s}e^{-s t}\bigg|_{0}^{\infty}}}\\ {{=-\frac{1}{s}(0)+\frac{1}{s}(1)=\frac{1}{s}}}\end{array} \tag{15.1.1}
$$

(b) For the exponential function, shown in Fig. 15.2(b), the Laplace transform is

$$
\begin{array}{l}{{\mathcal{L}[e^{-a t}u(t)]=\int_{0^{-}}^{\infty}e^{-a t}e^{-s t}d t}}\\ {{\qquad=-\frac{1}{s+a}e^{-(s+a)t}\Big|_{0}^{\infty}=\frac{1}{s+a}}}\end{array} \tag{15.1.2}
$$

(c) For the unit impulse function, shown in Fig. 15.2(c),

$$
\mathcal{L}[\delta (t)] = \int_{0^{-}}^{\infty}\delta (t)e^{-s t}d t = e^{-0} = 1 \tag{15.1.3}
$$

since the impulse function  $\delta (t)$  is zero everywhere except at  $t = 0$ . The sifting property in Eq. (7.33) has been applied in Eq. (15.1.3).

Determine the Laplace transform of  $f(t) = \sin \omega t u(t)$ .

# Solution:

Using Eq. (B.27) in addition to Eq. (15.1), we obtain the Laplace transform of the sine function as

$$
\begin{array}{l}{{ F(s)=\mathcal{L}\left[\sin\omega t\right]=\int_{0}^{\infty}\left(\sin\omega t\right)e^{-s t}d t=\int_{0}^{\infty}\left(\frac{e^{j\omega t}-e^{-j\omega t}}{2j}\right)e^{-s t}d t}}\\ {{\qquad=\frac{1}{2j}\int_{0}^{\infty}(e^{-(s-j\omega)t}-e^{-(s+j\omega)t})d t}}\\ {{\qquad=\frac{1}{2j}\left(\frac{1}{s-j\omega}-\frac{1}{s+j\omega}\right)=\frac{\omega}{s^{2}+\omega^{2}}}}\end{array}
$$

Find the Laplace transform of  $f(t) = 50 \cos (\omega t)u(t)$ . using the exponential representation for the cosine function.

Answer:  $50s / (s^{2} + \omega^{2})$ .

# 15.3 Properties of the Laplace Transform

The properties of the Laplace transform help us to obtain transform pairs without directly using Eq. (15.1) as we did in Examples 15.1 and 15.2. As we derive each of these properties, we should keep in mind the definition of the Laplace transform in Eq. (15.1).

# Linearity

If  $F_{1}(s)$  and  $F_{2}(s)$  are, respectively, the Laplace transforms of  $f_{1}(t)$  and  $f_{2}(t)$ , then

$$
\mathcal{L}[a_{1}f_{1}(t) + a_{2}f_{2}(t)] = a_{1}F_{1}(s) + a_{2}F_{2}(s) \tag{15.7}
$$

where  $a_{1}$  and  $a_{2}$  are constants. Equation 15.7 expresses the linearity property of the Laplace transform. The proof of Eq. (15.7) follows readily from the definition of the Laplace transform in Eq. (15.1).

For example, by the linearity property in Eq. (15.7), we may write

$$
\mathcal{L}[\cos \omega t u(t)] = \mathcal{L}\Big[\frac{1}{2} (e^{j\omega t} + e^{-j\omega t})\Big] = \frac{1}{2}\mathcal{L}[e^{j\omega t}] + \frac{1}{2}\mathcal{L}[e^{-j\omega t}] \tag{15.8}
$$

But from Example 15.1(b),  $\mathcal{L}[e^{- at}] = 1 / (s + a)$ . Hence,

$$
\mathcal{L}[\cos \omega t u(t)] = \frac{1}{2}\Big(\frac{1}{s - j\omega} +\frac{1}{s + j\omega}\Big) = \frac{s}{s^{2} + \omega^{2}} \tag{15.9}
$$

# Scaling

If  $F(s)$  is the Laplace transform of  $f(t)$ , then

$$
\mathcal{L}[f(at)] = \int_{0 - }^{\infty}f(at)e^{-st}dt \tag{15.10}
$$

where  $a$  is a constant and  $a > 0$ . If we let  $x = at$ ,  $dx = a$  dt, then

$$
\mathcal{L}[f(at)] = \int_{0 - }^{\infty}f(x)e^{-x(s / a)}\frac{dx}{a} = \frac{1}{a}\int_{0 - }^{\infty}f(x)e^{-x(s / a)}dx \tag{15.11}
$$

Comparing this integral with the definition of the Laplace transform in Eq. (15.1) shows that  $s$  in Eq. (15.1) must be replaced by  $s / a$  while the dummy variable  $t$  is replaced by  $x$ . Hence, we obtain the scaling property as

$$
\mathcal{L}[f(at)] = \frac{1}{a} F\left(\frac{s}{a}\right) \tag{15.12}
$$

For example, we know from Example 15.2 that

$$
\mathcal{L}[\sin \omega t u(t)] = \frac{\omega}{s^{2} + \omega^{2}} \tag{15.13}
$$

Using the scaling property in Eq. (15.12),

$$
\mathcal{L}[\sin 2\omega t u(t)] = \frac{1}{2}\frac{\omega}{(s / 2)^{2} + \omega^{2}} = \frac{-2\omega}{s^{2} + 4\omega^{2}} \tag{15.14}
$$

which may also be obtained from Eq. (15.13) by replacing  $\omega$  with  $2\omega$ .

# Time Shift

If  $F(s)$  is the Laplace transform of  $f(t)$ , then

$$
\mathcal{L}[f(t - a)u(t - a)] = \int_{0 - }^{\infty}f(t - a)u(t - a)e^{-st}dt \tag{15.15}
$$

a 0

But  $u(t - a) = 0$  for  $t< a$  and  $u(t - a) = 1$  for  $t > a$  . Hence,

$$
\mathcal{L}[f(t - a)u(t - a)] = \int_{a}^{\infty}f(t - a)e^{-s t}d t \tag{15.16}
$$

If we let  $x = t - a$  , then  $d x = d t$  and  $t = x + a$  . As  $t\to a,x\to 0$  and as  $t\to \infty ,x\to \infty$  . Thus,

$$
\begin{array}{r l r}{{\mathcal{L}[f(t-a)u(t-a)]=\int_{0}^{\infty}f(x)e^{-s(x+a)} d x}}\\ &{}&\\ &{}&{=e^{-a s}\int_{0}^{\infty}f(x)e^{-s x} d x=e^{-a s}F(s)}\end{array}
$$

or

$$
\mathcal{L}[f(t - a)u(t - a)] = e^{-a s}F(s) \tag{15.17}
$$

In other words, if a function is delayed in time by  $a$  , the result in the  $s$  - domain is found by multiplying the Laplace transform of the function (without the delay) by  $e^{- a s}$  . This is called the time- delay or time- shift property of the Laplace transform.

As an example, we know from Eq. (15.9) that

$$
\mathcal{L}[\cos \omega t u(t)] = \frac{s}{s^{2} + \omega^{2}}
$$

Using the time- shift property in Eq. (15.17),

$$
\mathcal{L}[\cos \omega (t - a)u(t - a)] = e^{-a s}\frac{s}{s^{2} + \omega^{2}} \tag{15.18}
$$

# Frequency Shift

If  $F(s)$  is the Laplace transform of  $f(t)$  , then

$$
\begin{array}{r l r}{{\mathcal{L}[e^{-a t}f(t)u(t)]=\int_{0}^{\infty}e^{-a t}f(t)e^{-s t}d t}}\\ &{}&\\ &{}&{=\int_{0}^{\infty}f(t)e^{-(s+a)t}d t=F(s+a)}\end{array}
$$

or

$$
\mathcal{L}[e^{-a t}f(t)u(t)] = F(s + a) \tag{15.19}
$$

That is, the Laplace transform of  $e^{- a t} f(t)$  can be obtained from the Laplace transform of  $f(t)$  by replacing every  $s$  with  $s + a$  . This is known as frequency shift or frequency translation.

As an example, we know that

$$
\begin{array}{r l r l}{{\cos\omega t u(t)}}&{{}}&{\Leftrightarrow}&{{}\frac{s}{s^{2}+\omega^{2}}}\\ {{}}&{{}}&{}&{{}}\\ {{\sin\omega t u(t)}}&{{}}&{\Leftrightarrow}&{{}\frac{\omega}{s^{2}+\omega^{2}}}\end{array} \tag{15.20}
$$

Using the shift property in Eq. (15.19), we obtain the Laplace transform of the damped sine and damped cosine functions as

$$
\begin{array}{r}{\mathcal{L}[e^{-a t}\cos \omega t u(t)] = \frac{s + a}{(s + a)^{2} + \omega^{2}}}\\ {\mathcal{L}[e^{-a t}\sin \omega t u(t)] = \frac{\omega}{(s + a)^{2} + \omega^{2}}} \end{array} \tag{15.21b}

Given that  $F(s)$  is the Laplace transform of  $f(t)$ , the Laplace transform of its derivative is

$$
\mathcal{L}\left[\frac{d f}{d t} u(t)\right] = \int_{0^{-}}^{\infty}\frac{d f}{d t} e^{-s t}d t \tag{15.22}
$$

To integrate this by parts, we let  $u = e^{- s t}$ ,  $d u = - s e^{- s t} d t$ , and  $d \nu = \frac{d f}{d t} d t = d f(t)$ ,  $\nu = f(t)$ . Then

$$
\begin{array}{l}{{\mathcal{L}\bigg[\frac{d f}{d t}u(t)\bigg]=f(t)e^{-s t}\bigg|_{0^{-}}^{\infty}-\int_{0^{-}}^{\infty}f(t)[-s e^{-s t}]d t}}\\ {{=0-f(0^{-})+s\int_{0^{-}}^{\infty}f(t)e^{-s t}d t=s F(s)-f(0^{-})}}\end{array}
$$

or

$$
\mathcal{L}[f^{\prime}(t)] = s F(s) - f(0^{-}) \tag{15.23}
$$

The Laplace transform of the second derivative of  $f(t)$  is a repeated application of Eq. (15.23) as

$$
\begin{array}{r l} & {\mathcal{L}\bigg[\frac{d^{2}f}{d t^{2}}\bigg] = s\mathcal{L}[f^{\prime}(t)] - f^{\prime}(0^{-}) = s[s F(s) - f(0^{-})] - f^{\prime}(0^{-})}\\ & {\qquad = s^{2}F(s) - s f(0^{-}) - f^{\prime}(0^{-})} \end{array}
$$

or

$$
\mathcal{L}[f^{\prime \prime}(t)] = s^{2}F(s) - s f(0^{-}) - f^{\prime}(0^{-}) \tag{15.24}
$$

Continuing in this manner, we can obtain the Laplace transform of the  $n$ th derivative of  $f(t)$  as

$$
\begin{array}{r l} & {\mathcal{L}\bigg[\frac{d^{n}f}{d t^{n}}\bigg] = s^{n}F(s) - s^{n - 1}f(0^{-})}\\ & {\qquad -s^{n - 2}f^{\prime}(0^{-}) - \dots -s^{0}f^{(n - 1)}(0^{-})} \end{array} \tag{15.25}
$$

As an example, we can use Eq. (15.23) to obtain the Laplace transform of the sine from that of the cosine. If we let  $f(t) = \cos \omega t u(t)$ , then  $f(0) = 1$  and  $f^{\prime}(t) = - \omega \sin \omega t u(t)$ . Using Eq. (15.23) and the scaling property,

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{\mathcal{L}[\sin\omega t u(t)]=-\frac{1}{\omega}\mathcal{L}[f^{\prime}(t)]=-\frac{1}{\omega}[s F(s)-f(0^{-})]}}\\ {{=-\frac{1}{\omega}\Big(s^{2}+\omega^{2}-1\Big)=\frac{\omega}{s^{2}+\omega^{2}}}}\end{array} \tag{15.26}
$$

as expected.

# Time Integration

If  $F(s)$  is the Laplace transform of  $f(t)$ , the Laplace transform of its integral is

$$
\mathcal{L}\left[\int_{0}^{t}f(x)d x\right] = \int_{0^{-}}^{\infty}\left[\int_{0}^{t}f(x)d x\right]e^{-s t}d t \tag{15.27}
$$

To integrate this by parts, we let

$$
u = \int_{0}^{t}f(x)d x,\qquad d u = f(t)d t
$$

and

$$
d\nu = e^{-s t}d t,\qquad \nu = -\frac{1}{s} e^{-s t}
$$

Then

$$
\begin{array}{r l r} & {} & {\mathcal{L}\Big[\int_{0}^{t}f(x)d x\Big] = \Big[\int_{0}^{t}f(x)d x\Big]\Big(-\frac{1}{s} e^{-s t}\Big)\Big|_{0}^{\infty}}\\ & {} & {-\int_{0}^{\infty}\Big(-\frac{1}{s}\Big)e^{-s t}f(t)d t} \end{array}
$$

For the first term on the right- hand side of the equation, evaluating the term at  $t = \infty$  yields zero due to  $e^{- s\infty}$  and evaluating it at  $t = 0$  gives  $\frac{1}{s}\int_{0}^{0}f(x) dx = 0$ . Thus, the first term is zero, and

$$
\mathcal{L}\left[\int_{0}^{t}f(x)d x\right] = \frac{1}{s}\int_{0}^{t}f(t)e^{-s t}d t = \frac{1}{s} F(s)
$$

or simply,

$$
\mathcal{L}\left[\int_{0}^{t}f(x)d x\right] = \frac{1}{s} F(s) \tag{15.28}
$$

As an example, if we let  $f(t) = u(t)$ , from Example 15.1(a),  $F(s) = 1 / s$ . Using Eq. (15.28),

$$
\mathcal{L}\left[\int_{0}^{t}f(x)d x\right] = \mathcal{L}[t] = \frac{1}{s}\left(\frac{1}{s}\right)
$$

Thus, the Laplace transform of the ramp function is

$$
\mathcal{L}[t] = \frac{1}{s^{2}} \tag{15.29}
$$

Applying Eq. (15.28), this gives

$$
\mathcal{L}\left[\int_{0}^{t}x d x\right] = \mathcal{L}\left[\frac{t^{2}}{2}\right] = \frac{1}{s}\frac{1}{s^{2}}
$$

or

$$
\mathcal{L}[t^{2}] = \frac{2}{s^{3}} \tag{15.30}
$$

Repeated applications of Eq. (15.28) lead to

$$
\mathcal{L}[t^{n}] = \frac{n!}{s^{n + 1}} \tag{15.31}
$$

Similarly, using integration by parts, we can show that

$$
\mathcal{L}\left[\int_{-\infty}^{t}f(x)dx\right] = \frac{1}{s} F(s) + \frac{1}{s} f^{-1}(0^{-}) \tag{15.32}
$$

where

$$
f^{-1}(0^{-}) = \int_{-\infty}^{0^{-}}f(t)dt
$$

# Frequency Differentiation

If  $F(s)$  is the Laplace transform of  $f(t)$ , then

$$
F(s) = \int_{0^{-}}^{\infty}f(t)e^{-st}dt
$$

Taking the derivative with respect to  $s$

$$
\frac{dF(s)}{ds} = \int_{0^{-}}^{\infty}f(t)(-te^{-st})dt = \int_{0^{-}}^{\infty}(-tf(t))e^{-st}dt = \mathcal{L}[-tf(t)]
$$

and the frequency differentiation property becomes

$$
\mathcal{L}[tf(t)] = -\frac{dF(s)}{ds} \tag{15.33}
$$

Repeated applications of this equation lead to

$$
\mathcal{L}[t^{n}f(t)] = (-1)^{n}\frac{d^{n}F(s)}{ds^{n}} \tag{15.34}
$$

For example, we know from Example 15.1(b) that  $\mathcal{L}[e^{- at}] = 1 / (s + a)$ . Using the property in Eq. (15.33),

$$
\mathcal{L}[te^{-at}u(t)] = -\frac{d}{ds}\left(\frac{1}{s + a}\right) = \frac{1}{(s + a)^2} \tag{15.35}
$$

Figure 15.4 Decomposition of the periodic function in Fig. 15.3.

Note that if  $a = 0$ , we obtain  $\mathcal{L}[t] = 1 / s^2$  as in Eq. (15.29), and repeated applications of Eq. (15.33) will yield Eq. (15.31).

# Time Periodicity

If function  $f(t)$  is a periodic function such as shown in Fig. 15.3, it can be represented as the sum of time- shifted functions shown in Fig. 15.4. Thus,

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{f(t)=f_{1}(t)+f_{2}(t)+f_{3}(t)+\cdots}}\\ {{=f_{1}(t)+f_{1}(t-T)u(t-T)}}\\ {{+f_{1}(t-2T)u(t-2T)+\cdots}}\end{array} \tag{15.36}
$$

where  $f_{1}(t)$  is the same as the function  $f(t)$  gated over the interval  $0 < t < T$ , that is,

$$
f_{1}(t) = f(t)[u(t) - u(t - T)] \tag{15.37a}
$$

or

$$
f_{1}(t)={\left\{\begin{array}{l l}{f(t),}&{0< t< T}\\ {0,}&{{\mathrm{otherwise}}}\end{array}\right.} \tag{15.37b}
$$

We now transform each term in Eq. (15.36) and apply the time- shift property in Eq. (15.17). We obtain

$$
\begin{array}{r l} & {F(s) = F_{1}(s) + F_{1}(s)e^{-T s} + F_{1}(s)e^{-2T s} + F_{1}(s)e^{-3T s} + \dots}\\ & {\quad = F_{1}(s)[1 + e^{-T s} + e^{-2T s} + e^{-3T s} + \dots ]} \end{array} \tag{15.38}
$$

But

$$
1 + x + x^{2} + x^{3} + \dots = \frac{1}{1 - x} \tag{15.39}
$$

if  $\left|x\right|< 1$  .Hence,

$$
F(s) = \frac{F_{1}(s)}{1 - e^{-T s}} \tag{15.40}
$$

where  $F_{1}(s)$  is the Laplace transform of  $f_{1}(t)$  ; in other words,  $F_{1}(s)$  is the transform  $f(t)$  defined over its first period only. Equation (15.40) shows that the Laplace transform of a periodic function is the transform of the first period of the function divided by  $1 - e^{- T s}$

# Initial and Final Values

The initial- value and final- value properties allow us to find the initial value  $f(0)$  and the final value  $f(\infty)$  of  $f(t)$  directly from its Laplace transform  $F(s)$  . To obtain these properties, we begin with the differentiation property in Eq. (15.23), namely,

$$
s F(s) - f(0) = \mathcal{L}\bigg[\frac{d f}{d t}\bigg] = \int_{0^{-}}^{\infty}\frac{d f}{d t} e^{-s t}d t \tag{15.41}
$$

If we let  $s\rightarrow \infty$  , the integrand in Eq. (15.41) vanishes due to the damping exponential factor, and Eq. (15.41) becomes

$$
\lim_{s\to \infty}[s F(s) - f(0)] = 0
$$

Because  $f(0)$  is independent of  $s$  , we can write

$$
f(0) = \lim_{s\to \infty}s F(s) \tag{15.42}
$$

This is known as the initial- value theorem. For example, we know from Eq. (15.21a) that

$$
f(t) = e^{-2t}\cos 10t u(t)\qquad \Leftrightarrow \qquad F(s) = \frac{s + 2}{(s + 2)^{2} + 10^{2}} \tag{15.43}
$$

Using the initial- value theorem,

$$
\begin{array}{r l r}{{f(0)=\lim _{s\to\infty}s F(s)=\lim _{s\to\infty}\frac{s^{2}+2s}{s^{2}+4s+104}}}\\ &{}&{=\lim _{s\to\infty}\frac{1+2/s}{1+4/s+104/s^{2}}=1}\end{array}
$$

which confirms what we would expect from the given  $f(t)$

In Eq. (15.41), we let  $s \to 0$ ; then

$$
\lim_{s\to 0}[s F(s) - f(0^{-})] = \int_{0^{-}}^{\infty}\frac{d f}{d t} e^{0t}d t = \int_{0^{-}}^{\infty}d f = f(\infty) - f(0^{-})
$$

or

$$
\boxed{f(\infty) = \lim_{s\to 0}s F(s)} \tag{15.44}
$$

This is referred to as the final- value theorem. In order for the final- value theorem to hold, all poles of  $F(s)$  must be located in the left half of the  $s$  plane (see Fig. 15.1 or 15.9); that is, the poles must have negative real parts. The only exception to this requirement is the case in which  $F(s)$  has a simple pole at  $s = 0$ , because the effect of  $1 / s$  will be nullified by  $s F(s)$  in Eq. (15.44). For example, from Eq. (15.21b),

$$
f(t) = e^{-s t}\sin 5t u(t)\qquad \Leftrightarrow \qquad F(s) = \frac{5}{(s + 2)^{2} + 5^{2}} \tag{15.45}
$$

Applying the final- value theorem,

$$
f(\infty) = \lim_{s\to 0}s F(s) = \lim_{s\to 0}\frac{5s}{s^{2} + 4s + 29} = 0
$$

as expected from the given  $f(t)$ . As another example,

$$
f(t) = \sin t u(t)\qquad \Leftrightarrow \qquad f(s) = \frac{1}{s^{2} + 1} \tag{15.46}
$$

so that

$$
f(\infty) = \lim_{s\to 0}s F(s) = \lim_{s\to 0}\frac{s}{s^{2} + 1} = 0
$$

This is incorrect, because  $f(t) = \sin t$  oscillates between  $+1$  and  $- 1$  and does not have a limit as  $t \to \infty$ . Thus, the final- value theorem cannot be used to find the final value of  $f(t) = \sin t$ , because  $F(s)$  has poles at  $s = \pm j$ , which are not in the left half of the  $s$  plane. In general, the final- value theorem does not apply in finding the final values of sinusoidal functions—these functions oscillate forever and do not have final values.

The initial- value and final- value theorems depict the relationship between the origin and infinity in the time domain and the  $s$ - domain. They serve as useful checks on Laplace transforms.

Table 15.1 provides a list of the properties of the Laplace transform. The last property (on convolution) will be proved in Section 15.5. There are other properties, but these are enough for present purposes. Table 15.2 summarizes the Laplace transforms of some common functions. We have omitted the factor  $u(t)$  except where it is necessary.

We should mention that many software packages, such as Mathcad, MATLAB, Maple, and Mathematica, offer symbolic math. For example, Mathcad has symbolic math for the Laplace, Fourier, and  $Z$  transforms as well as the inverse function.

Find the Laplace transform of the function  $h(t)$  in Fig. 15.6.

Answer:  $\frac{10}{s} (2 - e^{- 4s} - e^{- 8s})$ .

Calculate the Laplace transform of the periodic function in Fig. 15.7.

# Solution:

The period of the function is  $T = 2$ . To apply Eq. (15.40), we first obtain the transform of the first period of the function.

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{f_{1}(t)=2[u(t)-u(t-1)]=2t u(t)-2t u(t-1)}}\\ {{{}}}\\ {{=2t u(t)-2(t-1+1)u(t-1)}}\\ {{{}}}\\ {{=2t u(t)-2(t-1)u(t-1)-2u(t-1)}}\end{array}
$$

Using the time- shift property,

$$
F_{1}(s) = \frac{2}{s^{2}} -\frac{2}{s^{2}} e^{-s} - \frac{2}{s} e^{-s} = \frac{2}{s^{2}} (1 - e^{-s} - s e^{-s})
$$

Thus, the transform of the periodic function in Fig. 15.7 is

$$

Find the initial and final values of the function whose Laplace transform is

$$
H(s) = \frac{20}{(s + 3)(s^{2} + 8s + 25)}
$$

# Solution:

Applying the initial- value theorem,

$$
h(0) = \lim_{s\to \infty}s H(s) = \lim_{s\to \infty}\frac{20s}{(s + 3)(s^{2} + 8s + 25)}
$$

$$

$$

To be sure that the final- value theorem is applicable, we check where the poles of  $H(s)$  are located. The poles of  $H(s)$  are  $s = - 3, - 4 \pm j3$ , which all have negative real parts: They are all located on the left half of the  $s$  plane (Fig. 15.9). Hence, the final- value theorem applies and

$$

# 15.4 The Inverse Laplace Transform

Given  $F(s)$ , how do we transform it back to the time domain and obtain the corresponding  $f(t)$ ? By matching entries in Table 15.2, we avoid using Eq. (15.5) to find  $f(t)$ .

Suppose  $F(s)$  has the general form of

$$
F(s) = \frac{N(s)}{D(s)} \tag{15.47}
$$

where  $N(s)$  is the numerator polynomial and  $D(s)$  is the denominator polynomial. The roots of  $N(s) = 0$  are called the zeros of  $F(s)$ , while the roots of  $D(s) = 0$  are the poles of  $F(s)$ . Although Eq. (15.47) is similar in form to Eq. (14.3), here  $F(s)$  is the Laplace transform of a function, which is not necessarily a transfer function. We use partial fraction expansion to break  $F(s)$  down into simple terms whose inverse transform we obtain from Table 15.2. Thus, finding the inverse Laplace transform of  $F(s)$  involves two steps.

Steps to Find the Inverse Laplace Transform:

1. Decompose  $F(s)$  into simple terms using partial fraction expansion.

2. Find the inverse of each term by matching entries in Table 15.2.

Let us consider the three possible forms  $F(s)$  may take and how to apply the two steps to each form.

# 15.4.1 Simple Poles

Recall from Chapter 14 that a simple pole is a first- order pole. If  $F(s)$  has only simple poles, then  $D(s)$  becomes a product of factors, so that

Otherwise, we must first apply long division so that  $F(s) = N(s) / D(s) = Q(s) + R(s) / D(s)$ , where the degree of  $R(s)$ , the remainder of the long division, is less than the degree of  $D(s)$ .

$$
F(s) = \frac{N(s)}{(s + p_{1})(s + p_{2})\cdots(s + p_{n})} \tag{15.48}
$$

where  $s = - p_{1}, - p_{2}, \ldots , - p_{n}$  are the simple poles, and  $p_{i} \neq p_{j}$  for all  $i \neq j$  (i.e., the poles are distinct). Assuming that the degree of  $N(s)$  is

less than the degree of  $D(s)$ , we use partial fraction expansion to decompose  $F(s)$  in Eq. (15.48) as

$$
F(s) = \frac{k_{1}}{s + p_{1}} +\frac{k_{2}}{s + p_{2}} +\dots +\frac{k_{n}}{s + p_{n}} \tag{15.49}
$$

The expansion coefficients  $k_{1}, k_{2}, \ldots , k_{n}$  are known as the residues of  $F(s)$ . There are many ways of finding the expansion coefficients. One way is using the residue method. If we multiply both sides of Eq. (15.49) by  $(s + p_{1})$ , we obtain

$$
(s + p_{1})F(s) = k_{1} + \frac{(s + p_{1})k_{2}}{s + p_{2}} +\dots +\frac{(s + p_{1})k_{n}}{s + p_{n}} \tag{15.50}
$$

Because  $p_{i} \neq p_{j}$ , setting  $s = - p_{1}$  in Eq. (15.50) leaves only  $k_{1}$  on the right- hand side of Eq. (15.50). Hence,

$$
(s + p_{1})F(s)\big|_{s = -p_{1}} = k_{1} \tag{15.51}
$$

Thus, in general,

$$
k_{i} = (s + p_{i})F(s)\big|_{s = -p_{i}} \tag{15.52}
$$

This is known as Heaviside's theorem. Once the values of  $k_{i}$  are known, we proceed to find the inverse of  $F(s)$  using Eq. (15.49). Since the inverse transform of each term in Eq. (15.49) is  $\mathcal{L}^{- 1}[k / (s + a)] = k e^{- at} u(t)$ , then, from Table 15.2,

$$
f(t) = (k_{1}e^{-p_{1}t} + k_{2}e^{-p_{2}t} + \dots +k_{n}e^{-p_{n}t})u(t) \tag{15.53}
$$

# 15.4.2 Repeated Poles

Suppose  $F(s)$  has  $n$  repeated poles at  $s = - p$ . Then we may represent  $F(s)$  as

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{F(s)=\frac{k_{n}}{(s+p)^{n}}+\frac{k_{n-1}}{(s+p)^{n-1}}+\cdots+\frac{k_{2}}{(s+p)^{2}}}}\\ {{+\frac{k_{1}}{s+p}+F_{1}(s)}}\end{array} \tag{15.54}
$$

where  $F_{1}(s)$  is the remaining part of  $F(s)$  that does not have a pole at  $s = - p$ . We determine the expansion coefficient  $k_{n}$  as

$$
k_{n} = (s + p)^{n}F(s)\big|_{s = -p} \tag{15.55}
$$

as we did above. To determine  $k_{n - 1}$ , we multiply each term in Eq. (15.54) by  $(s + p)^{n}$  and differentiate to get rid of  $k_{n}$ , then evaluate the result at  $s = - p$  to get rid of the other coefficients except  $k_{n - 1}$ . Thus, we obtain

$$
k_{n - 1} = \frac{d}{ds} [(s + p)^{n}F(s)]\big|_{s = -p} \tag{15.56}
$$

Repeating this gives

$$
k_{n - 2} = \frac{1}{2!}\frac{d^{2}}{ds^{2}} [(s + p)^{n}F(s)]\big|_{s = -p} \tag{15.57}
$$

Historical note: Named after Oliver Heaviside (1850- 1925), an English engineer, the pioneer of operational calculus.

The mth term becomes

$$
k_{n - m} = \frac{1}{m!}\frac{d^{m}}{d s^{m}} [(s + p)^{n}F(s)]\big|_{s = -p} \tag{15.58}
$$

where  $m = 1,2,\ldots ,n - 1$  . One can expect the differentiation to be difficult to handle as  $m$  increases. Once we obtain the values of  $k_{1},k_{2},\ldots ,k_{n}$  by partial fraction expansion, we apply the inverse transform

$$
\mathcal{L}^{-1}\bigg[\frac{1}{(s + a)^{n}}\bigg] = \frac{t^{n - 1}e^{-a t}}{(n - 1)!} u(t) \tag{15.59}
$$

to each term on the right- hand side of Eq. (15.54) and obtain

$$
\begin{array}{l}{{f(t)=\biggl(k_{1}e^{-p t}+k_{2}t e^{-p t}+\frac{k_{3}}{2!}t^{2}e^{-p t}}}\\ {{+\cdots+\frac{k_{n}}{(n-1)!}t^{n-1}e^{-p t}\biggr)u(t)+f_{1}(t)}}\end{array} \tag{15.60}
$$

# 15.4.3 Complex Poles

A pair of complex poles is simple if it is not repeated; it is a double or multiple pole if repeated. Simple complex poles may be handled the same way as simple real poles, but because complex algebra is involved the result is always cumbersome. An easier approach is a method known as completing the square. The idea is to express each complex pole pair (or quadratic term) in  $D(s)$  as a complete square such as  $(s + \alpha)^{2} + \beta^{2}$  and then use Table 15.2 to find the inverse of the term.

Because  $N(s)$  and  $D(s)$  always have real coefficients and we know that the complex roots of polynomials with real coefficients must occur in conjugate pairs,  $F(s)$  may have the general form

$$
F(s) = \frac{A_{1}s + A_{2}}{s^{2} + a s + b} +F_{1}(s) \tag{15.61}
$$

where  $F_{1}(s)$  is the remaining part of  $F(s)$  that does not have this pair of complex poles. If we complete the square by letting

$$
s^{2} + a s + b = s^{2} + 2a s + \alpha^{2} + \beta^{2} = (s + \alpha)^{2} + \beta^{2} \tag{15.62}
$$

and we also let

$$
A_{1}s + A_{2} = A_{1}(s + \alpha) + B_{1}\beta \tag{15.63}
$$

then Eq. (15.61) becomes

$$
F(s) = \frac{A_{1}(s + \alpha)}{(s + \alpha)^{2} + \beta^{2}} +\frac{B_{1}\beta}{(s + \alpha)^{2} + \beta^{2}} +F_{1}(s) \tag{15.64}
$$

From Table 15.2, the inverse transform is

$$
f(t) = (A_{1}e^{-\alpha t}\cos \beta t + B_{1}e^{-\alpha t}\sin \beta t)u(t) + f_{1}(t) \tag{15.65}
$$

The sine and cosine terms can be combined using Eq. (9.11).

Whether the pole is simple, repeated, or complex, a general approach that can always be used in finding the expansion coefficients

is the method of algebra, illustrated in Examples 15.9 to 15.11. To apply the method, we first set  $F(s) = N(s) / D(s)$  equal to an expansion containing unknown constants. We multiply the result through by a common denominator. Then we determine the unknown constants by equating coefficients (i.e., by algebraically solving a set of simultaneous equations for these coefficients at like powers of  $s$ ).

Another general approach is to substitute specific, convenient values of  $s$  to obtain as many simultaneous equations as the number of unknown coefficients, and then solve for the unknown coefficients. We must make sure that each selected value of  $s$  is not one of the poles of  $F(s)$ . Example 15.11 illustrates this idea.

Find the inverse Laplace transform of

$$
F(s) = \frac{3}{s} - \frac{5}{s + 1} + \frac{6}{s^2 + 4}
$$

# Solution:

The inverse transform is given by

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{f(t)=\mathcal{L}^{-1}[F(s)]=\mathcal{L}^{-1}\bigg(\frac{3}{s}\bigg)-\mathcal{L}^{-1}\bigg(\frac{5}{s+1}\bigg)+\mathcal{L}^{-1}\bigg(\frac{6}{s^{2}+4}\bigg)}}\\ {{=(3-5e^{-t}+3\sin2t)u(t),\qquad t\geq0}}\end{array}
$$

where Table 15.2 has been consulted for the inverse of each term.

Determine the inverse Laplace transform of

Practice Problem 15.8

$$
F(s) = 5 + \frac{6}{s + 4} - \frac{7s}{s^2 + 25}
$$

Answer:  $5\delta (t) + (6e^{- 4t} - 7\cos (5t))u(t)$ .

Find  $f(t)$  given that

$$
F(s) = \frac{s^2 + 12}{s(s + 2)(s + 3)}
$$

# Solution:

Unlike in the previous example where the partial fractions have been provided, we first need to determine the partial fractions. Given that there are three poles, we let

$$
\frac{s^2 + 12}{s(s + 2)(s + 3)} = \frac{A}{s} + \frac{B}{s + 2} + \frac{C}{s + 3} \tag{15.9.1}
$$

where  $A$ ,  $B$ , and  $C$  are the constants to be determined. We can find the constants using two approaches.

# METHOD 1 Residue method:

$$
A = sF(s)\big|_{s = 0} = \frac{s^{2} + 12}{(s + 2)(s + 3)}\bigg|_{s = 0} = \frac{12}{(2)(3)} = 2
$$

$$
B = (s + 2)F(s)\big|_{s = -2} = \frac{s^{2} + 12}{s(s + 3)}\bigg|_{s = -2} = \frac{4 + 12}{(-2)(1)} = -8
$$

$$
C = (s + 3)F(s)\big|_{s = -3} = \frac{s^{2} + 12}{s(s + 2)}\bigg|_{s = -3} = \frac{9 + 12}{(-3)(-1)} = 7
$$

METHOD 2 Algebraic method: Multiplying both sides of Eq. (15.9.1) by  $s(s + 2)(s + 3)$  gives

$$
s^{2} + 12 = A(s + 2)(s + 3) + B s(s + 3) + C s(s + 2)
$$

or

$$
s^{2} + 12 = A(s^{2} + 5s + 6) + B(s^{2} + 3s) + C(s^{2} + 2s)
$$

Equating the coefficients of like powers of  $s$  gives

$$
\begin{array}{l l l l}{{\mathrm{Constant:}}}&{{12=6A}}&{{\Rightarrow}}&{{A=2}}\\ {{s:}}&{{0=5A+3B+2C}}&{{\Rightarrow}}&{{3B+2C=-10}}\\ {{s^{2}:}}&{{1=A+B+C}}&{{\Rightarrow}}&{{B+C=-1}}\end{array}
$$

Thus,  $A = 2,B = - 8,C = 7$  , and Eq. (15.9.1) becomes

$$
F(s) = \frac{2}{s} -\frac{8}{s + 2} +\frac{7}{s + 3}
$$

By finding the inverse transform of each term, we obtain

$$
f(t) = (2 - 8e^{-2t} + 7e^{-3t})u(t)
$$

Practice Problem 15.9 Find  $f(t)$  if

$$
F(s) = \frac{6(s + 2)}{(s + 1)(s + 3)(s + 4)}
$$

Answer:  $f(t) = (e^{- t} + 3e^{- 3t} - 4e^{- 4t})u(t).$

# Example 15.10

Calculate  $\nu (t)$  given that

$$
V(s) = \frac{10s^{2} + 4}{s(s + 1)(s + 2)^{2}}
$$

# Solution:

While the previous example is on simple roots, this example is on repeated roots. Let

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{V(s)=\frac{10s^{2}+4}{s(s+1)(s+2)^{2}}}}\\ {{=\frac{A}{s}+\frac{B}{s+1}+\frac{C}{(s+2)^{2}}+\frac{D}{s+2}}}\end{array} \tag{15.10.1}
$$

# METHOD 1 Residue method:

$$
A = sV(s)\left|_{s = 0} = \frac{10s^{2} + 4}{(s + 1)(s + 2)^{2}}\right|_{s = 0} = \frac{4}{(1)(2)^{2}} = 1
$$

$$
B = (s + 1)V(s)\left|_{s = -1} = \frac{10s^{2} + 4}{s(s + 2)^{2}}\right|_{s = -1} = \frac{14}{(-1)(1)^{2}} = -14
$$

$$
C = (s + 2)^{2}V(s)\left|_{s = -2} = \frac{10s^{2} + 4}{s(s + 1)}\right|_{s = -2} = \frac{44}{(-2)(-1)} = 22
$$

$$
D = \frac{d}{ds} [(s + 2)^{2}V(s)]\bigg|_{s = -2} = \frac{d}{ds}\bigg(\frac{10s^{2} + 4}{s^{2} + s}\bigg)\bigg|_{s = -2}
$$

$$
= \frac{(s^{2} + s)(20s) - (10s^{2} + 4)(2s + 1)}{(s^{2} + s)^{2}}\bigg|_{s = -2} = \frac{52}{4} = 13
$$

METHOD 2 Algebraic method: Multiplying Eq. (15.10.1) by  $s(s + 1)(s + 2)^{2}$ , we obtain

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{10s^{2}+4=A(s+1)(s+2)^{2}+B s(s+2)^{2}}}\\ {{+C s(s+1)+D s(s+1)(s+2)}}\end{array}
$$

or

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{10s^{2}+4=A(s^{3}+5s^{2}+8s+4)+B(s^{3}+4s^{2}+4s)}}\\ {{+C(s^{2}+s)+D(s^{3}+3s^{2}+2s)}}\end{array}
$$

Equating coefficients,

$$
\begin{array}{c c c c}{{\mathrm{Constant:}}}&{{4=4A}}&{{\Rightarrow}}&{{A=1}}\\ {{}}&{{}}&{{}}&{{}}\\ {{s:}}&{{0=8A+4B+C+2D}}&{{\Rightarrow}}&{{4B+C+2D=-8}}\\ {{}}&{{}}&{{}}&{{}}\\ {{s^{2}:}}&{{10=5A+4B+C+3D}}&{{\Rightarrow}}&{{4B+C+3D=5}}\\ {{}}&{{}}&{{}}&{{}}\\ {{s^{3}:}}&{{0=A+B+D}}&{{\Rightarrow}}&{{B+D=-1}}\end{array}
$$

Solving these simultaneous equations gives  $A = 1$ ,  $B = - 14$ ,  $C = 22$ ,  $D = 13$ , so that

$$
V(s) = \frac{1}{s} - \frac{14}{s + 1} + \frac{13}{s + 2} + \frac{22}{(s + 2)^{2}}
$$

Taking the inverse transform of each term, we get

$$
\nu (t) = (1 - 14e^{-t} + 13e^{-2t} + 22te^{-2t})u(t)
$$

Obtain  $g(t)$  if

Practice Problem 15.10

$$
G(s) = \frac{s^{3} + 2s + 6}{s(s + 1)^{2}(s + 3)}
$$

Answer:  $(2 - 3.25e^{- t} - 1.5te^{- t} + 2.25e^{- 3t})u(t)$ .

Find the inverse transform of the frequency- domain function in Example 15.7:

$$
H(s) = \frac{20}{(s + 3)(s^{2} + 8s + 25)}
$$

# Solution:

In this example,  $H(s)$  has a pair of complex poles at  $s^{2} + 8s + 25 = 0$  or  $s = - 4\pm j3$  . We let

$$
H(s) = \frac{20}{(s + 3)(s^{2} + 8s + 25)} = \frac{A}{s + 3} +\frac{B s + C}{(s^{2} + 8s + 25)} \tag{15.11.1}
$$

We now determine the expansion coefficients in two ways.

METHOD 1 Combination of methods: We can obtain  $A$  using the method of residue,

$$
A = (s + 3)H(s)\left|_{s = -3} = \frac{20}{s^{2} + 8s + 25}\right|_{s = -3} = \frac{20}{10} = 2
$$

Although  $B$  and  $C$  can be obtained using the method of residue, we will not do so, to avoid complex algebra. Rather, we can substitute two specific values of  $s$  [say  $s = 0$  , 1, which are not poles of  $F(s)]$  into Eq. (15.11.1). This will give us two simultaneous equations from which to find  $B$  and  $C$  . If we let  $s = 0$  in Eq. (15.11.1), we obtain

$$
{\frac{20}{75}}={\frac{A}{3}}+{\frac{C}{25}}
$$

or

$$
20 = 25A + 3C \tag{15.11.2}
$$

Because  $A = 2$  , Eq. (15.11.2) gives  $C = - 10$  . Substituting  $s = 1$  into Eq. (15.11.1) gives

$$
{\frac{20}{(4)(34)}}={\frac{A}{4}}+{\frac{B+C}{34}}
$$

or

$$
20 = 34A + 4B + 4C \tag{15.11.3}
$$

But  $A = 2$ $C = - 10$  , so that Eq. (15.11.3) gives  $B = - 2$

METHOD 2 Algebraic method: Multiplying both sides of Eq. (15.11.1) by  $(s + 3)(s^{2} + 8s + 25)$  yields

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{20=A(s^{2}+8s+25)+(B s+C)(s+3)}}\\ {{=A(s^{2}+8s+25)+B(s^{2}+3s)+C(s+3)}}\end{array} \tag{15.11.4}
$$

Equating coefficients gives

$$
\begin{array}{r l r l r l}{{s^{2}:}}&{{}}&{0=A+B}&{{}\Rightarrow}&{{}}&{A=-B}\\ {{}}&{{}}&{}&{{}}&{{}}&{{}}\\ {{s:}}&{{}}&{0=8A+3B+C=5A+C}&{{}}&{{}\Rightarrow}&{{}}&{C=-5A}\\ {{}}&{{}}&{}&{{}}&{{}}&{{}}&{{}}\\ {{\mathrm{Constant:}}}&{{}}&{20=25A+3C=25A-15A}&{{}}&{{}\Rightarrow}&{{}}&{A=2}\end{array}
$$

That is,  $B = - 2$ $C = - 10$  . Thus,

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{H(s)=\frac{2}{s+3}-\frac{2s+10}{(s^{2}+8s+25)}=\frac{2}{s+3}-\frac{2(s+4)+2}{(s+4)^{2}+9}}}\\ {{=\frac{2}{s+3}-\frac{2(s+4)}{(s+4)^{2}+9}-\frac{2}{3}\frac{3}{(s+4)^{2}+9}}}\end{array}
$$

Taking the inverse of each term, we obtain

$$
h(t) = \left(2e^{-3t} - 2e^{-4t}\cos 3t - \frac{2}{3} e^{-4t}\sin 3t\right)u(t) \tag{15.11.5}
$$

It is alright to leave the result this way. However, we can combine the cosine and sine terms as

$$
h(t) = (2e^{-3t} - R e^{-4t}\cos (3t - \theta))u(t) \tag{15.11.6}
$$

To obtain Eq. (15.11.6) from Eq. (15.11.5), we apply Eq. (9.11). Next, we determine the coefficient  $R$  and the phase angle  $\theta$ :

$$
R = \sqrt{2^{2} + \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^{2}} = 2.108,\qquad \theta = \tan^{-1}\frac{\frac{2}{3}}{2} = 18.43^{\circ}
$$

Thus,

$$
h(t) = (2e^{-3t} - 2.108e^{-4t}\cos (3t - 18.43^{\circ}))u(t)
$$

Find  $g(t)$  given that

Practice Problem 15.11

$$
G(s) = \frac{60}{(s + 1)(s^{2} + 4s + 13)}
$$

Answer:  $6e^{- t} - 6e^{- 2t}\cos 3t - 2e^{- 2t}\sin 3t, t \geq 0$ .

# 15.5 The Convolution Integral

The term convolution means "folding." Convolution is an invaluable tool to the engineer because it provides a means of viewing and characterizing physical systems. For example, it is used in finding the response  $y(t)$  of a system to an excitation  $x(t)$ , knowing the system impulse response  $h(t)$ . This is achieved through the convolution integral, defined as

$$
y(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}x(\lambda)h(t - \lambda)d\lambda \tag{15.66}
$$

or simply

$$
y(t) = x(t) * h(t) \tag{15.67}
$$

where  $\lambda$  is a dummy variable and the asterisk denotes convolution. Equation (15.66) or (15.67) states that the output is equal to the input convolved with the unit impulse response. The convolution process is commutative:

$$
y(t) = x(t) * h(t) = h(t) * x(t) \tag{15.68a}
$$

or

$$
y(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}x(\lambda)h(t - \lambda)d\lambda = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}h(\lambda)x(t - \lambda)d\lambda \tag{15.68b}
$$

This implies that the order in which the two functions are convolved is immaterial. We will see shortly how to take advantage of this commutative property when performing graphical computation of the convolution integral.

The convolution of two signals consists of time- reversing one of the signals, shifting it, and multiplying it point by point with the second signal, and integrating the product.

The convolution integral in Eq. (15.66) is the general one; it applies to any linear system. However, the convolution integral can be simplified if we assume that a system has two properties. First, if  $x(t) = 0$  for  $t< 0$  , then

$$
y(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}x(\lambda)h(t - \lambda) d\lambda = \int_{0}^{\infty}x(\lambda)h(t - \lambda) d\lambda \tag{15.69}
$$

Second, if the system's impulse response is causal (i.e.,  $h(t) = 0$  for  $t<$  0), then  $h(t - \lambda) = 0$  for  $t - \lambda < 0$  or  $\lambda >t$  , so that Eq. (15.69) becomes

$$
y(t) = h(t)*x(t) = \int_{0}^{t}x(\lambda)h(t - \lambda)d\lambda \tag{15.70}
$$

Here are some properties of the convolution integral.

1.  $x(t)*h(t) = h(t)*x(t)$  (Commutative)

2.  $f(t)*[x(t) + y(t)] = f(t)*x(t) + f(t)*y(t)$  (Distributive)

3.  $f(t)*[x(t)*y(t)] = [f(t)*x(t)]*y(t)$  (Associative)

$$
4. \(f(t)*\delta (t) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f(\lambda)\delta (t - \lambda) d\lambda = f(t)\)
$$

5.  $f(t)*\delta (t - t_{o}) = f(t - t_{o})$

6.  $f(t)*\delta^{\prime}(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f(\lambda)\delta^{\prime}(t - \lambda) d\lambda = f^{\prime}(t)$

7.  $f(t)*u(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f(\lambda)u(t - \lambda) d\lambda = \int_{-\infty}^{t}f(\lambda) d\lambda$

Before learning how to evaluate the convolution integral in Eq. (15.70), let us establish the link between the Laplace transform and the convolution integral. Given two functions  $f_{1}(t)$  and  $f_{2}(t)$  with Laplace transforms  $F_{1}(s)$  and  $F_{2}(s)$  , respectively, their convolution is

$$
f(t) = f_{1}(t)*f_{2}(t) = \int_{0}^{t}f_{1}(\lambda)f_{2}(t - \lambda) d\lambda \tag{15.71}
$$

Taking the Laplace transform gives

$$
F(s) = \mathcal{L}[f_{1}(t)*f_{2}(t)] = F_{1}(s)F_{2}(s) \tag{15.72}
$$

To prove that Eq. (15.72) is true, we begin with the fact that  $F_{1}(s)$  is defined as

$$
F_{1}(s) = \int_{0}^{\infty}f_{1}(\lambda)e^{-s\lambda} d\lambda \tag{15.73}
$$

Multiplying this with  $F_{2}(s)$  gives

$$
F_{1}(s)F_{2}(s) = \int_{0^{-}}^{\infty}f_{1}(\lambda)[F_{2}(s)e^{-s\lambda}] d\lambda \tag{15.74}
$$

We recall from the time shift property in Eq. (15.17) that the term in brackets can be written as

$$
\begin{array}{l}{{F_{2}(s)e^{-s\lambda}=\mathcal{L}[f_{2}(t-\lambda)u(t-\lambda)]}}\\ {{\mathrm{}}}\\ {{\mathrm{}=\int_{0}^{\infty}f_{2}(t-\lambda)u(t-\lambda)e^{-s t}d t}}\end{array} \tag{15.75}
$$

Substituting Eq. (15.75) into Eq. (15.74) gives

$$
F_{1}(s)F_{2}(s) = \int_{0}^{\infty}f_{1}(\lambda)\bigg[\int_{0}^{\infty}f_{2}(t - \lambda)u(t - \lambda)e^{-s t}d t\bigg]d\lambda \tag{15.76}
$$

Interchanging the order of integration results in

$$
F_{1}(s)F_{2}(s) = \int_{0}^{\infty}\biggl [\int_{0}^{t}f_{1}(\lambda)f_{2}(t - \lambda)d\lambda \biggr ]e^{-s t}d t \tag{15.77}
$$

The integral in brackets extends only from 0 to  $t$  because the delayed unit step  $u(t - \lambda) = 1$  for  $\lambda < t$  and  $u(t - \lambda) = 0$  for  $\lambda > t$ . We notice that the integral is the convolution of  $f_{1}(t)$  and  $f_{2}(t)$  as in Eq. (15.71). Hence,

$$
\boxed{F_{1}(s)F_{2}(s) = \mathcal{L}[f_{1}(t)*f_{2}(t)]} \tag{15.78}
$$

as desired. This indicates that convolution in the time domain is equivalent to multiplication in the  $s$ - domain. For example, if  $x(t) = 4e^{- t}$  and  $h(t) = 5e^{- 2t}$ , applying the property in Eq. (15.78), we get

$$
\begin{array}{l}{{h(t)*x(t)=\mathcal{L}^{-1}[H(s)X(s)]=\mathcal{L}^{-1}\bigg[\bigg(\frac{5}{s+2}\bigg)\bigg(\frac{4}{s+1}\bigg)\bigg]}}\\ {{\qquad=\mathcal{L}^{-1}\bigg[\frac{20}{s+1}+\frac{-20}{s+2}\bigg]}}\\ {{\qquad=20(e^{-t}-e^{-2t}),\qquad t\geq0}}\end{array} \tag{15.79}
$$

Although we can find the convolution of two signals using Eq. (15.78), as we have just done, if the product  $F_{1}(s)F_{2}(s)$  is very complicated, finding the inverse may be tough. Also, there are situations in which  $f_{1}(t)$  and  $f_{2}(t)$  are available in the form of experimental data and there are no explicit Laplace transforms. In these cases, one must do the convolution in the time domain.

The process of convolving two signals in the time domain is better appreciated from a graphical point of view. The graphical procedure for evaluating the convolution integral in Eq. (15.70) usually involves four steps.

# Steps to Evaluate the Convolution Integral:

1. Folding: Take the mirror image of  $h(\lambda)$  about the ordinate axis to obtain  $h(-\lambda)$ .

2. Displacement: Shift or delay  $h(-\lambda)$  by  $t$  to obtain  $h(t - \lambda)$ .

3. Multiplication: Find the product of  $h(t - \lambda)$  and  $x(\lambda)$ .

4. Integration: For a given time  $t$ , calculate the area under the product  $h(t - \lambda)x(\lambda)$  for  $0 < \lambda < t$  to get  $y(t)$  at  $t$ .

The folding operation in step 1 is the reason for the term convolution. The function  $h(t - \lambda)$  scans or slides over  $x(\lambda)$ . In view of this superposition procedure, the convolution integral is also known as the superposition integral.

To apply the four steps, it is necessary to be able to sketch  $x(\lambda)$  and  $h(t - \lambda)$ . To get  $x(\lambda)$  from the original function  $x(t)$  involves merely replacing every  $t$  with  $\lambda$ . Sketching  $h(t - \lambda)$  is the key to the convolution process. It involves reflecting  $h(\lambda)$  about the vertical axis and shifting it by  $t$ . Analytically, we obtain  $h(t - \lambda)$  by replacing every  $t$  in  $h(t)$  by  $t - \lambda$ . Given that convolution is commutative, it may be more convenient to apply steps 1 and 2 to  $x(t)$  instead of  $h(t)$ . The best way to illustrate the procedure is with some examples.

Figure 15.10 For Example 15.12.

Find the convolution of the two signals in Fig. 15.10.

# Solution:

We follow the four steps to get  $y(t) = x_{1}(t) * x_{2}(t)$ . First, we fold  $x_{1}(t)$  as shown in Fig. 15.11(a) and shift it by  $t$  as shown in Fig. 15.11(b). For different values of  $t$ , we now multiply the two functions and integrate to determine the area of the overlapping region.

For  $0 < t < 1$ , there is no overlap of the two functions, as shown in Fig. 15.12(a). Hence,

For  $1 < t < 2$ , the two signals overlap between 1 and  $t$ , as shown in Fig. 15.12(b).

$$
y(t) = \int_{1}^{t}(2)(1) d\lambda = 2\lambda \bigg|_{1}^{t} = 2(t - 1), \qquad 1 < t < 2 \tag{15.12.2}
$$

Figure 15.11 (a) Folding  $x_{1}(\lambda)$ , (b) shifting  $x_{1}(-\lambda)$  by  $t$ .

For  $2 < t < 3$ , the two signals completely overlap between  $(t - 1)$  and  $t$ , as shown in Fig. 15.12(c). It is easy to see that the area under the curve is 2. Or

$$
y(t) = \int_{t - 1}^{t}(2)(1) d\lambda = 2\lambda \bigg|_{t - 1}^{t} = 2, \qquad 2 < t < 3 \tag{15.12.3}
$$

For  $3 < t < 4$ , the two signals overlap between  $(t - 1)$  and 3, as shown in Fig. 15.12(d).

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{y(t)=\int_{t-1}^{3}(2)(1)d\lambda=2\lambda\left|_{t-1}^{3}\right.}}\\ {{=2(3-t+1)=8-2t,\qquad3< t< 4}}\end{array} \tag{15.12.4}
$$

For  $t > 4$ , the two signals do not overlap [Fig. 15.12(e)], and

$$
y(t) = 0, \qquad t > 4 \tag{15.12.5}
$$

Combining Eqs. (15.12.1) to (15.12.5), we obtain

$$
y(t) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}0, & 0 \leq t \leq 1 \\ 2t - 2, & 1 \leq t \leq 2 \\ 2, & 2 \leq t \leq 3 \\ 8 - 2t, & 3 \leq t \leq 4 \\ 0, & t \geq 4 \end{array} \right. \tag{15.12.6}
$$

which is sketched in Fig. 15.13. Notice that  $y(t)$  in this equation is continuous. This fact can be used to check the results as we move from one range of  $t$  to another. The result in Eq.

Graphically convolve  $g(t)$  and  $u(t)$  shown in Fig. 15.16.

# Solution:

Let  $y(t) = g(t) * u(t)$ . We can find  $y(t)$  in two ways.

METHOD 1 Suppose we fold  $g(t)$  , as in Fig. 15.17(a), and shift it by  $t$  , as in Fig. 15.17(b). Since  $g(t) = t$ $0< t< 1$  originally, we expect that  $g(t - \lambda) = t - \lambda$ $0< t - \lambda < 1$  or  $t - 1< \lambda < t$  There is no overlap of the two functions when  $t< 0$  so that  $y(0) = 0$  for this case.

(c)

Convolution of  $g(t)$  and  $u(t)$  in Fig. 15.16 with  $g(t)$  folded.

For  $0 < t < 1$ ,  $g(t - \lambda)$  and  $u(\lambda)$  overlap from 0 to  $t$ , as evident in Fig. 15.17(b). Therefore,

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{y(t)=\int_{0}^{t}(1)(t-\lambda)d\lambda=\left(t\lambda-\frac{1}{2}\lambda^{2}\right)\left[\begin{array}{l}{{t}}\\ {{0}}\end{array}\right.}}\\ {{=t^{2}-\frac{t^{2}}{2}=\frac{t^{2}}{2},\qquad0\leq t\leq1}}\end{array} \tag{15.13.1}
$$

(15.13.1)

For  $t > 1$ , the two functions overlap completely between  $(t - 1)$  and  $t$  [see Fig. 15.17(c)]. Hence,

$$
\begin{array}{l}{{y(t)=\int_{t-1}^{t}(1)(t-\lambda)d\lambda}}\\ {{\mathrm{}}}\\ {{=(t\lambda-\frac{1}{2}\lambda^{2})|_{t-1}^{t}=\frac{1}{2},\qquad t\geq1}}\end{array} \tag{15.13.2}
$$

Thus, from Eqs. (15.13.1) and (15.13.2),

$$
y(t) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}\frac{1}{2} t^2, & 0 \leq t \leq 1 \\ \frac{1}{2}, & t \geq 1 \end{array} \right.
$$

METHOD 2 Instead of folding  $g$ , suppose we fold the unit step function  $u(t)$ , as in Fig. 15.18(a), and then shift it by  $t$ , as in Fig. 15.18(b). Because  $u(t) = 1$  for  $t > 0$ ,  $u(t - \lambda) = 1$  for  $t - \lambda > 0$  or  $\lambda < t$ , the two functions overlap from 0 to  $t$ , so that

$$
y(t) = \int_{0}^{t}(1) \lambda d\lambda = \frac{1}{2} \lambda^2 \Big|_{0}^{t} = \frac{t^2}{2}, \qquad 0 \leq t \leq 1 \tag{15.13.3}
$$

(c)

For  $t > 1$ , the two functions overlap between 0 and 1, as shown in Fig. 15.18(c). Hence,

$$
y(t) = \int_{0}^{1}(1)\lambda d\lambda = \frac{1}{2}\lambda^{2}|_{0}^{1} = \frac{1}{2},\qquad t\geq 1 \tag{15.13.4}
$$

And, from Eqs. (15.13.3) and (15.13.4),

$$
y(t) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}\frac{1}{2} t^{2}, & 0\leq t\leq 1 \\ \frac{1}{2}, & t\geq 1 \end{array} \right.
$$

Although the two methods give the same result, as expected, notice that it is more convenient to fold the unit step function  $u(t)$  than fold  $g(t)$  in this example. Figure 15.19 shows  $y(t)$ .

For the  $RL$  circuit in Fig. 15.21(a), use the convolution integral to find the response  $i_{o}(t)$  due to the excitation shown in Fig. 15.21(b).

# Solution:

1. Define. The problem is clearly stated and the method of solution is also specified.

Figure 15.22 For the circuit in Fig. 15.21(a): (a) its  $s$ -domain equivalent, (b) its impulse response.

2. Present. We are to use the convolution integral to solve for the response  $i_{o}(t)$  due to  $i_{s}(t)$  shown in Fig. 15.21(b).

3. Alternative. We have learned to do convolution by using the convolution integral and how to do it graphically. In addition, we could always work in the  $s$ -domain to solve for the current. We will solve for the current using the convolution integral and then check it using the graphical approach.

4. Attempt. As we stated, this problem can be solved in two ways: directly using the convolution integral or using the graphical technique. To use either approach, we first need the unit impulse response  $h(t)$  of the circuit. In the  $s$ -domain, applying the current division principle to the circuit in Fig. 15.22(a) gives

$$
I_{o} = \frac{1}{s + 1} I_{s}
$$

Hence,

$$
H(s) = \frac{I_{o}}{I_{s}} = \frac{1}{s + 1} \tag{15.14.1}
$$

and the inverse Laplace transform of this gives

$$
h(t) = e^{-t}u(t) \tag{15.14.2}
$$

Figure 15.22(b) shows the impulse response  $h(t)$  of the circuit.

To use the convolution integral directly, recall that the response is given in the  $s$ - domain as

$$
I_{o}(s) = H(s)I_{s}(s)
$$

With the given  $i_{s}(t)$  in Fig. 15.21(b),

$$
i_{s}(t) = u(t) - u(t - 2)
$$

so that

$$
\begin{array}{l}{{i_{o}(t)=h(t)\ast i_{s}(t)=\int_{0}^{t}i_{s}(\lambda)h(t-\lambda)d\lambda}}\\ {{=\int_{0}^{t}[u(\lambda)-u(\lambda-2)]e^{-(t-\lambda)}d\lambda}}\end{array} \tag{15.14.3}
$$

(15.14.3)

Since  $u(\lambda - 2) = 0$  for  $0< \lambda < 2$ , the integrand involving  $u(\lambda)$  is nonzero for all  $\lambda >0$ , whereas the integrand involving  $u(\lambda - 2)$  is nonzero only for  $\lambda >2$ . The best way to handle the integral is to do the two parts separately. For  $0< t< 2$

$$
\begin{array}{l}{{i_{o}^{\prime}(t)=\int_{0}^{t}(1)e^{-(t-\lambda)}d\lambda=e^{-t}\int_{0}^{t}(1)e^{\lambda}d\lambda}}\\ {{=e^{-t}(e^{t}-1)=1-e^{-t},\qquad0< t< 2}}\end{array} \tag{15.14.4}
$$

For  $t > 2$

$$
\begin{array}{l}{{i_{o}^{\prime\prime}(t)=\int_{2}^{t}(1)e^{-(t-\lambda)}d\lambda=e^{-t}\int_{2}^{t}e^{\lambda}d\lambda}}\\ {{=e^{-t}(e^{t}-e^{2})=1-e^{2}e^{-t},\qquad t>2}}\end{array} \tag{15.14.5}
$$

Substituting Eqs. (15.14.4) and (15.14.5) into Eq. (15.14.3) gives

$$
\begin{array}{r l} & {i_{o}(t) = i_{o}^{\prime}(t) - i_{o}^{\prime \prime}(t)}\\ & {\qquad = (1 - e^{-t})[u(t - 2) - u(t)] - (1 - e^{2}e^{-t})u(t - 2)}\\ & {\qquad = \left\{ \begin{array}{l l}{1 - e^{-t}\mathbf{A},} & {0< t< 2}\\ {(e^{2} - 1)e^{-t}\mathbf{A},} & {t > 2} \end{array} \right.} \end{array} \tag{15.14.6}
$$

5. Evaluate. To use the graphical technique, we may fold  $i_{s}(t)$  in Fig. 15.21(b) and shift by  $t$ , as shown in Fig. 15.23(a). For  $0 < t < 2$ , the overlap between  $i_{s}(t - \lambda)$  and  $h(\lambda)$  is from 0 to  $t$ , so that

$$
i_{o}(t) = \int_{0}^{t} (1) e^{-\lambda} d\lambda = -e^{-\lambda} \bigg|_{0}^{t} = (1 - e^{-t}) \mathbf{A}, \qquad 0 \leq t \leq 2 \tag{15.14.7}
$$

For  $t > 2$ , the two functions overlap between  $(t - 2)$  and  $t$ , as in Fig. 15.23(b). Hence,

# 15.6 Application to Integrodifferential Equations

The Laplace transform is useful in solving linear integrodifferential equations. Using the differentiation and integration properties of Laplace transforms, each term in the integrodifferential equation is transformed.

Initial conditions are automatically taken into account. We solve the resulting algebraic equation in the  $s$ - domain. We then convert the solution back to the time domain by using the inverse transform. The following examples illustrate the process.

# Example 15.15

Use the Laplace transform to solve the differential equation

$$
\frac{d^{2}V(t)}{dt^{2}} + 6 \frac{dV(t)}{dt} + 8V(t) = 2u(t)
$$

subject to  $\nu (0) = 1$ ,  $\nu '(0) = - 2$ .

# Solution:

We take the Laplace transform of each term in the given differential equation and obtain

$$
[s^{2}V(s) - s\nu (0) - \nu '(0)] + 6[sV(s) - \nu (0)] + 8V(s) = \frac{2}{s}
$$

Substituting  $\nu (0) = 1$ ,  $\nu '(0) = - 2$ ,

$$
s^{2}V(s) - s + 2 + 6sV(s) - 6 + 8V(s) = \frac{2}{s}
$$

or

$$
(s^{2} + 6s + 8)V(s) = s + 4 + \frac{2}{s} = \frac{s^{2} + 4s + 2}{s}
$$

Hence,

$$
V(s) = \frac{s^{2} + 4s + 2}{s(s + 2)(s + 4)} = \frac{A}{s} + \frac{B}{s + 2} + \frac{C}{s + 4}
$$

where

$$
A = sV(s) \big|_{s = 0} = \frac{s^{2} + 4s + 2}{(s + 2)(s + 4)} \big|_{s = 0} = \frac{2}{(2)(4)} = \frac{1}{4}
$$

$$
B = (s + 2)V(s) \big|_{s = -2} = \frac{s^{2} + 4s + 2}{s(s + 4)} \big|_{s = -2} = \frac{-2}{(-2)(2)} = \frac{1}{2}
$$

$$
C = (s + 4)V(s) \big|_{s = -4} = \frac{s^{2} + 4s + 2}{s(s + 2)} \big|_{s = -4} = \frac{2}{(-4)(-2)} = \frac{1}{4}
$$

Hence,

$$
V(s) = \frac{\frac{1}{4}}{s} + \frac{\frac{1}{2}}{s + 2} + \frac{\frac{1}{4}}{s + 4}
$$

By the inverse Laplace transform,

$$
\nu (t) = \frac{1}{4} (1 + 2e^{-2t} + e^{-4t}) u(t)
$$

Solve the following differential equation using the Laplace transform method.

$$
\frac{d^{2}\nu(t)}{d t^{2}} +4\frac{d\nu(t)}{d t} +4\nu (t) = 2e^{-t}
$$

if  $\nu (0) = \nu^{\prime}(0) = 2$

Answer:  $(2e^{- t} + 4t e^{- 2t})u(t)$

Solve for the response  $y(t)$  in the following integrodifferential equation.

$$
\frac{d y}{d t} +5y(t) + 6\int_{0}^{t}y(\tau)d\tau = u(t),\qquad y(0) = 2
$$

# Solution:

Taking the Laplace transform of each term, we get

$$
[s Y(s) - y(0)] + 5Y(s) + \frac{6}{s} Y(s) = \frac{1}{s}
$$

Substituting  $y(0) = 2$  and multiplying through by  $s$

$$
Y(s)(s^{2} + 5s + 6) = 1 + 2s
$$

or

$$
Y(s) = \frac{2s + 1}{(s + 2)(s + 3)} = \frac{A}{s + 2} +\frac{B}{s + 3}
$$

where

$$
A = (s + 2)Y(s)\left|_{s = -2} = \frac{2s + 1}{s + 3}\right|_{s = -2} = \frac{-3}{1} = -3
$$

$$
B = (s + 3)Y(s)\left|_{s = -3} = \frac{2s + 1}{s + 2}\right|_{s = -3} = \frac{-5}{-1} = 5
$$

Thus,

$$
Y(s) = \frac{-3}{s + 2} +\frac{5}{s + 3}
$$

Its inverse transform is

$$
y(t) = (-3e^{-2t} + 5e^{-3t})u(t)
$$

Use the Laplace transform to solve the integrodifferential equation

Practice Problem 15.16

$$
\frac{d y}{d t} +3y(t) + 2\int_{0}^{t}y(\tau)d\tau = 2e^{-3t},\qquad y(0) = 0
$$

Answer:  $(- e^{- t} + 4e^{- 2t} - 3e^{- 3t})u(t)$

# 15.7 Summary

1. The Laplace transform allows a signal represented by a function in the time domain to be analyzed in the  $s$ -domain (or complex frequency domain). It is defined as

$$
\mathcal{L}[f(t)] = F(s) = \int_{0}^{\infty}f(t)e^{-s t}d t
$$

2. Properties of the Laplace transform are listed in Table 15.1, while the Laplace transforms of basic common functions are listed in Table 15.2.

3. The inverse Laplace transform can be found using partial fraction expansions and using the Laplace transform pairs in Table 15.2 as a look-up table. Real poles lead to exponential functions and complex poles to damped sinusoids.

4. The convolution of two signals consists of time-reversing one of the signals, shifting it, multiplying it point by point with the second signal, and integrating the product. The convolution integral relates the convolution of two signals in the time domain to the inverse of the product of their Laplace transforms:

$$
\mathcal{L}^{-1}[F_{t}(s)F_{2}(s)] = f_{1}(t)*f_{2}(t) = \int_{0}^{t}f_{1}(\lambda)f_{2}(t - 2)d\lambda
$$

5. In the time domain, the output  $y(t)$  of the network is the convolution of the impulse response with the input  $x(t)$

$$
y(t) = h(t)*x(t)
$$

Convolution may be regarded as the flip- shift- multiply- time- area method.

6. The Laplace transform can be used to solve a linear integrodifferential equation.

# Applications of the Laplace Transform

Applications of the Laplace TransformCommunication skills are the most important skills any engineer can have. A very critical element in this tool set is the ability to ask a question and understand the answer, a very simple thing and yet it may make the difference between success and failure!—James A.

# Enhancing Your Skills and Your Career

# Asking Questions

In more than 30 years of teaching, I have struggled with determining how best to help students learn. Regardless of how much time students spend in studying for a course, the most helpful activity for students is learning how to ask questions in class and then asking those questions. The student, by asking questions, becomes actively involved in the learning process and no longer is merely a passive receptor of information. I think this active involvement contributes so much to the learning process that it is probably the single most important aspect to the development of a modern engineer. In fact, asking questions is the basis of science. As Charles P. Steinmetz rightly said, "No man really becomes a fool until he stops asking questions."

It seems very straightforward and quite easy to ask questions. Have we not been doing that all our lives? The truth is to ask questions in an appropriate manner and to maximize the learning process takes some thought and preparation.

I am sure that there are several models one could effectively use. Let me share what has worked for me. The most important thing to keep in mind is that you do not have to form a perfect question. Because the question- and- answer format allows the question to be developed in an iterative manner, the original question can easily be refined as you go. I frequently tell students that they are most welcome to read their questions in class.

Here are three things you should keep in mind when asking questions. First, prepare your question. If you are like many students who are either shy or have not learned to ask questions in class, you may wish to start with a question you have written down outside of class. Second, wait for an appropriate time to ask the question. Simply use your judgment on that. Third, be prepared to clarify your question by paraphrasing it or saying it in a different way in case you are asked to repeat the question.

# Learning Objectives

By using the information and exercises in this chapter you will be able to:

1. Understand and use effectively circuit element models in the  $s$ -domain.  
2. Understand how to perform circuit analysis in the  $s$ -domain and how to transform the results back into the time domain.

# 16.1 Introduction

Now that we have introduced the Laplace transform, let us see what we can do with it. Keep in mind that with the Laplace transform we actually have one of the most powerful mathematical tools for analysis, synthesis, and design. Being able to look at circuits and systems in the  $s$ - domain can help us to understand how our circuits and systems really function. In this chapter we will take an in- depth look at how easy it is to work with circuits in the  $s$ - domain. In addition, we will briefly look at physical systems. We are sure you have studied some mechanical systems and may have used the same differential equations to describe them as we use to describe our electric circuits. Actually that is a wonderful thing about the physical universe in which we live; the same differential equations can be used to describe any linear circuit, system, or process. The key is the term linear.

A system is a mathematical model of a physical process relating the input to the output.

It is entirely appropriate to consider circuits as systems. Historically, circuits have been discussed as a separate topic from systems, so we will actually talk about circuits and systems in this chapter realizing that circuits are nothing more than a class of electrical systems.

The most important thing to remember is that everything we discussed in the last chapter and in this chapter applies to any linear system. In the last chapter, we saw how we can use Laplace transforms to solve linear differential equations and integral equations. In this chapter, we introduce the concept of modeling circuits in the  $s$ - domain. We can use that principle to help us solve just about any kind of linear circuit. We will take a quick look at how state variables can be used to analyze systems with multiple inputs and multiple outputs. Finally, we examine how the Laplace transform is used in network stability analysis and in network synthesis.

# 16.2 Circuit Element Models

Having mastered how to obtain the Laplace transform and its inverse, we are now prepared to employ the Laplace transform to analyze circuits. This usually involves three steps.

# Steps in Applying the Laplace Transform:

1. Transform the circuit from the time domain to the  $s$ -domain.

2. Solve the circuit using nodal analysis, mesh analysis, source transformation, superposition, or any circuit analysis technique with which we are familiar.

3. Take the inverse transform of the solution and thus obtain the solution in the time domain.

Only the first step is new and will be discussed here. As we did in phasor analysis, we transform a circuit in the time domain to the frequency or  $s$ - domain by Laplace transforming each term in the circuit.

For a resistor, the voltage- current relationship in the time domain is

$$
\nu (t) = R i(t) \tag{16.1}
$$

Taking the Laplace transform, we get

$$
V(s) = R I(s) \tag{16.2}
$$

For an inductor,

$$
\nu (t) = L \frac{di(t)}{dt} \tag{16.3}
$$

Taking the Laplace transform of both sides gives

$$
V(s) = L[sI(s) - i(0^{-})] = sLI(s) - Li(0^{-}) \tag{16.4}
$$

or

$$
I(s) = \frac{1}{sL} V(s) + \frac{i(0^{-})}{s} \tag{16.5}
$$

The  $s$ - domain equivalents are shown in Fig. 16.1, where the initial condition is modeled as a voltage or current source.

For a capacitor,

$$
i(t) = C \frac{d\nu(t)}{dt} \tag{16.6}
$$

which transforms into the  $s$ - domain as

$$
I(s) = C[sV(s) - \nu (0^{-})] = sCV(s) - C\nu (0^{-}) \tag{16.7}
$$

or

$$
V(s) = \frac{1}{sC} I(s) + \frac{\nu(0^{-})}{s} \tag{16.8}
$$

As one can infer from step 2, all the circuit analysis techniques applied for dc circuits are applicable to the  $s$ - domain.

The elegance of using the Laplace transform in circuit analysis lies in the automatic inclusion of the initial conditions in the transformation process, thus providing a complete (transient and steady- state) solution.

Figure 16.2 Representation of a capacitor: (a) time-domain, (b,c)  $s$ -domain equivalents.

The  $s$ - domain equivalents are shown in Fig. 16.2. With the  $s$ - domain equivalents, the Laplace transform can be used readily to solve first- and second- order circuits such as those we considered in Chapters 7 and 8. We should observe from Eqs. (16.3) to (16.8) that the initial conditions are part of the transformation. This is one advantage of using the Laplace transform in circuit analysis. Another advantage is that a complete response—transient and steady state—of a network is obtained. We will illustrate this with Examples 16.2 and 16.3. Also, observe the duality of Eqs. (16.5) and (16.8), confirming what we already know from Chapter 8 (see Table 8.1), namely, that  $L$  and  $C$ ,  $I(s)$  and  $V(s)$ , and  $\nu (0)$  and  $i(0)$  are dual pairs.

If we assume zero initial conditions for the inductor and the capacitor, the above equations reduce to:

$$
\begin{array}{l l}{{\mathrm{Resistor:}}}&{{V(s)=R I(s)}}\\ {{\mathrm{Inductor:}}}&{{V(s)=s L I(s)}}\\ {{\mathrm{Capacitor:}}}&{{V(s)=\frac{1}{s C}I(s)}}\end{array} \tag{16.9}
$$

The  $s$ - domain equivalents are shown in Fig. 16.3.

We define the impedance in the  $s$ - domain as the ratio of the voltage transform to the current transform under zero initial conditions; that is,

$$
Z(s) = \frac{V(s)}{I(s)} \tag{16.10}
$$

Thus, the impedances of the three circuit elements are

$$
\begin{array}{l l}{{\mathrm{Resistor:}}}}&{{Z(s)=R}}\\ {{\mathrm{Inductor:}}}}&{{Z(s)=s L}}\\ {{\mathrm{Capacitor:}}}}&{{Z(s)=\frac{1}{s C}}}\end{array} \tag{16.11}
$$

# TABLE 16.1

<table><tr><td>Element</td><td>Z(s) = V(s)/I(s)</td></tr><tr><td>Resistor</td><td>R</td></tr><tr><td>Inductor</td><td>sL</td></tr><tr><td>Capacitor</td><td>1/sC</td></tr></table>

Table 16.1 summarizes these. The admittance in the  $s$ - domain is the reciprocal of the impedance, or

$$
Y(s) = \frac{1}{Z(s)} = \frac{I(s)}{V(s)} \tag{16.12}
$$

The use of the Laplace transform in circuit analysis facilitates the use of various signal sources such as impulse, step, ramp, exponential, and sinusoidal.

The models for dependent sources and op amps are easy to develop drawing from the simple fact that if the Laplace transform of  $f(t)$  is  $F(s)$ ,

then the Laplace transform of  $a f(t)$  is  $a F(s)$  the linearity property. The dependent source model is a little easier in that we deal with a single value. The dependent source can have only two controlling values, a constant times either a voltage or a current. Thus,

$$
\begin{array}{l}\mathcal{L}[a\nu (t)] = a V(s) \\ \mathcal{L}[a i(t)] = a I(s) \end{array} \tag{16.13}
$$

The ideal op amp can be treated just like a resistor. Nothing within an op amp, either real or ideal, does anything more than multiply a voltage by a constant. Thus, we only need to write the equations as we always do using the constraint that the input voltage to the op amp has to be zero and the input current has to be zero.

Find  $\nu_{o}(t)$  in the circuit of Fig. 16.4, assuming zero initial conditions.

# Solution:

We first transform the circuit from the time domain to the  $s$ - domain.

$$
\begin{array}{l l l}{{u(t)}}&{{\Rightarrow}}&{{\frac{1}{s}}}\\ {{}}&{{}}&{{}}\\ {{1\mathrm{~H~}}}&{{\Rightarrow}}&{{s L=s}}\\ {{}}&{{}}&{{}}\\ {{\frac{1}{3}\mathrm{F~}}}&{{\Rightarrow}}&{{\frac{1}{s C}=\frac{3}{s}}}\end{array}
$$

The resulting  $s$ - domain circuit is in Fig. 16.5. We now apply mesh analysis. For mesh 1,

$$
\frac{1}{s} = \left(1 + \frac{3}{s}\right) I_{1} - \frac{3}{s} I_{2} \tag{16.1.1}
$$

For mesh 2,

$$
0 = -\frac{3}{s} I_{1} + \left(s + 5 + \frac{3}{s}\right) I_{2}
$$

or

$$
I_{1} = \frac{1}{3} (s^{2} + 5s + 3) I_{2} \tag{16.1.2}
$$

Substituting this into Eq. (16.1.1),

$$
\frac{1}{s} = \left(1 + \frac{3}{s}\right) \frac{1}{3} (s^{2} + 5s + 3) I_{2} - \frac{3}{s} I_{2}
$$

Multiplying through by  $3s$  gives

$$
\begin{array}{c c c}{{3=(s^{3}+8s^{2}+18s)I_{2}}}&{{\Rightarrow}}&{{I_{2}=\frac{3}{s^{3}+8s^{2}+18s}}}\\ {{}}&{{}}&{{}}\\ {{V_{o}(s)=s I_{2}=\frac{3}{s^{2}+8s+18}=\frac{3}{\sqrt{2}}\frac{\sqrt{2}}{(s+4)^{2}+(\sqrt{2})^{2}}}}\end{array}
$$

Taking the inverse transform yields

$$
\nu_{o}(t) = \frac{3}{\sqrt{2}} e^{-4t} \sin \sqrt{2t} \mathrm{~V}, \qquad t \geq 0
$$

Find  $\nu_{o}(t)$  in the circuit of Fig. 16.7. Assume  $\nu_{o}(0) = 5$  V.

# Solution:

We transform the circuit to the  $s$ - domain as shown in Fig. 16.8. The initial condition is included in the form of the current source  $C\nu_{o}(0) = 0.1(5) = 0.5$  A. [See Fig. 16.2(c).] We apply nodal analysis. At the top node,

$$
\frac{10 / (s + 1) - V_{o}}{10} +2 + 0.5 = \frac{V_{o}}{10} +\frac{V_{o}}{10 / s}
$$

or

$$
\frac{1}{s + 1} +2.5 = \frac{2V_{o}}{10} +\frac{sV_{o}}{10} = \frac{1}{10} V_{o}(s + 2)
$$

\frac{10}{s + 1} +25 = V_{o}(s + 2)
$$

or

$$
V_{o} = \frac{25s + 35}{(s + 1)(s + 2)} = \frac{A}{s + 1} +\frac{B}{s + 2}
$$

where

$$
A = (s + 1)V_{o}(s)\big|_{s = -1} = \frac{25s + 35}{(s + 2)}\bigg|_{s = -1} = \frac{10}{1} = 10
$$

$$
B = (s + 2)V_{o}(s)\big|_{s = -2} = \frac{25s + 35}{(s + 1)}\bigg|_{s = -2} = \frac{-15}{-1} = 15
$$

Thus,

$$
V_{o}(s) = \frac{10}{s + 1} +\frac{15}{s + 2}
$$

Taking the inverse Laplace transform, we obtain

$$
\nu_{o}(t) = (10e^{-t} + 15e^{-2t})u(t)\mathrm{~V~}
$$

Find  $\nu_{o}(t)$  in the circuit shown in Fig. 16.9. Note that, since the voltage input is multiplied by  $u(t)$ , the voltage source is a short for all  $t < 0$  and  $i_{L}(0) = 0$ .

Answer:  $(60e^{- 2t} - 10e^{- t / 3})u(t)$  V.

# Practice Problem 16.2

Figure 16.9 For Practice Prob. 16.2.

In the circuit of Fig. 16.10(a), the switch moves from position  $a$  to position  $b$  at  $t = 0$ . Find  $i(t)$  for  $t > 0$ .

# Solution:

The initial current through the inductor is  $i(0) = I_{o}$ . For  $t > 0$ , Fig. 16.10(b) shows the circuit transformed to the  $s$ - domain. The initial condition is incorporated in the form of a voltage source as  $L i(0) = L I_{o}$ . Using mesh analysis,

$$
I(s)(R + sL) - L I_{o} - \frac{V_{o}}{s} = 0 \tag{16.3.1}
$$

or

$$
I(s) = \frac{L I_{o}}{R + s L} +\frac{V_{o}}{s(R + s L)} = \frac{I_{o}}{s + R / L} +\frac{V_{o} / L}{s(s + R / L)} \tag{16.3.2}
$$

Applying partial fraction expansion on the second term on the right- hand side of Eq. (16.3.2) yields

$$
I(s) = \frac{I_{o}}{s + R / L} +\frac{V_{o} / R}{s} -\frac{V_{o} / R}{(s + R / L)} \tag{16.3.3}
$$

The inverse Laplace transform of this gives

$$
i(t) = \left(I_{o} - \frac{V_{o}}{R}\right)e^{-t / \tau} + \frac{V_{o}}{R}, \qquad t \geq 0 \tag{16.3.4}
$$

where  $\tau = R / L$ . The term in parentheses is the transient response, while the second term is the steady- state response. In other words, the final value is  $i(\infty) = V_{o} / R$ , which we could have predicted by applying the final- value theorem on Eq. (16.3.2) or (16.3.3); that is,

$$
\lim_{s\to 0}s I(s) = \lim_{s\to 0}\left(\frac{s I_{o}}{s + R / L} +\frac{V_{o} / L}{s + R / L}\right) = \frac{V_{o}}{R} \tag{16.3.5}
$$

Equation (16.3.4) may also be written as

$$
i(t) = I_{o}e^{-t / \tau} + \frac{V_{o}}{R} (1 - e^{-t / \tau}), \qquad t \geq 0 \tag{16.3.6}
$$

The first term is the natural response, while the second term is the forced response. If the initial condition  $I_{o} = 0$ , Eq. (16.3.6) becomes

$$
i(t) = \frac{V_{o}}{R} (1 - e^{-t / \tau}), \qquad t \geq 0 \tag{16.3.7}
$$

which is the step response, since it is due to the step input  $V_{o}$  with no initial energy.

Answer:  $\nu (t) = (V_{o} - I_{o}R)e^{- t / \tau} + I_{o}R, t > 0$ , where  $\tau = RC$ .

# 16.3 Circuit Analysis

Circuit analysis is again relatively easy to do when we are in the  $s$ - domain. We merely need to transform a complicated set of mathematical relationships in the time domain into the  $s$ - domain where we convert operators (derivatives and integrals) into simple multipliers of  $s$  and  $1 / s$ . This now allows us to use algebra to set up and solve our circuit equations. The exciting thing about this is that all of the circuit theorems and relationships we developed for dc circuits are perfectly valid in the  $s$ - domain.

Remember, equivalent circuits, with capacitors and inductors, only exist in the  $s$ - domain; they cannot be transformed back into the time domain.

# Example 16.4

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-14/63c420e9-9220-47ad-935a-09e6b2aeb2a8/a78d6a26a6d0bfcc19199c728763b95dcdca7dc9608021ee12968a9c6d0dcf4c.jpg)  
Figure 16.12 For Example 16.4.

Consider the circuit in Fig. 16.12(a). Find the value of the voltage across the capacitor assuming that the value of  $\nu_{s}(t) = 10u(t)\mathrm{V}$  and assume that at  $t = 0$ ,  $- 1$  A flows through the inductor and  $+5\mathrm{V}$  is across the capacitor.

# Solution:

Figure 16.12(b) represents the entire circuit in the  $s$ - domain with the initial conditions incorporated. We now have a straightforward nodal analysis problem. Because the value of  $V_{1}$  is also the value of the capacitor voltage in the time domain and is the only unknown node voltage, we only need to write one equation.

$$
\frac{V_{1} - 10 / s}{10 / 3} +\frac{V_{1} - 0}{5s} +\frac{i(0)}{s} +\frac{V_{1} - [\nu(0) / s]}{1 / (0.1s)} = 0 \tag{16.4.1}
$$

or

$$
0.1\left(s + 3 + \frac{2}{s}\right)V_{1} = \frac{3}{s} +\frac{1}{s} +0.5 \tag{16.4.2}
$$

where  $\nu (0) = 5\mathrm{V}$  and  $i(0) = - 1$  A. Simplifying we get

$$
(s^{2} + 3s + 2)V_{1} = 40 + 5s
$$

or

$$
V_{1} = \frac{40 + 5s}{(s + 1)(s + 2)} = \frac{35}{s + 1} -\frac{30}{s + 2} \tag{16.4.3}
$$

Taking the inverse Laplace transform yields

$$
\nu_{1}(t) = (35e^{-t} - 30e^{-2t})u(t)\mathrm{V} \tag{16.4.4}
$$

For the circuit shown in Fig. 16.12 with the same initial conditions, find the current through the inductor for all time  $t > 0$ .

Answer:  $i(t) = (3 - 7e^{- t} + 3e^{- 2t})u(t)$  A.

For the circuit shown in Fig. 16.12, and the initial conditions used in Example 16.4, use superposition to find the value of the capacitor voltage.

# Solution:

Inasmuch as the circuit in the  $s$ - domain actually has three independent sources, we can look at the solution one source at a time. Figure 16.13 presents the circuits in the  $s$ - domain considering one source at a time. We now have three nodal analysis problems. First, let us solve for the capacitor voltage in the circuit shown in Fig. 16.13(a).

$$
\frac{V_{1} - 10 / s}{10 / 3} +\frac{V_{1} - 0}{5s} +0 + \frac{V_{1} - 0}{1 / (0.1s)} = 0
$$

or

$$
0.1\Big(s + 3 + \frac{2}{s}\Big)V_{1} = \frac{3}{s}
$$

Simplifying we get

$$
(s^{2} + 3s + 2)V_{1} = 30
$$

$$
V_{1} = \frac{30}{(s + 1)(s + 2)} = \frac{30}{s + 1} -\frac{30}{s + 2}
$$

or

$$
\nu_{1}(t) = (30e^{-t} - 30e^{-2t})u(t)\mathrm{~V~} \tag{16.5.1}
$$

For Fig. 16.13(b) we get,

$$
\frac{V_{2} - 0}{10 / 3} +\frac{V_{2} - 0}{5s} -\frac{1}{s} +\frac{V_{2} - 0}{1 / (0.1s)} = 0
$$

or

$$
0.1\Big(s + 3 + \frac{2}{s}\Big)V_{2} = \frac{1}{s}
$$

This leads to

$$
V_{2} = \frac{10}{(s + 1)(s + 2)} = \frac{10}{s + 1} -\frac{10}{s + 2}
$$

Taking the inverse Laplace transform, we get

$$
\nu_{2}(t) = (10e^{-t} - 10e^{-2t})u(t)\mathrm{~V~} \tag{16.5.2}
$$

For Fig. 16.13(c),

$$
\frac{V_{3} - 0}{10 / 3} +\frac{V_{3} - 0}{5s} -0 + \frac{V_{3} - 5 / s}{1 / (0.1s)} = 0
$$

Figure 16.13 For Example 16.5.

or

$$
0.1\Big(s + 3 + \frac{2}{s}\Big)V_{3} = 0.5
$$

$$
V_{3} = \frac{5s}{(s + 1)(s + 2)} = \frac{-5}{s + 1} +\frac{10}{s + 2}
$$

This leads to

$$
\nu_{3}(t) = (-5e^{-t} + 10e^{-2t})u(t)\mathrm{~V~} \tag{16.5.3}
$$

Now all we need to do is to add Eqs. (16.5.1), (16.5.2), and (16.5.3):

$$
\begin{array}{r l} & {\nu (t) = \nu_{1}(t) + \nu_{2}(t) + \nu_{3}(t)}\\ & {\qquad = \{(30 + 10 - 5)e^{-t} + (-30 + 10 - 10)e^{-2t}\} u(t)\mathrm{~V~}} \end{array}
$$

or

$$
\nu (t) = (35e^{-t} - 30e^{-2t})u(t)\mathrm{~V~}
$$

which agrees with our answer in Example 16.4.

Figure 16.14 For Example 16.6.

Assume that there is no initial energy stored in the circuit of Fig. 16.14 at  $t = 0$  and that  $i_{s} = 10u(t)$  A. (a) Find  $V_{o}(s)$  using Thevenin's theorem. (b) Apply the initial- and final- value theorems to find  $\nu_{o}(0^{+})$  and  $\nu_{o}(\infty)$ . (c) Determine  $\nu_{o}(t)$ .

# Solution:

Because there is no initial energy stored in the circuit, we assume that the initial inductor current and initial capacitor voltage are zero at  $t = 0$

(a) To find the Thevenin equivalent circuit, we remove the  $5 - \Omega$  resistor and then find  $V_{\mathrm{oc}}$ $(V_{\mathrm{Th}})$  and  $I_{\mathrm{sc}}$ . To find  $V_{\mathrm{Th}}$ , we use the Laplace-transformed circuit in Fig. 16.15(a). Since  $I_{x} = 0$ , the dependent voltage source contributes nothing, so

$$
V_{\mathrm{oc}} = V_{\mathrm{Th}} = 5\Big(\frac{10}{s}\Big) = \frac{50}{s}
$$

To find  $Z_{\mathrm{Th}}$ , we consider the circuit in Fig. 16.15(b), where we first find  $I_{\mathrm{sc}}$ . We can use nodal analysis to solve for  $V_{1}$  which then leads to  $I_{\mathrm{sc}}(I_{\mathrm{sc}} = I_{x} = V_{1} / 2s)$ .

$$
-\frac{10}{s} +\frac{(V_{1} - 2I_{x}) - 0}{5} +\frac{V_{1} - 0}{2s} = 0
$$

along with

$$
I_{x} = \frac{V_{1}}{2s}
$$

leads to

$$
V_{1} = \frac{100}{2s + 3}
$$

Hence,

$$
I_{\mathrm{sc}} = \frac{V_{1}}{2s} = \frac{100 / (2s + 3)}{2s} = \frac{50}{s(2s + 3)}
$$

and

$$
Z_{\mathrm{Th}} = \frac{V_{\mathrm{o}}}{I_{\mathrm{sc}}} = \frac{50 / s}{50 / [s(2s + 3)]} = 2s + 3
$$

The given circuit is replaced by its Thevenin equivalent at terminals  $a - b$  as shown in Fig. 16.16. From Fig. 16.16,

$$
V_{o} = \frac{5}{5 + Z_{\mathrm{Th}}} V_{\mathrm{Th}} = \frac{5}{5 + 2s + 3}\left(\frac{50}{s}\right) = \frac{250}{s(2s + 8)} = \frac{125}{s(s + 4)}
$$

(b) Using the initial-value theorem we find

$$
\nu_{o}(0) = \lim_{s\to \infty}s V_{o}(s) = \lim_{s\to \infty}\frac{125}{s + 4} = \lim_{s\to \infty}\frac{125 / s}{1 + 4 / s} = \frac{0}{1} = 0
$$

Using the final- value theorem we find

$$
\nu_{o}(\infty) = \lim_{s\to 0}s V_{o}(s) = \lim_{s\to 0}\frac{125}{s + 4} = \frac{125}{4} = 31.25\mathrm{~V~}
$$

(c) By partial fraction,

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{V_{o}=\frac{125}{s(s+4)}=\frac{A}{s}+\frac{B}{s+4}}}\\ {{A=s V_{o}(s)\bigg|_{s=0}=\frac{125}{s+4}\bigg|_{s=0}=31.25}}\\ {{B=(s+4)V_{o}(s)\bigg|_{s=-4}=\frac{125}{s}\bigg|_{s=-4}=-31.25}}\\ {{V_{o}=\frac{31.25}{s}-\frac{31.25}{s+4}}}\end{array}
$$

Taking the inverse Laplace transform gives

$$
\nu_{o}(t) = 31.25(1 - e^{-4t})u(t)\mathrm{~V~}
$$

Notice that the values of  $\nu_{o}(0)$  and  $\nu_{o}(\infty)$  obtained in part (b) are confirmed.

Figure 16.17 For Practice Prob. 16.6.

For electrical networks, the transfer function is also known as the network function.

# 16.4 Transfer Functions

The transfer function is a key concept in signal processing because it indicates how a signal is processed as it passes through a network. It is a fitting tool for finding the network response, determining (or designing for) network stability, and network synthesis. The transfer function of a network describes how the output behaviors with respect to the input. It specifies the transfer from the input to the output in the  $s$ - domain, assuming no initial energy.

The transfer function  $H(s)$  is the ratio of the output response  $Y(s)$  to the input excitation  $X(s)$ , assuming all initial conditions are zero.

Thus,

$$
H(s) = \frac{Y(s)}{X(s)} \tag{16.15}
$$

Some authors would not consider Eqs. (16.16c) and (16.16d) transfer functions.

The transfer function depends on what we define as input and output. Because the input and output can be either current or voltage at any place in the circuit, there are four possible transfer functions:

$$
H(s) = \mathrm{Voltage~gain} = \frac{V_o(s)}{V_i(s)} \tag{16.16a}
$$

$$
H(s) = \mathrm{Current~gain} = \frac{I_o(s)}{I_i(s)} \tag{16.16b}
$$

$$
H(s) = \mathrm{Impedance} = \frac{V(s)}{I(s)} \tag{16.16c}
$$

$$
H(s) = \mathrm{Admittance} = \frac{I(s)}{V(s)} \tag{16.16d}
$$

Thus, a circuit can have many transfer functions. Note that  $H(s)$  is dimensionless in Eqs. (16.16a) and (16.16b).

Each of the transfer functions in Eq. (16.16) can be found in two ways. One way is to assume any convenient input  $X(s)$ , use any circuit analysis technique (such as current or voltage division, nodal or mesh analysis) to find the output  $Y(s)$ , and then obtain the ratio of the two. The other approach is to apply the ladder method, which involves walking our way through the circuit. By this approach, we assume that the output is  $1 \mathrm{~V}$  or  $1 \mathrm{~A}$  as appropriate and use the basic laws of Ohm and Kirchhoff (KCL only) to obtain the input. The transfer function becomes unity divided by the input. This approach may be more convenient to use when the circuit has many loops or nodes so that applying nodal or mesh analysis becomes cumbersome. In the first method, we assume an input and find the output; in the second method, we assume the output and find the input. In both methods, we calculate  $H(s)$  as the ratio of output to input transforms. The two methods rely on the linearity property, since we only deal with linear circuits in this book. Example 16.8 illustrates these methods.

Equation (16.15) assumes that both  $X(s)$  and  $Y(s)$  are known. Sometimes, we know the input  $X(s)$  and the transfer function  $H(s)$ . We find the output  $Y(s)$  as

$$
Y(s) = H(s)X(s) \tag{16.17}
$$

and take the inverse transform to get  $y(t)$ . A special case is when the input is the unit impulse function,  $x(t) = \delta (t)$ , so that  $X(s) = 1$ . For this case,

$$
Y(s) = H(s)\qquad \mathrm{or}\qquad y(t) = h(t) \tag{16.18}
$$

where

$$
h(t) = \mathcal{L}^{-1}[H(s)] \tag{16.19}
$$

The term  $h(t)$  represents the unit impulse response—it is the time- domain response of the network to a unit impulse. Thus, Eq. (16.19) provides a new interpretation for the transfer function:  $H(s)$  is the Laplace transform of the unit impulse response of the network. Once we know the impulse response  $h(t)$  of a network, we can obtain the response of the network to any input signal using Eq. (16.17) in the  $s$ - domain or using the convolution integral (section 15.5) in the time domain.

The unit impulse response is the output response of a circuit when the input is a unit impulse.

The output of a linear system is  $y(t) = 10e^{- t}\cos 4t u(t)$  when the input is  $x(t) = e^{- t}u(t)$ . Find the transfer function of the system and its impulse response.

# Solution:

If  $x(t) = e^{- t}u(t)$  and  $y(t) = 10e^{- t}\cos 4t u(t)$ , then

$$
X(s) = \frac{1}{s + 1}\qquad \mathrm{and}\qquad Y(s) = \frac{10(s + 1)}{(s + 1)^2 + 4^2}
$$

Hence,

$$
H(s) = \frac{Y(s)}{X(s)} = \frac{10(s + 1)^2}{(s + 1)^2 + 16} = \frac{10(s^2 + 2s + 1)}{s^2 + 2s + 17}
$$

To find  $h(t)$ , we write  $H(s)$  as

$$
H(s) = 10 - 40\frac{4}{(s + 1)^2 + 4^2}
$$

From Table 15.2, we obtain

$$
h(t) = 10\delta (t) - 40e^{-t}\sin 4t u(t)
$$

The transfer function of a linear system is

Practice Problem 16.7

$$
H(s) = \frac{2s}{s + 6}
$$

Find the output  $y(t)$  due to the input  $10e^{- 3t}u(t)$  and its impulse response.

Answer:  $- 20e^{- 3t} + 40e^{- 6t}$ ,  $t \geq 0$ ,  $2\delta (t) - 12e^{- 6t}u(t)$ .

Determine the transfer function  $H(s) = V_{o}(s) / I_{o}(s)$  of the circuit in Fig. 16.18.

# Solution:

METHOD 1 By current division,

$$
I_{2} = \frac{(s + 4)I_{o}}{s + 4 + 2 + 1 / 2s}
$$

But

$$
V_{o} = 2I_{2} = \frac{2(s + 4)I_{o}}{s + 6 + 1 / 2s}
$$

Hence,

$$
H(s) = \frac{V_{o}(s)}{I_{o}(s)} = \frac{4s(s + 4)}{2s^{2} + 12s + 1}
$$

METHOD 2 We can apply the ladder method. We let  $V_{o} = 1 \mathrm{~V}$ . By Ohm's law,  $I_{2} = V_{o} / 2 = 1 / 2 \mathrm{~A}$ . The voltage across the  $(2 + 1 / 2s)$  impedance is

$$
V_{1} = I_{2}\left(2 + \frac{1}{2s}\right) = 1 + \frac{1}{4s} = \frac{4s + 1}{4s}
$$

This is the same as the voltage across the  $(s + 4)$  impedance. Hence,

$$
I_{1} = \frac{V_{1}}{s + 4} = \frac{4s + 1}{4s(s + 4)}
$$

Applying KCL at the top node yields

$$
I_{o} = I_{1} + I_{2} = \frac{4s + 1}{4s(s + 4)} + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{2s^{2} + 12s + 1}{4s(s + 4)}
$$

Hence,

$$
H(s) = \frac{V_{o}}{I_{o}} = \frac{1}{I_{o}} = \frac{4s(s + 4)}{2s^{2} + 12s + 1}
$$

as before.

Practice Problem 16.8 Find the transfer function  $H(s) = I_{1}(s) / I_{o}(s)$  in the circuit of Fig. 16.18.

Answer:  $\frac{4s + 1}{2s^{2} + 12s + 1}$ .

For the  $s$ - domain circuit in Fig. 16.19, find: (a) the transfer function  $H(s) = V_{o} / V_{i}$ , (b) the impulse response, (c) the response when  $\nu_{i}(t) = u(t) \mathrm{V}$ , (d) the response when  $\nu_{i}(t) = 8 \cos 2t \mathrm{V}$ .

# Solution:

(a) Using voltage division,

$$
V_{o} = \frac{1}{s + 1} V_{ab} \tag{16.9.1}
$$

But

$$
V_{ab} = \frac{1\| (s + 1)}{1 + 1\| (s + 1)} V_{i} = \frac{(s + 1) / (s + 2)}{1 + (s + 1) / (s + 2)} V_{i}
$$

or

$$
V_{ab} = \frac{s + 1}{2s + 3} V_{i} \tag{16.9.2}
$$

Substituting Eq. (16.9.2) into Eq. (16.9.1) results in

$$
V_{o} = \frac{V_{i}}{2s + 3}
$$

Thus, the transfer function is

$$
H(s) = \frac{V_{o}}{V_{i}} = \frac{1}{2s + 3}
$$

(b) We may write  $H(s)$  as

$$
H(s) = \frac{1}{2} \frac{1}{s + \frac{3}{2}}
$$

Its inverse Laplace transform is the required impulse response:

$$
h(t) = \frac{1}{2} e^{-3t / 2} u(t)
$$

(c) When  $\nu_{i}(t) = u(t)$ ,  $V_{i}(s) = 1 / s$ , and

$$
V_{o}(s) = H(s) V_{i}(s) = \frac{1}{2s(s + \frac{3}{2})} = \frac{A}{s} + \frac{B}{s + \frac{3}{2}}
$$

where

$$
A = s V_{o}(s)\big|_{s = 0} = \frac{1}{2(s + \frac{3}{2})}\bigg|_{s = 0} = \frac{1}{3}
$$

$$
B = \left(s + \frac{3}{2}\right) V_{o}(s)\bigg|_{s = -3 / 2} = \frac{1}{2s}\bigg|_{s = -3 / 2} = -\frac{1}{3}
$$

Hence, for  $\nu_{i}(t) = u(t)$ ,

$$
V_{o}(s) = \frac{1}{3}\left(\frac{1}{s} - \frac{1}{s + \frac{3}{2}}\right)
$$

and its inverse Laplace transform is

$$
\nu_{o}(t) = \frac{1}{3} (1 - e^{-3t / 2}) u(t) \mathrm{V}
$$

For Example 16.9.

(d) When  $\nu_{i}(t) = 8\cos 2t$ , then  $V_{i}(s) = \frac{8s}{s^{2} + 4}$ , and

$$
V_{o}(s) = H(s)V_{i}(s) = \frac{4s}{(s + \frac{3}{2})(s^{2} + 4)} \tag{16.9.3}
$$

where

$$
A = \Big(s + \frac{3}{2}\Big)V_{o}(s)\Big|_{s = -3 / 2} = \frac{4s}{s^{2} + 4}\Big|_{s = -3 / 2} = -\frac{24}{25}
$$

To get  $B$  and  $C$ , we multiply Eq. (16.9.3) by  $(s + 3 / 2)(s^{2} + 4)$ . We get

$$
4s = A(s^{2} + 4) + B\Big(s^{2} + \frac{3}{2} s\Big) + C\Big(s + \frac{3}{2}\Big)
$$

Equating coefficients,

$$
\begin{array}{l l l}{{\mathrm{Constant:}}}&{{0=4A+\frac{3}{2}C}}&{{\Rightarrow}}&{{C=-\frac{8}{3}A}}\\ {{s:}}&{{4=\frac{3}{2}B+C}}&{{}}&{{}}\\ {{s^{2}:}}&{{0=A+B}}&{{\Rightarrow}}&{{B=-A}}\end{array}
$$

Solving these gives  $A = - 24 / 25$ ,  $B = 24 / 25$ ,  $C = 64 / 25$ . Hence, for  $\nu_{i}(t) = 8\cos 2t$  V,

$$
V_{o}(s) = \frac{-\frac{24}{25}}{s + \frac{3}{2}} +\frac{24}{25}\frac{s}{s^{2} + 4} +\frac{32}{25}\frac{2}{s^{2} + 4}
$$

and its inverse is

$$
\nu_{o}(t) = \frac{24}{25}\Bigl (-e^{-3t / 2} + \cos 2t + \frac{4}{3}\sin 2t\Bigr)u(t)\mathrm{~V~}
$$

# 16.5 State Variables

Thus far in this book we have considered techniques for analyzing systems with only one input and only one output. Many engineering systems have many inputs and many outputs, as shown in Fig. 16.21. The state variable method is a very important tool in analyzing systems and understanding such highly complex systems. Thus, the state variable model is more general than the single- input, single- output model, such as a transfer function. Although the topic cannot be adequately covered in one chapter, let alone one section of a chapter, we will cover it briefly at this point.

In the state variable model, we specify a collection of variables that describe the internal behavior of the system. These variables are known as the state variables of the system. They are the variables that determine the future behavior of a system when the present state of the system and the input signals are known. In other words, they are those variables which, if known, allow all other system parameters to be determined by using only algebraic equations.

A state variable is a physical property that characterizes the state of a system, regardless of how the system got to that state.

Common examples of state variables are the pressure, volume, and temperature. In an electric circuit, the state variables are the inductor current and capacitor voltage since they collectively describe the energy state of the system.

The standard way to represent the state equations is to arrange them as a set of first- order differential equations:

$$
\dot{\mathbf{x}} = \mathbf{Ax} + \mathbf{Bz} \tag{16.20}
$$

where

$$
\dot{\mathbf{x}} (t) = \left[ \begin{array}{c}x_{1}(t)\\ x_{2}(t)\\ \vdots \\ x_{n}(t) \end{array} \right] = \mathrm{state~vector~representing~}n\mathrm{~state~vector~}
$$

and the dot represents the first derivative with respect to time, i.e.,

$$
\dot{\mathbf{x}} (t) = \left[ \begin{array}{c}\dot{x}_1(t)\\ \dot{x}_2(t)\\ \vdots \\ \dot{x}_n(t) \end{array} \right]
$$

and

$$
\mathbf{z}(t) = \left[ \begin{array}{c}z_{1}(t)\\ z_{2}(t)\\ \vdots \\ z_{m}(t) \end{array} \right] = \mathrm{input~vector~representing~}m\mathrm{~inputs}
$$

A and  $\mathbf{B}$  are respectively  $n \times n$  and  $n \times m$  matrices. In addition to the state equation in Eq. (16.20), we need the output equation. The complete state model or state space is

$$
\begin{array}{r}\dot{\mathbf{x}} = \mathbf{Ax} + \mathbf{Bz}\\ \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{Cx} + \mathbf{Dz} \end{array} \tag{16.21b}
$$

where

$$
\mathbf{y}(t) = \left[ \begin{array}{c}y_{1}(t)\\ y_{2}(t)\\ \vdots \\ y_{p}(t) \end{array} \right] = \mathrm{the~output~vector~representing~}p\mathrm{~output~}
$$

and  $\mathbf{C}$  and  $\mathbf{D}$  are, respectively,  $p \times n$  and  $p \times m$  matrices. For the special case of single- input single- output,  $n = m = p = 1$ .

Assuming zero initial conditions, the transfer function of the system is found by taking the Laplace transform of Eq. (16.21a); we obtain

$$
s\mathbf{X}(s) = \mathbf{A}\mathbf{X}(s) + \mathbf{B}\mathbf{Z}(s) \qquad \rightarrow \qquad (s\mathbf{I} - \mathbf{A})\mathbf{X}(s) = \mathbf{B}\mathbf{Z}(s)
$$

or

$$
\mathbf{X}(s) = (s\mathbf{I} - \mathbf{A})^{-1}\mathbf{B}\mathbf{Z}(s) \tag{16.22}
$$

where  $\mathbf{I}$  is the identity matrix. Taking the Laplace transform of Eq. (16.21b) yields

$$
\mathbf{Y}(s) = \mathbf{C}\mathbf{X}(s) + \mathbf{D}\mathbf{Z}(s) \tag{16.23}
$$

Substituting Eq. (16.22) into Eq. (16.23) and dividing by  $\mathbf{Z}(s)$  gives the transfer function as

$$
\mathbf{H}(s) = \frac{\mathbf{Y}(s)}{\mathbf{Z}(s)} = \mathbf{C}(s\mathbf{I} - \mathbf{A})^{-1}\mathbf{B} + \mathbf{D} \tag{16.24}
$$

where

$\mathbf{A} =$  system matrix

$\mathbf{B} =$  input coupling matrix

$\mathbf{C} =$  output matrix

$\mathbf{D} =$  feedforward matrix

In most cases,  $\mathbf{D} = \mathbf{0}$ , so the degree of the numerator of  $H(s)$  in Eq. (16.24) is less than that of the denominator. Thus,

$$
\mathbf{H}(s) = \mathbf{C}(s\mathbf{I} - \mathbf{A})^{-1}\mathbf{B} \tag{16.25}
$$

Because of the matrix computation involved, MATLAB can be used to find the transfer function.

To apply state variable analysis to a circuit, we follow the following three steps.

# Steps to Apply the State Variable Method to Circuit Analysis:

1. Select the inductor current  $i$  and capacitor voltage  $\nu$  as the state variables, making sure they are consistent with the passive sign convention.

2. Apply KCL and KVL to the circuit and obtain circuit variables (voltages and currents) in terms of the state variables. This should lead to a set of first-order differential equations necessary and sufficient to determine all state variables.

3. Obtain the output equation and put the final result in state-space representation.

Steps 1 and 3 are usually straightforward; the major task is in step 2. We will illustrate this with examples.

Find the state- space representation of the circuit in Fig. 16.22. Determine the transfer function of the circuit when  $\nu_{s}$  is the input and  $i_{x}$  is the output. Take  $R = 1\Omega$ ,  $C = 0.25\mathrm{F}$ , and  $L = 0.5\mathrm{H}$ .

# Solution:

We select the inductor current  $i$  and capacitor voltage  $\nu$  as the state variables.

$$
\nu_{L} = L\frac{di}{dt} \tag{16.10.1}
$$

$$
i_{C} = C\frac{d\nu}{dt} \tag{16.10.2}
$$

Applying KCL at node 1 gives

$$
i = i_{x} + i_{C}\quad \rightarrow \quad C\frac{d\nu}{dt} = i - \frac{\nu}{R}
$$

or

$$
\dot{\nu} = -\frac{\nu}{RC} +\frac{i}{C} \tag{16.10.3}
$$

since the same voltage  $\nu$  is across both  $R$  and  $C$ . Applying KVL around the outer loop yields

$$
\begin{array}{rcl}\nu_{s} & = & \nu_{L} + \nu \quad \rightarrow \quad L\frac{di}{dt} = -\nu +\nu_{s} \\ i & = & -\frac{\nu}{L} +\frac{\nu_{s}}{L} \end{array} \tag{16.10.4}
$$

Equations (16.10.3) and (16.10.4) constitute the state equations. If we regard  $i_{x}$  as the output,

$$
i_{x} = \frac{\nu}{R} \tag{16.10.5}
$$

Putting Eqs. (16.10.3), (16.10.4), and (16.10.5) in the standard form leads to

$$
\begin{array}{r}\left[ \begin{array}{l}\dot{\nu}\\ \vdots \\ \frac{1}{L} \end{array} \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{ll}\frac{-1}{RC} & \frac{1}{C}\\ \frac{-1}{L} & 0 \end{array} \right]\left[ \begin{array}{l}\nu \\ i \end{array} \right] + \left[ \begin{array}{l}0\\ \frac{1}{L} \end{array} \right]\nu_{s}\\ i_{x} = \left[ \begin{array}{ll}1 & 0\\ \frac{1}{R} & 0 \end{array} \right]\left[ \begin{array}{l}\nu \\ i \end{array} \right] \end{array} \tag{16.10.6b}
$$

If  $R = 1$ ,  $C = \frac{1}{\lambda}$ , and  $L = \frac{1}{2}$ , we obtain from Eq. (16.10.6) matrices

$$
\begin{array}{r}\mathbf{A} = \left[ \begin{array}{ll} - 1 & \frac{1}{C}\\ \frac{RC}{L} & 0 \end{array} \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{ll} - 4 & 4\\ -2 & 0 \end{array} \right],\qquad \mathbf{B} = \left[ \begin{array}{l}0\\ \frac{1}{L} \end{array} \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{l}0\\ 2 \end{array} \right],\\ \mathbf{C} = \left[ \begin{array}{ll}1 & 0\\ \frac{1}{R} & 0 \end{array} \right] = [1 & 0] \end{array}
$$

$$
s\mathbf{I} - \mathbf{A} = \left[ \begin{array}{ll}s & 0\\ 0 & s \end{array} \right] - \left[ \begin{array}{ll} - 4 & 4\\ -2 & 0 \end{array} \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{ll}s + 4 & -4\\ 2 & s \end{array} \right]
$$

Taking the inverse of this gives

$$
(s\mathbf{I} - \mathbf{A})^{-1} = \frac{\mathrm{adjoint~of~}\mathbf{A}}{\mathrm{determinant~of~}\mathbf{A}} = \frac{\left[ \begin{array}{cc}s & 4\\ -2 & s + 4 \end{array} \right]}{s^2 + 4s + 8}
$$

Figure 16.22 For Example 16.10.

# Example 16.10

Thus, the transfer function is given by

$$
\begin{array}{r}{\mathbf{H}(s) = \mathbf{C}(s\mathbf{I} - \mathbf{A})^{-1}\mathbf{B} = \frac{[1\quad0]\left[ \begin{array}{c c}{s} & {4}\\ {-2} & {s + 4} \end{array} \right]\left[ \begin{array}{c}{0}\\ {2} \end{array} \right]}{s^{2} + 4s + 8} = \frac{[1\quad0]\left[ \begin{array}{c}{8}\\ {2s + 8} \end{array} \right]}{s^{2} + 4s + 8}}\\ {= \frac{8}{s^{2} + 4s + 8}} \end{array}
$$

which is the same thing we would get by directly Laplace transforming the circuit and obtaining  $\mathbf{H}(s) = I_{x}(s) / V_{s}(s)$ . The real advantage of the state variable approach comes with multiple inputs and multiple outputs. In this case, we have one input  $\nu_{s}$  and one output  $i_{x}$ . In the next example, we will have two inputs and two outputs.

Consider the circuit in Fig. 16.24, which may be regarded as a two- input, two- output system. Determine the state variable model and find the transfer function of the system.

Figure 16.24 For Example 16.11.

# Solution:

In this case, we have two inputs  $\nu_{s}$  and  $\nu_{i}$  and two outputs  $\nu_{o}$  and  $i_{o}$ . Again, we select the inductor current  $i$  and capacitor voltage  $\nu$  as the state variables. Applying KVL around the left- hand loop gives

$$
-\nu_{s} + i_{1} + \frac{1}{6} i = 0 \quad \rightarrow \quad i = 6\nu_{s} - 6i_{1} \tag{16.11.1}
$$

We need to eliminate  $i_{1}$ . Applying KVL around the loop containing  $\nu_{s}, 1 - \Omega$  resistor,  $2 - \Omega$  resistor, and  $\frac{1}{3} - \mathrm{F}$  capacitor yields

$$
\nu_{s} = i_{1} + \nu_{o} + \nu \tag{16.11.2}
$$

But at node 1, KCL gives

$$
i_{1} = i + \frac{\nu_{o}}{2} \quad \rightarrow \quad \nu_{o} = 2(i_{1} - i) \tag{16.11.3}
$$

Substituting this in Eq. (16.11.2),

$$
\nu_{s} = 3i_{1} + \nu -2i \rightarrow i_{1} = \frac{2i - \nu + \nu_{s}}{3} \tag{16.11.4}
$$

Substituting this in Eq. (16.11.1) gives

$$
i = 2\nu -4i + 4\nu_{s} \tag{16.11.5}
$$

which is one state equation. To obtain the second one, we apply KCL at node 2.

$$
\frac{\nu_{o}}{2} = \frac{1}{3}\nu +i_{o} \rightarrow \nu = \frac{3}{2}\nu_{o} - 3i_{o} \tag{16.11.6}
$$

We need to eliminate  $\nu_{o}$  and  $i_{o}$ . From the right- hand loop, it is evident that

$$
i_{o} = \frac{\nu - \nu_{i}}{3} \tag{16.11.7}
$$

Substituting Eq. (16.11.4) into Eq. (16.11.3) gives

$$
\nu_{o} = 2\left(\frac{2i - \nu + \nu_{s}}{3} -i\right) = -\frac{2}{3} (\nu +i - \nu_{s}) \tag{16.11.8}
$$

Substituting Eqs. (16.11.7) and (16.11.8) into Eq. (16.11.6) yields the second state equation as

$$
\dot{\nu} = -2\nu -i + \nu_{s} + \nu_{i} \tag{16.11.9}
$$

The two output equations are already obtained in Eqs. (16.11.7) and (16.11.8). Putting Eqs. (16.11.5) and (16.11.7) to (16.11.9) together in the standard form leads to the state model for the circuit, namely,

$$
\left[ \begin{array}{c}\dot{\nu} \\ i \end{array} \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{cc} - 2 & -1 \\ 2 & -4 \end{array} \right]\left[ \begin{array}{c}\nu \\ i \end{array} \right] + \left[ \begin{array}{cc}1 & 1 \\ 4 & 0 \end{array} \right]\left[ \begin{array}{c}\nu_{s} \\ \nu_{i} \end{array} \right] \tag{16.11.10a}
$$

$$
\left[ \begin{array}{c}\nu_{o} \\ i_{o} \end{array} \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{cc} - \frac{2}{3} & -\frac{2}{3} \\ \frac{1}{3} & 0 \end{array} \right]\left[ \begin{array}{c}\nu \\ i \end{array} \right] + \left[ \begin{array}{cc}\frac{2}{3} & 0 \\ 0 & -\frac{1}{3} \end{array} \right]\left[ \begin{array}{c}\nu_{s} \\ \nu_{i} \end{array} \right] \tag{16.11.10b}
$$

For the electric circuit in Fig. 16.25, determine the state model. Take  $\nu_{o}$  and  $i_{o}$  as the output variables.

\frac{d^{2}y(t)}{d t^{2}} +3\frac{d y(t)}{d t} +2y(t) = 5z(t) \tag{16.12.1}
$$

Obtain the state model and the transfer function of the system.

# Solution:

First, we select the state variables. Let  $x_{1} = y(t)$  , therefore

$$
\dot{x}_{1} = \dot{y} (t) \tag{16.12.2}
$$

Now let

$$
x_{2} = \dot{x}_{1} = \dot{y} (t) \tag{16.12.3}
$$

Note that at this time we are looking at a second- order system that would normally have two first- order terms in the solution.

Now we have  $\dot{x}_{2} = \ddot{y} (t)$  , where we can find the value  $\dot{x}_{2}$  from Eq. (16.12.1), i.e.,

$$
\dot{x}_{2} = \ddot{y} (t) = -2y(t) - 3\dot{y} (t) + 5z(t) = -2x_{1} - 3x_{2} + 5z(t) \tag{16.12.4}
$$

From Eqs. (16.12.2) to (16.12.4), we can now write the following matrix equations:

$$
{\begin{array}{r l}&{{\left[\begin{array}{l}{\dot{x}_{1}}\\ {\dot{x}_{2}}\end{array}\right]}={\left[\begin{array}{l l}{0}&{1}\\ {-2}&{-3}\end{array}\right]}{\left[\begin{array}{l}{x_{1}}\\ {x_{2}}\end{array}\right]}+{\left[\begin{array}{l}{0}\\ {5}\end{array}\right]}z(t)}\\ &{\qquad{\mathbf{y}}(t)=[1\quad0]{\left[\begin{array}{l}{x_{1}}\\ {x_{2}}\end{array}\right]}}\end{array}} \tag{16.12.5}
$$

We now obtain the transfer function.

$$
s\mathbf{I}-\mathbf{A}=s{\left[\begin{array}{l l}{1}&{0}\\ {0}&{1}\end{array}\right]}-{\left[\begin{array}{l l}{0}&{1}\\ {-2}&{-3}\end{array}\right]}={\left[\begin{array}{l l}{s}&{-1}\\ {2}&{s+3}\end{array}\right]}
$$

The inverse is

$$
(s\mathbf{I} - \mathbf{A})^{-1} = \frac{\left[{\begin{array}{c c}{s + 3} & 1\\ {-2} & {s}\end{array}}\right]}{s(s + 3) + 2}
$$

The transfer function is

$$
\begin{array}{r l r} & {} & {\mathbf{H}(s) = \mathbf{C}(s\mathbf{I} - \mathbf{A})^{-1}\mathbf{B} = \frac{(1\quad0){\left[ \begin{array}{l l}{s + 3} & 1\\ {-2} & {s} \end{array} \right]}{\left( \begin{array}{l}{0}\\ {5} \end{array} \right)} = \frac{(1\quad0){\left( \begin{array}{l}{5}\\ {5s} \end{array} \right)}}{s(s + 3) + 2}}\\ & {} & {= \frac{5}{(s + 1)(s + 2)}} \end{array}
$$

To check this, we directly apply the Laplace transfer to each term in Eq. (16.12.1). Given that initial conditions are zero, we get

$$
[s^{2} + 3s + 2]Y(s) = 5Z(s)\quad \rightarrow \quad H(s) = \frac{Y(s)}{Z(s)} = \frac{5}{s^{2} + 3s + 2}
$$

which is in agreement with what we got previously.

Develop a set of state variable equations that represent the following differential equation,

$$
\frac{d^3y}{dt^3} +18\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} +20\frac{dy}{dt} +5y = z(t)
$$

# Answer:

$$
\mathbf{A} = \left[ \begin{array}{ccc}0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\ -5 & -20 & -18 \end{array} \right], \qquad \mathbf{B} = \left[ \begin{array}{c}0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{array} \right], \qquad \mathbf{C} = [1 \quad 0 \quad 0].
$$

# 16.6 Applications

So far we have considered three applications of Laplace's transform: circuit analysis in general, obtaining transfer functions, and solving linear integrodifferential equations. The Laplace transform also finds application in other areas in circuit analysis, signal processing, and control systems. Here we will consider two more important applications: network stability and network synthesis.

# 16.6.1 Network Stability

A circuit is stable if its impulse response  $h(t)$  is bounded (i.e.,  $h(t)$  converges to a finite value) as  $t \to \infty$ ; it is unstable if  $h(t)$  grows without bound as  $t \to \infty$ . In mathematical terms, a circuit is stable when

$$
\lim_{t\to \infty}|h(t)| = \mathrm{finite} \tag{16.26}
$$

Because the transfer function  $H(s)$  is the Laplace transform of the impulse response  $h(t), H(s)$  must meet certain requirements for Eq. (16.26) to hold. Recall that  $H(s)$  may be written as

$$
H(s) = \frac{N(s)}{D(s)} \tag{16.27}
$$

where the roots of  $N(s) = 0$  are called the zeros of  $H(s)$  because they make  $H(s) = 0$ , while the roots of  $D(s) = 0$  are called the poles of  $H(s)$  since they cause  $H(s) \to \infty$ . The zeros and poles of  $H(s)$  are often located in the  $s$  plane as shown in Fig. 16.26(a). Recall from Eqs. (15.47) and (15.48) that  $H(s)$  may also be written in terms of its poles as

$$
H(s) = \frac{N(s)}{D(s)} = \frac{N(s)}{(s + p_1)(s + p_2)\cdots(s + p_n)} \tag{16.28}
$$

$H(s)$  must meet two requirements for the circuit to be stable. First, the degree of  $N(s)$  must be less than the degree of  $D(s)$ ; otherwise, long division would produce

$$
H(s) = k_{n}s^{n} + k_{n - 1}s^{n - 1} + \dots + k_{1}s + k_{0} + \frac{R(s)}{D(s)} \tag{16.29}
$$

where the degree of  $R(s)$ , the remainder of the long division, is less than the degree of  $D(s)$ . The inverse of  $H(s)$  in Eq. (16.29) does not meet the condition in Eq. (16.26). Second, all the poles of  $H(s)$  in

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-14/63c420e9-9220-47ad-935a-09e6b2aeb2a8/ea05d09f2d5af3999c4867730876ce2b4b2da8c5041aa4292f350573a9ad9b76.jpg)  
Figure 16.26 The complex  $s$  plane: (a) poles and zeros plotted, (b) left-half plane.

Eq. (16.27) (i.e., all the roots of  $D(s) = 0$ ) must have negative real parts; in other words, all the poles must lie in the left half of the  $s$  plane, as shown typically in Fig. 16.26(b). The reason for this will be apparent if we take the inverse Laplace transform of  $H(s)$  in Eq. (16.27). Because Eq. (16.27) is similar to Eq. (15.48), its partial fraction expansion is similar to the one in Eq. (15.49) so that the inverse of  $H(s)$  is similar to that in Eq. (15.53). Hence,

$$
h(t) = (k_{1}e^{-p_{1}t} + k_{2}e^{-p_{2}t} + \dots +k_{n}e^{-p_{n}t})u(t) \tag{16.30}
$$

We see from this equation that each pole  $p_{i}$  must be positive (i.e., pole  $s = - p_{i}$  in the left- half plane) for  $e^{- p_{i}t}$  to decrease with increasing  $t$ . Thus,

A circuit is stable when all the poles of its transfer function  $H(s)$  lie in the left half of the  $s$  plane.

An unstable circuit never reaches steady state because the transient response does not decay to zero. Consequently, steady- state analysis is only applicable to stable circuits.

A circuit made up exclusively of passive elements  $(R,L,$  and  $C$  and independent sources cannot be unstable, because that would imply that some branch currents or voltages would grow indefinitely with sources set to zero. Passive elements cannot generate such indefinite growth. Passive circuits either are stable or have poles with zero real parts. To show that this is the case, consider the series  $RLC$  circuit in Fig. 16.27. The transfer function is given by

$$
H(s) = \frac{V_{o}}{V_{s}} = \frac{1 / s C}{R + s L + 1 / s C}
$$

or

$$
H(s) = \frac{1 / L}{s^{2} + s R / L + 1 / L C} \tag{16.31}
$$

Notice that  $D(s) = s^{2} + s R / L + 1 / L C = 0$  is the same as the characteristic equation obtained for the series  $RLC$  circuit in Eq. (8.8). The circuit has poles at

$$
p_{1,2} = -\alpha \pm \sqrt{\alpha^{2} - \omega_{0}^{2}} \tag{16.32}
$$

where

$$
\alpha = \frac{R}{2L}, \qquad \omega_{0} = \frac{1}{L C}
$$

For  $R,L,C > 0$ , the two poles always lie in the left half of the  $s$  plane, implying that the circuit is always stable. However, when  $R = 0$ ,  $\alpha = 0$  and the circuit becomes unstable. Although ideally this is possible, it does not really happen, because  $R$  is never zero.

On the other hand, active circuits or passive circuits with controlled sources can supply energy, and they can be unstable. In fact, an oscillator is a typical example of a circuit designed to be unstable. An oscillator is designed such that its transfer function is of the form

$$
H(s) = \frac{N(s)}{s^{2} + \omega_{0}^{2}} = \frac{N(s)}{(s + j \omega_{0})(s - j \omega_{0})} \tag{16.33}
$$

so that its output is sinusoidal.

Determine the values of  $k$  for which the circuit in Fig. 16.28 is stable.

# Solution:

Applying mesh analysis to the first- order circuit in Fig. 16.28 gives

$$
V_{i} = \Big(R + \frac{1}{s C}\Big)I_{1} - \frac{I_{2}}{s C} \tag{16.13.1}
$$

and

$$
0 = -k I_{1} + \Big(R + \frac{1}{s C}\Big)I_{2} - \frac{I_{1}}{s C}
$$

or

$$
0 = -\Big(k + \frac{1}{s C}\Big)I_{1} + \Big(R + \frac{1}{s C}\Big)I_{2} \tag{16.13.2}
$$

We can write Eqs. (16.13.1) and (16.13.2) in matrix form as

$$
\left[ \begin{array}{c} V_{i} \\ 0 \end{array} \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{cc} \left(R + \frac{1}{s C}\right) & -\frac{1}{s C} \\ -\left(k + \frac{1}{s C}\right) & \left(R + \frac{1}{s C}\right) \end{array} \right] \left[ \begin{array}{c} I_{1} \\ I_{2} \end{array} \right]
$$

The determinant is

$$
\Delta = \Big(R + \frac{1}{s C}\Big)^{2} - \frac{k}{s C} -\frac{1}{s^{2}C^{2}} = \frac{s R^{2}C + 2R - k}{s C} \tag{16.13.3}
$$

The characteristic equation  $(\Delta = 0)$  gives the single pole as

$$
p = \frac{k - 2R}{R^{2}C}
$$

which is negative when  $k< 2R$ . Thus, we conclude the circuit is stable when  $k< 2R$  and unstable for  $k > 2R$ .

For what value of  $\beta$  is the circuit in Fig. 16.29 stable?

Answer:  $\beta > - 1 / R$

An active filter has the transfer function

$$
H(s) = \frac{k}{s^{2} + s(4 - k) + 1}
$$

For what values of  $k$  is the filter stable?

# Solution:

As a second- order circuit,  $H(s)$  may be written as

$$
H(s) = \frac{N(s)}{s^{2} + b s + c}
$$

where  $b = 4 - k,c = 1$  , and  $N(s) = k$  . This has poles at  $p^{2} + b p + c = 0$  that is,

$$
p_{1,2} = \frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^{2} - 4c}}{2}
$$

For the circuit to be stable, the poles must be located in the left half of the  $s$  plane. This implies that  $b > 0$

Applying this to the given  $H(s)$  means that for the circuit to be stable,  $4 - k > 0$  or  $k< 4$

# Practice Problem 16.14

A second- order active circuit has the transfer function

$$
H(s) = \frac{1}{s^{2} + s(25 + \alpha) + 25}
$$

Find the range of the values of  $\alpha$  for which the circuit is stable. What is the value of  $\alpha$  that will cause oscillation?

Answer:  $\alpha > - 25$ $\alpha = - 25$

# 16.6.2 Network Synthesis

Network synthesis may be regarded as the process of obtaining an appropriate network to represent a given transfer function. Network synthesis is easier in the  $s$  - domain than in the time domain.

In network analysis, we find the transfer function of a given network. In network synthesis, we reverse the approach: Given a transfer function, we are required to find a suitable network.

Network synthesis is finding a network that represents a given transfer function.

Keep in mind that in synthesis, there may be many different answers- or possibly no answers- because there are many circuits that can be used to represent the same transfer function; in network analysis, there is only one answer.

Network synthesis is an exciting field of prime engineering importance. Being able to look at a transfer function and come up with the type of circuit it represents is a great asset to a circuit designer. Although network synthesis constitutes a whole course by itself and requires some experience, the following examples are meant to stimulate your appetite.

Given the transfer function

$$
H(s) = \frac{V_{o}(s)}{V_{i}(s)} = \frac{10}{s^{2} + 3s + 10}
$$

realize the function using the circuit in Fig. 16.30(a). (a) Select  $R = 5 \Omega$ , and find  $L$  and  $C$ . (b) Select  $R = 1 \Omega$ , and find  $L$  and  $C$ .

# Solution:

1. Define. The problem is clearly and completely defined. This problem is what we call a synthesis problem. Given a transfer function, synthesize a circuit that produces the given transfer function. However, to keep the problem more manageable, we give a circuit that produces the desired transfer function.

Had one of the variables,  $R$  in this case, not been given a value, then the problem would have had an infinite number of answers. An open- ended problem of this kind would require some additional assumptions that would have narrowed the set of solutions.

2. Present. A transfer function of the voltage out versus the voltage in is equal to  $10 / (s^{2} + 3s + 10)$ . A circuit, Fig. 16.30, is also given that should be able to produce the required transfer function. Two different values of  $R$ ,  $5$ , and  $1 \Omega$ , are to be used to calculate the values of  $L$  and  $C$  that produce the given transfer function.

3. Alternative. All solution paths involve determining the transfer function of Fig. 16.30 and then matching the various terms of the transfer function. Two approaches would be to use mesh analysis or nodal analysis. Because we are looking for a ratio of voltages, nodal analysis makes the most sense.

4. Attempt. Using nodal analysis leads to

$$
\frac{V_{o}(s) - V_{i}(s)}{sL} + \frac{V_{o}(s) - 0}{1 / (sC)} + \frac{V_{o}(s) - 0}{R} = 0
$$

Now multiply through by  $sLR$ :

$$
R V_{o}(s) - R V_{i}(s) + s^{2}R L C V_{o}(s) + s L V_{o}(s) = 0
$$

Collecting terms we get

$$
(s^{2}RLC + sL + R)V_{o}(s) = RV_{i}(s)
$$

or

$$
\frac{V_{o}(s)}{V_{i}(s)} = \frac{1 / (LC)}{s^{2} + [1 / (RC)]s + 1 / (LC)}
$$

Matching the two transfer functions produces two equations with three unknowns.

$$
L C = 0.1\qquad \mathrm{or}\qquad L = \frac{0.1}{C}
$$

and

$$
R C = \frac{1}{3}\qquad \mathrm{or}\qquad C = \frac{1}{3R}
$$

We have a constraint equation,  $R = 5 \Omega$  for (a) and  $= 1 \Omega$  for (b).

(a)  $C = 1 / (3 \times 5) = 66.67 \mathrm{mF}$  and  $L = 1.5 \mathrm{H}$

(b)  $C = 1 / (3 \times 1) = 333.3 \mathrm{mF}$  and  $L = 300 \mathrm{mH}$

Figure 16.30 For Example 16.15.

5. Evaluate. There are different ways of checking the answer. Solving for the transfer function by using mesh analysis seems the most straightforward and the approach we could use here. However, it should be pointed out that this is mathematically more complex and will take longer than the original nodal analysis approach. Other approaches also exist. We can assume an input for  $\nu_{i}(t)$ ,  $\nu_{i}(t) = u(t)$  V and, using either nodal analysis or mesh analysis, see if we get the same answer we would get with just using the transfer function. That is the approach we will try using mesh analysis.Let  $\nu_{i}(t) = u(t)$ $V$  or  $V_{i}(s) = 1 / s$ . This will produce

Let  $\nu_{i}(t) = u(t)$ $V$  or  $V_{i}(s) = 1 / s$  . This will produce

$$
V_{o}(s) = 10 / (s^{3} + 3s^{2} + 10s)
$$

Based on Fig. 16.30, mesh analysis leads to

(a) For loop 1,

$$
-(1 / s) + 1.5sI_{1} + [1 / (0.06667s)](I_{1} - I_{2}) = 0
$$

or

$$
(1.5s^{2} + 15)I_{1} - 15I_{2} = 1
$$

For loop 2,

$$
(15 / s)(I_{2} - I_{1}) + 5I_{2} = 0
$$

or

$$
-15I_{1} + (5s + 15)I_{2} = 0\qquad \mathrm{or}\qquad I_{1} = (0.3333s + 1)I_{2}
$$

Substituting into the first equation we get

$$
(0.5s^{3} + 1.5s^{2} + 5s + 15)I_{2} - 15I_{2} = 1
$$

or

$$
I_{2} = 2 / (s^{3} + 3s^{2} + 10s)
$$

but

$$
V_{o}(s) = 5I_{2} = 10 / (s^{3} + 3s^{2} + 10s)
$$

and the answer checks.

(b) For loop 1,

$$
-(1 / s) + 0.3sI_{1} + [1 / (0.3333s)](I_{1} - I_{2}) = 0
$$

or

$$
(0.3s^{2} + 3)I_{1} - 3I_{2} = 1
$$

For loop 2,

$$
(3 / s)(I_{2} - I_{1}) + I_{2} = 0
$$

or

$$
-3I_{1} + (s + 3)I_{2} = 0\qquad \mathrm{or}\qquad I_{1} = (0.3333s + 1)I_{2}
$$

Substituting into the first equation we get

$$
(0.09999s^{3} + 0.3s^{2} + s + 3)I_{2} - 3I_{2} = 1
$$

or

$$
I_{2} = 10 / (s^{3} + 3s^{2} + 10s)
$$

but  $V_{o}(s) = 1 \times I_{2} = 10 / (s^{3} + 3s^{2} + 10s)$  and the answer checks.

6. Satisfactory? We have clearly identified values of  $L$  and  $C$  for each of the conditions. In addition, we have carefully checked the answers to see if they are correct. The problem has been adequately solved. The results can now be presented as a solution to the problem.

Realize the function

$$
G(s) = \frac{V_{o}(s)}{V_{i}(s)} = \frac{4s}{s^{2} + 4s + 20}
$$

using the circuit in Fig. 16.31. Select  $R = 2 \Omega$ , and determine  $L$  and  $C$ .

Answer:  $500 \mathrm{mH}$ ,  $100 \mathrm{mF}$ .

Figure 16.32 For Example 16.16.

# Solution:

We apply nodal analysis to nodes 1 and 2. At node 1,

$$
(V_{s} - V_{1})Y_{1} = (V_{1} - V_{o})Y_{2} + (V_{1} - V_{2})Y_{3} \tag{16.16.1}
$$

At node 2,

$$
(V_{1} - V_{2})Y_{3} = (V_{2} - 0)Y_{4} \tag{16.16.2}
$$

But  $V_{2} = V_{o}$ , so Eq. (16.16.1) becomes

$$
Y_{1}V_{s} = (Y_{1} + Y_{2} + Y_{3})V_{1} - (Y_{2} + Y_{3})V_{o} \tag{16.16.3}
$$

and Eq. (16.16.2) becomes

$$
V_{1}Y_{3} = (Y_{3} + Y_{4})V_{o}
$$

or

$$
V_{1} = \frac{1}{Y_{3}} (Y_{3} + Y_{4})V_{o} \tag{16.16.4}
$$

Substituting Eq. (16.16.4) into Eq. (16.16.3) gives

$$
Y_{1}V_{s} = (Y_{1} + Y_{2} + Y_{3})\frac{1}{Y_{3}} (Y_{3} + Y_{4})V_{o} - (Y_{2} + Y_{3})V_{o}
$$

or

$$
Y_{1}Y_{3}V_{s} = [Y_{1}Y_{3} + Y_{4}(Y_{1} + Y_{2} + Y_{3})]V_{o}
$$

Thus,

$$
\frac{V_{o}}{V_{s}} = \frac{Y_{1}Y_{3}}{Y_{1}Y_{3} + Y_{4}(Y_{1} + Y_{2} + Y_{3})} \tag{16.16.5}
$$

To synthesize the given transfer function  $T(s)$ , compare it with the one in Eq. (16.16.5). Notice two things: (1)  $Y_{1}Y_{3}$  must not involve  $s$  because the numerator of  $T(s)$  is constant; (2) the given transfer function is second- order, which implies that we must have two capacitors. Therefore, we must make  $Y_{1}$  and  $Y_{3}$  resistive, while  $Y_{2}$  and  $Y_{4}$  are capacitive. So we select

$$
Y_{1} = \frac{1}{R_{1}},\qquad Y_{2} = s C_{1},\qquad Y_{3} = \frac{1}{R_{2}},\qquad Y_{4} = s C_{2} \tag{16.16.6}
$$

Substituting Eq. (16.16.6) into Eq. (16.16.5) gives

$$
\begin{array}{r l} & {\frac{V_{o}}{V_{s}} = \frac{1 / (R_{1}R_{2})}{1 / (R_{1}R_{2}) + s C_{2}(1 / R_{1} + 1 / R_{2} + s C_{1})}}\\ & {\qquad = \frac{1 / (R_{1}R_{2}C_{1}C_{2})}{s^{2} + s(R_{1} + R_{2}) / (R_{1}R_{2}C_{1}) + 1 / (R_{1}R_{2}C_{1}C_{2})}} \end{array}
$$

Comparing this with the given transfer function  $T(s)$ , we notice that

$$
\frac{1}{R_{1}R_{2}C_{1}C_{2}} = 10^{6},\qquad \frac{R_{1} + R_{2}}{R_{1}R_{2}C_{1}} = 100
$$

If we select  $R_{1} = R_{2} = 10\mathrm{k}\Omega$ , then

$$
C_{1} = \frac{R_{1} + R_{2}}{100R_{1}R_{2}} = \frac{20\times 10^{3}}{100\times 100\times 10^{6}} = 2\mu \mathrm{F}
$$

$$
C_{2} = \frac{10^{-6}}{R_{1}R_{2}C_{1}} = \frac{10^{-6}}{100\times 10^{6}\times 2\times 10^{-6}} = 5\mathrm{nF}
$$

Thus, the given transfer function is realized using the circuit shown in Fig. 16.33.

# 16.7 Summary

1. The Laplace transform can be used to analyze a circuit. We convert each element from the time domain to the  $s$ -domain, solve the problem using any circuit analysis technique, and convert the result to the time domain using the inverse transform.

2. In the  $s$ -domain, the circuit elements are replaced with the initial condition at  $t = 0$  as follows. (Please note, voltage models are

given below, but the corresponding current models work equally well.):

$$
\begin{array}{l l l}{{\mathrm{Resistor:}}}&{{\nu_{R}=R i}}&{{\rightarrow}}&{{V_{R}=R I}}\\ {{\mathrm{Inductor:}}}&{{\nu_{L}=L\frac{d i}{d t}}}&{{\rightarrow}}&{{V_{L}=s L I-L i(0^{-})}}\\ {{}}&{{}}&{{}}&{{}}\\ {{\mathrm{Capacitor:}}}&{{\nu_{C}=\int i d t}}&{{\rightarrow}}&{{V_{C}=\frac{1}{s C}-\frac{\nu(0^{-})}{s}}}\\ {{}}&{{}}&{{}}&{{}}\end{array}
$$

3. Using the Laplace transform to analyze a circuit results in a complete (both transient and steady state) response because the initial conditions are incorporated in the transformation process.

4. The transfer function  $H(s)$  of a network is the Laplace transform of the impulse response  $h(t)$ .

5. In the  $s$ -domain, the transfer function  $H(s)$  relates the output response  $Y(s)$  and an input excitation  $X(s)$ ; that is,  $H(s) = Y(s) / X(s)$ .

6. The state variable model is a useful tool for analyzing complex systems with several inputs and outputs. State variable analysis is a powerful technique that is most popularly used in circuit theory and control. The state of a system is the smallest set of quantities (known as state variables) that we must know to determine its future response to any given input. The state equation in state variable form is

$$
\dot{\mathbf{x}} = \mathbf{A}x + \mathbf{B}z
$$

while the output equation is

$$
\mathbf{y} = \mathbf{C}x + \mathbf{D}z
$$

7. For an electric circuit, we first select capacitor voltages and inductor current as state variables. We then apply KCL and KVL to obtain the state equations.

8. Two other areas of applications of the Laplace transform covered in this chapter are circuit stability and synthesis. A circuit is stable when all the poles of its transfer function lie in the left half of the  $s$  plane. Network synthesis is the process of obtaining an appropriate network to represent a given transfer function for which analysis in the  $s$ -domain is well suited.

# Section 16.4 Transfer Functions

16.72 The transfer function of a system is

$$
H(s) = \frac{s^{2}}{3s + 1}
$$

Find the output when the system has an input of  $4e^{- t / 3}u(t)$ .

16.73 When the input to a system is a unit step function, the response is  $10\cos 2tu(t)$ . Obtain the transfer function of the system.

16.74 Design a problem to help other students better understand how to find outputs when given a transfer function and an input.

16.75 When a unit step is applied to a system at  $t = 0$ , its response is

$$
y(t) = [4 + 0.5e^{-3t} - e^{-2t}(2\cos 4t + 3\sin 4t)]u(t)
$$

# Enhancing Your Skills and Your Career

# ABET EC 2ooo criteria (3.j), "a knowledge of contemporary issues."

Engineers must have knowledge of contemporary issues. To have a truly meaningful career in the twenty- first century, you must have knowledge of contemporary issues, especially those that may directly affect your job and/or work. One of the easiest ways to achieve this is to read a lot- - newspapers, magazines, and contemporary books. As a student enrolled in an ABET- accredited program, some of the courses you take will be directed toward meeting this criteria.

# ABET EC 2ooo criteria (3.k), "an ability to use the techniques, skills, and modern engineering tools necessary for engineering practice."

The successful engineer must have the "ability to use the techniques, skills, and modern engineering tools necessary for engineering practice." Clearly, a major focus of this textbook is to do just that. Learning to use skillfully the tools that facilitate your working in a modern "knowledge capturing integrated design environment" (KCIDE) is fundamental to your performance as an engineer. The ability to work in a modern KCIDE environment requires a thorough understanding of the tools associated with that environment.

The successful engineer, therefore, must keep abreast of the new design, analysis, and simulation tools. That engineer must also use those tools until he or she is comfortable with using them. The engineer also must make sure software results are consistent with real- world actualities. It is probably in this area that most engineers have the greatest difficulty. Thus, successful use of these tools requires constant learning and relearning the fundamentals of the area in which the engineer is working.

Jean Baptiste Joseph Fourier (1768- 1830), a French mathematician, first presented the series and transform that bear his name. Fourier's results were not enthusiastically received by the scientific world. He could not even get his work published as a paper.

Born in Auxerre, France, Fourier was orphaned at age 8. He attended a local military college run by Benedictine monks, where he demonstrated great proficiency in mathematics. Like most of his contemporaries, Fourier was swept into the politics of the French Revolution. He played an important role in Napoleon's expeditions to Egypt in the later 1790s. Due to his political involvement, he narrowly escaped death twice.

# 17.1 Introduction

We have spent a considerable amount of time on the analysis of circuits with sinusoidal sources. This chapter is concerned with a means of analyz. ing circuits with periodic, nonsinusoidal excitations. The notion of periodic functions was introduced in Chapter 9; it was mentioned there that the sinusoid is the most simple and useful periodic function. This chapter introduces the Fourier series, a technique for expressing a periodic function in terms of sinusoids. Once the source function is expressed in terms of sinusoids, we can apply the phasor method to analyze circuits.

The Fourier series is named after Jean Baptiste Joseph Fourier (1768- 1830). In 1822, Fourier's genius came up with the insight that any practical periodic function can be represented as a sum of sinusoids. Such a representation, along with the superposition theorem, allows us to find the response of circuits to arbitrary periodic inputs using phasor techniques.

We begin with the trigonometric Fourier series. Later we consider the exponential Fourier series. We then apply Fourier series in circuit analysis. Finally, practical applications of Fourier series in spectrum analyzers and filters are demonstrated.

# 17.2 Trigonometric Fourier Series

While studying heat flow, Fourier discovered that a nonsinusoidal periodic function can be expressed as an infinite sum of sinusoidal functions. Recall that a periodic function is one that repeats every  $T$  seconds. In other words, a periodic function  $f(t)$  satisfies

$$
f(t) = f(t + nT) \tag{17.1}
$$

where  $n$  is an integer and  $T$  is the period of the function.

According to the Fourier theorem, any practical periodic function of angular frequency  $\omega_0$  can be expressed as an infinite sum of sine or cosine functions that are integral multiples of  $\omega_0$ . Thus,  $f(t)$  can be expressed as

$$
\begin{array}{r l} & {f(t) = a_{0} + a_{1}\cos \omega_{0}t + b_{1}\sin \omega_{0}t + a_{2}\cos 2\omega_{0}t}\\ & {\qquad +b_{2}\sin 2\omega_{0}t + a_{3}\cos 3\omega_{0}t + b_{3}\sin 3\omega_{0}t + \dots} \end{array} \tag{17.2}
$$

or

$$
\boxed{f(t) = \frac{a_{0}}{\mathrm{dc}} + \sum_{n = 1}^{\infty} \frac{(a_{n} \cos n \omega_{0} t + b_{n} \sin n \omega_{0} t)}{\mathrm{ac}}} \tag{17.3}
$$

where  $\omega_{0} = 2\pi /T$  is called the fundamental angular frequency in radians per second. The sinusoid sin  $n\omega_{0}t$  or cos  $n\omega_{0}t$  is called the nth harmonic of  $f(t)$  ; it is an odd harmonic if  $n$  is odd and an even harmonic if  $n$  is even. Equation 17.3 is called the trigonometric Fourier series of  $f(t)$  . The constants  $a_{n}$  and  $b_{n}$  are the Fourier coefficients. The coefficient  $a_{0}$  is the dc component or the average value of  $f(t)$  .(Recall that sinusoids have zero average values.) The coefficients  $a_{n}$  and  $b_{n}$  (for  $n\neq 0$  ) are the amplitudes of the sinusoids in the ac component. Thus,

The Fourier series of a periodic function  $f(t)$  is a representation that resolves  $f(t)$  into a dc component and an ac component comprising an infinite series of harmonic sinusoids.

A function that can be represented by a Fourier series as in Eq. (17.3) must meet certain requirements, because the infinite series in Eq. (17.3) may or may not converge. These conditions on  $f(t)$  to yield a convergent Fourier series are as follows:

1.  $f(t)$  is single-valued everywhere.

2.  $f(t)$  has a finite number of finite discontinuities in any one period.

3.  $f(t)$  has a finite number of maxima and minima in any one period.

4. The integral  $\left| f(t) \right| dt < \infty$  for any  $t_0$ .

The harmonic angular frequency  $\omega_n$  is an integer multiple of the fundamental angular frequency  $\omega_0$ , i.e.,  $\omega_n = n \omega_0$ .

Historical note: Although Fourier published his theorem in 1822, it was P. G. L. Dirichlet (1805- 1859) who later supplied an acceptable proof of the theorem.

A software package like Mathcad or Maple can be used to evaluate the Fourier coefficients.

These conditions are called Dirichlet conditions. Although they are not necessary conditions, they are sufficient conditions for a Fourier series to exist.

A major task in Fourier series is the determination of the Fourier coefficients  $a_0$ ,  $a_n$ , and  $b_n$ . The process of determining the coefficients is called Fourier analysis. The following trigonometric integrals are very helpful in Fourier analysis. For any integers  $m$  and  $n$ ,

$$
\int_{0}^{T} \sin n \omega_0 t dt = 0 \tag{17.4a}
$$

$$
\int_{0}^{T} \cos n \omega_0 t dt = 0 \tag{17.4b}
$$

$$
\int_{0}^{T} \sin n \omega_0 t \cos m \omega_0 t dt = 0 \tag{17.4c}
$$

$$
\int_{0}^{T} \sin n \omega_0 t \sin m \omega_0 t dt = 0, \qquad (m \neq n) \tag{17.4d}
$$

$$
\int_{0}^{T} \cos n \omega_0 t \cos m \omega_0 t dt = 0, \qquad (m \neq n) \tag{17.4e}
$$

$$
\int_{0}^{T} \sin^2 n \omega_0 t dt = \frac{T}{2} \tag{17.4f}
$$

$$
\int_{0}^{T} \cos^2 n \omega_0 t dt = \frac{T}{2} \tag{17.4g}
$$

Let us use these identities to evaluate the Fourier coefficients.

We begin by finding  $a_0$ . We integrate both sides of Eq. (17.3) over one period and obtain

$$
\begin{array}{r l r}{{\int_{0}^{T}f(t) d t=\int_{0}^{T}\left[a_{0}+\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}(a_{n}\cos n\omega_{0}t+b_{n}\sin n\omega_{0}t)\right]d t}}\\ &{}&{=\int_{0}^{T}a_{0} d t+\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\left[\int_{0}^{T}a_{n}\cos n\omega_{0}t d t+\int_{0}^{T}b_{n}\sin n\omega_{0}t d t\right]d t}\end{array} \tag{17.5}
$$

Invoking the identities of Eqs. (17.4a) and (17.4b), the two integrals involving the ac terms vanish. Hence,

$$
\int_{0}^{T} f(t) dt = \int_{0}^{T} a_0 dt = a_0 T
$$

or

$$
a_0 = \frac{1}{T} \int_{0}^{T} f(t) dt \tag{17.6}
$$

showing that  $a_0$  is the average value of  $f(t)$ .

To evaluate  $a_{n}$ , we multiply both sides of Eq. (17.3) by  $\cos m\omega_{0}t$  and integrate over one period:

$$
\begin{array}{rl} & {\int_{0}^{T}f(t)\cos m\omega_{0}t dt}\\ & {= \int_{0}^{T}\left[a_{0} + \sum_{n = 1}^{\infty}(a_{n}\cos n\omega_{0}t + b_{n}\sin n\omega_{0}t)\right]\cos m\omega_{0}t dt}\\ & {= \int_{0}^{T}a_{0}\cos m\omega_{0}t dt + \sum_{n = 1}^{\infty}\left[\int_{0}^{T}a_{n}\cos n\omega_{0}t\cos m\omega_{0}t dt\right.}\\ & {\left. + \int_{0}^{T}b_{n}\sin n\omega_{0}t\cos m\omega_{0}t dt\right]dt} \end{array} \tag{17.7}
$$

The integral containing  $a_{0}$  is zero in view of Eq. (17.4b), while the integral containing  $b_{n}$  vanishes according to Eq. (17.4c). The integral containing  $a_{n}$  will be zero except when  $m = n$ , in which case it is  $T / 2$ , according to Eqs. (17.4e) and (17.4g). Thus,

$$
\int_{0}^{T}f(t)\cos m\omega_{0}t dt = a_{n}\frac{T}{2},\qquad \mathrm{for} m = n
$$

or

$$
a_{n} = \frac{2}{T}\int_{0}^{T}f(t)\cos n\omega_{0}t dt \tag{17.8}
$$

In a similar vein, we obtain  $b_{n}$  by multiplying both sides of Eq. (17.3) by  $\sin m\omega_{0}t$  and integrating over the period. The result is

$$
b_{n} = \frac{2}{T}\int_{0}^{T}f(t)\sin n\omega_{0}t dt \tag{17.9}
$$

Be aware that because  $f(t)$  is periodic, it may be more convenient to carry the integrations above from  $- T / 2$  to  $T / 2$  or generally from  $t_{0}$  to  $t_{0} + T$  instead of 0 to  $T$ . The result will be the same.

An alternative form of Eq. (17.3) is the amplitude- phase form

$$
\boxed{f(t) = a_{0} + \sum_{n = 1}^{\infty}A_{n}\cos (n\omega_{0}t + \phi_{n})} \tag{17.10}
$$

We can use Eqs. (9.11) and (9.12) to relate Eq. (17.3) to Eq. (17.10), or we can apply the trigonometric identity

$$
\cos (\alpha +\beta) = \cos \alpha \cos \beta -\sin \alpha \sin \beta \tag{17.11}
$$

to the ac terms in Eq. (17.10) so that

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{a_{0}+\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}A_{n}\cos\left(n\omega_{0}t+\phi_{n}\right)=a_{0}+\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\left(A_{n}\cos\phi_{n}\right)\cos n\omega_{0}t}}\\ {{-(A_{n}\sin\phi_{n})\sin n\omega_{0}t}}\end{array} \tag{17.12}
$$

Equating the coefficients of the series expansions in Eqs. (17.3) and (17.12) shows that

$$
a_{n} = A_{n}\cos \phi_{n},\qquad b_{n} = -A_{n}\sin \phi_{n} \tag{17.13a}
$$

or

$$
A_{n} = \sqrt{a_{n}^{2} + b_{n}^{2}},\qquad \phi_{n} = -\tan^{-1}\frac{b_{n}}{a_{n}} \tag{17.13b}
$$

To avoid any confusion in determining  $\phi_{n}$ , it may be better to relate the terms in complex form as

$$
A_{n} / \phi_{n} = a_{n} - j b_{n} \tag{17.14}
$$

The convenience of this relationship will become evident in Section 17.6. The plot of the amplitude  $A_{n}$  of the harmonics versus  $n\omega_{0}$  is called the amplitude spectrum of  $f(t)$ ; the plot of the phase  $\phi_{n}$  versus  $n\omega_{0}$  is the phase spectrum of  $f(t)$ . Both the amplitude and phase spectra form the frequency spectrum of  $f(t)$ .

The frequency spectrum of a signal consists of the plots of the amplitudes and phases of the harmonics versus frequency.

Thus, the Fourier analysis is also a mathematical tool for finding the spectrum of a periodic signal. Section 17.6 will elaborate more on the spectrum of a signal.

To evaluate the Fourier coefficients  $a_{0}, a_{n}$ , and  $b_{n}$ , we often need to apply the following integrals:

$$
\int \cos a t d t = \frac{1}{a} \sin a t \tag{17.15a}
$$

$$
\int \sin a t d t = -\frac{1}{a} \cos a t \tag{17.15b}
$$

$$
\int t \cos a t d t = \frac{1}{a^{2}} \cos a t + \frac{1}{a} t \sin a t \tag{17.15c}
$$

$$
\int t \sin a t d t = \frac{1}{a^{2}} \sin a t - \frac{1}{a} t \cos a t \tag{17.15d}
$$

It is also useful to know the values of the cosine, sine, and exponential functions for integral multiples of  $\pi$ . These are given in Table 17.1, where  $n$  is an integer.

Figure 17.1 For Example 17.1; a square wave.

Determine the Fourier series of the waveform shown in Fig. 17.1. Obtain the amplitude and phase spectra.

# Solution:

The Fourier series is given by Eq. (17.3), namely,

$$
f(t) = a_{0} + \sum_{n = 1}^{\infty} (a_{n} \cos n\omega_{0} t + b_{n} \sin n\omega_{0} t) \tag{17.1.1}
$$

Our goal is to obtain the Fourier coefficients  $a_{0}, a_{n}$ , and  $b_{n}$  using Eqs. (17.6), (17.8), and (17.9). First, we describe the waveform as

$$
f(t) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}1, & 0 < t < 1 \\ 0, & 1 < t < 2 \end{array} \right. \tag{17.1.2}
$$

and  $f(t) = f(t + T)$ . Because  $T = 2$ ,  $\omega_{0} = 2\pi /T = \pi$ . Thus,

$$
a_{0} = \frac{1}{T}\int_{0}^{T}f(t)dt = \frac{1}{2}\left[\int_{0}^{1}1dt + \int_{1}^{2}0dt\right] = \frac{1}{2} t\left|_{0}^{1} = \frac{1}{2}\right. \tag{17.1.3}
$$

Using Eq. (17.8) along with Eq. (17.15a),

$$
\begin{array}{l}{{a_{n}=\frac{2}{T}\int_{0}^{T}f(t)\cos n\omega_{0}t d t}}\\ {{\quad=\frac{2}{2}\int_{0}^{1}1\cos n\pi t d t+\int_{1}^{2}0\cos n\pi t d t}}\\ {{\quad=\frac{1}{n\pi}\sin n\pi t|_{0}^{1}=\frac{1}{n\pi}[\sin n\pi-\sin(0)]=0}}\end{array} \tag{17.1.4}
$$

From Eq. (17.9) with the aid of Eq. (17.15b),

$$
\begin{array}{l}{{b_{n}=\frac{2}{T}\int_{0}^{T}f(t)\sin n\omega_{0}t d t}}\\ {{\quad=\frac{2}{2}[\int_{0}^{1}1\sin n\pi t d t+\int_{1}^{2}0\sin n\pi t d t]}}\\ {{\quad=-\frac{1}{n\pi}\cos n\pi t|_{0}^{1}}}\\ {{\quad=-\frac{1}{n\pi}(\cos n\pi-1),\qquad\cos n\pi=(-1)^{n}}}\\ {{\quad=\frac{1}{n\pi}[1-(-1)^{n}]={\frac{2}{n\pi},\quad n=\mathrm{odd}}}\\ {{\quad\left.0,\qquad n=\mathrm{even}}}\end{array} \tag{17.1.5}
$$

Substituting the Fourier coefficients in Eqs. (17.1.3) to (17.1.5) into Eq. (17.1.1) gives the Fourier series as

$$
f(t) = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{2}{\pi} \sin \pi t + \frac{2}{3\pi} \sin 3\pi t + \frac{2}{5\pi} \sin 5\pi t + \dots \tag{17.1.6}
$$

Given that  $f(t)$  contains only the dc component and the sine terms with the fundamental component and odd harmonics, it may be written as

$$
f(t) = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{2}{\pi} \sum_{k = 1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n} \sin n\pi t, \qquad n = 2k - 1 \tag{17.1.7}
$$

By summing the terms one by one as demonstrated in Fig. 17.2, we notice how superposition of the terms can evolve into the original square. As more and more Fourier components are added, the sum gets closer and closer to the square wave. However, it is not possible in practice to sum the series in Eq. (17.1.6) or (17.1.7) to infinity. Only a partial sum  $(n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots , N$ , where  $N$  is finite) is possible. If we plot the partial sum (or truncated series) over one period for a large  $N$  as

Figure 17.3 Truncating the Fourier series at  $N = 11$ ; Gibbs phenomenon.

in Fig. 17.3, we notice that the partial sum oscillates above and below the actual value of  $f(t)$ . At the neighborhood of the points of discontinuity  $(x = 0, 1, 2, \ldots)$ , there is overshoot and damped oscillation. In fact, an overshoot of about 9 percent of the peak value is always present, regardless of the number of terms used to approximate  $f(t)$ . This is called the Gibbs phenomenon.

Finally, let us obtain the amplitude and phase spectra for the signal in Fig. 17.1. Since  $a_{n} = 0$

$$
A_{n} = \sqrt{a_{n}^{2} + b_{n}^{2}} = |b_{n}| = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}\frac{2}{n\pi}, & n = \mathrm{odd}\\ 0, & n = \mathrm{even} \end{array} \right. \tag{17.1.8}
$$

and

$$
\phi_{n} = -\tan^{-1}\frac{b_{n}}{a_{n}} = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} - 90^{\circ}, & n = \mathrm{odd}\\ 0, & n = \mathrm{even} \end{array} \right. \tag{17.1.9}
$$

The plots of  $A_{n}$  and  $\phi_{n}$  for different values of  $n\omega_{0} = n\pi$  provide the amplitude and phase spectra in Fig. 17.4. Notice that the amplitudes of the harmonics decay very fast with frequency.

Figure 17.6 For Practice Prob. 17.1: amplitude and phase spectra for the function shown in Fig. 17.5.

Obtain the Fourier series for the periodic function in Fig. 17.7 and plot the amplitude and phase spectra.

# Solution:

The function is described as

$$
f(t) = {\left\{ \begin{array}{l l}{t,} & {0< t< 1}\\ {0,} & {1< t< 2} \end{array} \right.}
$$

Because  $T = 2$ $\omega_{0} = 2\pi /T = \pi$  . Then

$$
a_{0} = \frac{1}{T}\int_{0}^{T}f(t) d t = \frac{1}{2}\left[\int_{0}^{1}t d t + \int_{1}^{2}0 d t\right] = \frac{1}{2}\frac{t^{2}}{2}\left|_{0}^{1} = \frac{1}{4}\right. \tag{17.2.1}
$$

To evaluate  $a_{n}$  and  $b_{n}$  , we need the integrals in Eq. (17.15):

$$
\begin{array}{l}{{a_{n}=\frac{2}{T}\int_{0}^{T}f(t)\cos n\omega_{0}t d t}}\\ {{\mathrm{}}}\\ {{\mathrm{}=\frac{2}{2}\left[\int_{0}^{1}t\cos n\pi t d t+\int_{1}^{2}0\cos n\pi t d t\right]}}\\ {{\mathrm{}=\left[\frac{1}{n^{2}\pi^{2}}\cos n\pi t+\frac{t}{n\pi}\sin n\pi t\right]\left|_{0}^{1}\right.}}\\ {{\mathrm{}=\frac{1}{n^{2}\pi^{2}}(\cos n\pi-1)+0=\frac{(-1)^{n}-1}{n^{2}\pi^{2}}}}\end{array} \tag{17.2.2}
$$

since cos  $n\pi = (- 1)^{n}$  ; and

$$
\begin{array}{l}{{b_{n}=\frac{2}{T}\int_{0}^{T}f(t)\sin n\omega_{0}t d t}}\\ {{\mathrm{}}}\\ {{\mathrm{}=\frac{2}{2}\left[\int_{0}^{1}t\sin n\pi t d t+\int_{1}^{2}0\sin n\pi t d t\right]}}\\ {{\mathrm{}=\left[\frac{1}{n^{2}\pi^{2}}\sin n\pi t-\frac{t}{n\pi}\cos n\pi t\right]\left|_{0}^{1}\right.}}\\ {{\mathrm{}=\left.0-\frac{\cos n\pi}{n\pi}=\frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{n\pi}\right.}}\end{array} \tag{17.2.3}
$$

Substituting the Fourier coefficients just found into Eq. (17.3) yields

$$
f(t) = \frac{1}{4} +\sum_{n = 1}^{\infty}\left[\frac{(-1)^{n} - 1]}{(n\pi)^{2}}\cos n\pi t + \frac{(-1)^{n + 1}}{n\pi}\sin n\pi t\right]
$$

To obtain the amplitude and phase spectra, we notice that, for even harmonics,  $a_{n} = 0$  ,  $b_{n} = - 1 / n\pi$  , so that

$$
A_{n} / \phi_{n} = a_{n} - j b_{n} = 0 + j\frac{1}{n\pi} \tag{17.2.4}
$$

Hence,

$$
\begin{array}{l}{{A_{n}=| b_{n}|=\frac{1}{n\pi},\qquad n=2,4,\ldots}}\\ {{\phi_{n}=90^{\circ},\qquad n=2,4,\ldots}}\end{array} \tag{17.2.5}

Figure 17.8 For Example 17.2: (a) amplitude spectrum, (b) phase spectrum.

For odd harmonics,  $a_{n} = - 2 / (n^{2}\pi^{2}), b_{n} = 1 / (n\pi)$  so that

$$
A_{n} / \phi_{n} = a_{n} - j b_{n} = -\frac{2}{n^{2}\pi^{2}} -j \frac{1}{n\pi} \tag{17.2.6}
$$

That is,

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{A_{n}=\sqrt{a_{n}^{2}+b_{n}^{2}}=\sqrt{\frac{4}{n^{4}\pi^{4}}+\frac{1}{n^{2}\pi^{2}}}}}\\ {{=\frac{1}{n^{2}\pi^{2}}\sqrt{4+n^{2}\pi^{2}},\qquad n=1,3,\ldots}}\end{array} \tag{17.2.7}
$$

From Eq. (17.2.6), we observe that  $\phi$  lies in the third quadrant, so that

$$
\phi_{n} = 180^{\circ} + \tan^{-1} \frac{n\pi}{2}, \qquad n = 1, 3, \ldots \tag{17.2.8}
$$

From Eqs. (17.2.5), (17.2.7), and (17.2.8), we plot  $A_{n}$  and  $\phi_{n}$  for different values of  $n\omega_{0} = n\pi$  to obtain the amplitude spectrum and phase spectrum as shown in Fig. 17.8.

Answer:  $f(t) = 3 - \frac{6}{\pi} \sum_{n = 1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n} \sin 2\pi nt.$

# 17.3 Symmetry Considerations

We noticed that the Fourier series of Example 17.1 consisted only of the sine terms. One may wonder if a method exists whereby one can know in advance that some Fourier coefficients would be zero and avoid the unnecessary work involved in the tedious process of calculating them. Such a method does exist; it is based on recognizing the existence of symmetry. Here we discuss three types of symmetry: (1) even symmetry, (2) odd symmetry, (3) half- wave symmetry.

# 17.3.1 Even Symmetry

A function  $f(t)$  is even if its plot is symmetrical about the vertical axis; that is,

$$
f(t) = f(-t) \tag{17.16}
$$

Examples of even functions are  $t^{2}, t^{4}$ , and  $\cos t$ . Figure 17.10 shows more examples of periodic even functions. Note that each of these examples satisfies Eq. (17.16). A main property of an even function  $f e(t)$  is that:

$$
\int_{-T / 2}^{T / 2} f_{e}(t) dt = 2 \int_{0}^{T / 2} f_{e}(t) dt \tag{17.17}
$$

because integrating from  $- T / 2$  to 0 is the same as integrating from 0 to  $T / 2$ . Utilizing this property, the Fourier coefficients for an even function become

$$
\begin{array}{l}{{a_{0}=\frac{2}{T}\int_{0}^{T/2}f(t)d t}}\\ {{a_{n}=\frac{4}{T}\int_{0}^{T/2}f(t)\cos n\omega_{0}t d t}}\\ {{b_{n}=0}}\end{array} \tag{17.18}
$$

Because  $b_{n} = 0$ , Eq. (17.3) becomes a Fourier cosine series. This makes sense because the cosine function is itself even. It also makes intuitive sense that an even function contains no sine terms given that the sine function is odd.

To confirm Eq. (17.18) quantitatively, we apply the property of an even function in Eq. (17.17) in evaluating the Fourier coefficients in Eqs. (17.6), (17.8), and (17.9). It is convenient in each case to integrate over the interval  $- T / 2 < t < T / 2$ , which is symmetrical about the origin. Thus,

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-14/63c420e9-9220-47ad-935a-09e6b2aeb2a8/442a46a7832434358c6c9854d24d4bb0b37b78e24dccb47886f8955a1913ee57.jpg)  
Figure 17.10 Typical examples of even periodic functions.

$$
a_{0} = \frac{1}{T} \int_{-T / 2}^{T / 2} f(t) dt = \frac{1}{T} \left[ \int_{-T / 2}^{0} f(t) dt + \int_{0}^{T / 2} f(t) dt \right] \tag{17.19}
$$

We change variables for the integral over the interval  $- T / 2 < t < 0$  by letting  $t = - x$ , so that  $dt = - dx$ ,  $f(t) = f(- t) = f(x)$ , since  $f(t)$  is an even function, and when  $t = - T / 2$ ,  $x = T / 2$ . Then,

$$
\begin{array}{l}{{a_{0}=\frac{1}{T}\left[\int_{T/2}^{0}f(x)(-d x)+\int_{0}^{T/2}f(t) d t\right]}}\\ {{\mathrm{}}}\\ {{\mathrm{}=\frac{1}{T}\left[\int_{0}^{T/2}f(x) d x+\int_{0}^{T/2}f(t) d t\right]}}\end{array} \tag{17.20}
$$

showing that the two integrals are identical. Hence,

$$
a_{0} = \frac{2}{T} \int_{0}^{T / 2} f(t) dt \tag{17.21}
$$

as expected. Similarly, from Eq. (17.8),

$$
a_{n} = \frac{2}{T} \left[ \int_{-T / 2}^{0} f(t) \cos n \omega_{0} t dt + \int_{0}^{T / 2} f(t) \cos n \omega_{0} t dt \right] \tag{17.22}
$$

We make the same change of variables that led to Eq. (17.20) and note that both  $f(t)$  and cos  $n\omega_{0}t$  are even functions, implying that  $f(- t) = f(t)$  and  $\cos (- n\omega_{0}t) = \cos n\omega_{0}t$ . Equation (17.22) becomes

$$
\begin{array}{l}{{a_{n}=\frac{2}{T}\left[\int_{T/2}^{0}f(-x)\cos(-n\omega_{0}x)(-d x)+\int_{0}^{T/2}f(t)\cos n\omega_{0}t d t\right]}}\\ {{\quad=\frac{2}{T}\left[\int_{T/2}^{0}f(x)\cos(n\omega_{0}x)(-d x)+\int_{0}^{T/2}f(t)\cos n\omega_{0}t d t\right]}}\\ {{\quad=\frac{2}{T}\left[\int_{0}^{T/2}f(x)\cos(n\omega_{0}x)d x+\int_{0}^{T/2}f(t)\cos n\omega_{0}t d t\right]}}\end{array} \tag{17.23a}
$$

or

$$
a_{n} = \frac{4}{T}\int_{0}^{T / 2}f(t)\cos n\omega_{0}t d t \tag{17.23b}
$$

as expected. For  $b_{n}$ , we apply Eq. (17.9),

$$
b_{n} = \frac{2}{T}\left[\int_{-T / 2}^{0}f(t)\sin n\omega_{0}t d t + \int_{0}^{T / 2}f(t)\sin n\omega_{0}t d t\right] \tag{17.24}
$$

We make the same change of variables but keep in mind that  $f(- t) = f(t)$  but  $\sin (- n\omega_{0}t) = - \sin n\omega_{0}t$ . Equation (17.24) yields

$$
\begin{array}{l}{{b_{n}=\frac{2}{T}\left[\int_{T/2}^{0}f(-x)\sin(-n\omega_{0}x)(-d x)+\int_{0}^{T/2}f(t)\sin n\omega_{0}t d t\right]}}\\ {{\quad=\frac{2}{T}\left[\int_{T/2}^{0}f(x)\sin n\omega_{0}x d x+\int_{0}^{T/2}f(t)\sin n\omega_{0}t d t\right]}}\\ {{\quad=\frac{2}{T}\left[-\int_{0}^{T/2}f(x)\sin(n\omega_{0}x)d x+\int_{0}^{T/2}f(t)\sin n\omega_{0}t d t\right]}}\\ {{\quad=0}}\end{array} \tag{17.25}
$$

confirming Eq. (17.18).

# 17.3.2 Odd Symmetry

A function  $f(t)$  is said to be odd if its plot is antisymmetrical about the vertical axis:

$$
f(-t) = -f(t) \tag{17.26}
$$

Examples of odd functions are  $t, t^{3}$ , and  $\sin t$ . Figure 17.11 shows more examples of periodic odd functions. All these examples satisfy Eq. (17.26). An odd function  $f_{o}(t)$  has this major characteristic:

$$
\int_{-T / 2}^{T / 2}f_{o}(t) d t = 0 \tag{17.27}
$$

because integration from  $- T / 2$  to 0 is the negative of that from 0 to  $T / 2$ . With this property, the Fourier coefficients for an odd function become

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{a_{0}=0,\qquad a_{n}=0}}\\ {{b_{n}=\frac{4}{T}\int_{0}^{T/2}f(t)\sin n\omega_{0}t d t}}\end{array} \tag{17.28}
$$

which give us a Fourier sine series. Again, this makes sense because the sine function is itself an odd function. Also, note that there is no dc term for the Fourier series expansion of an odd function.

The quantitative proof of Eq. (17.28) follows the same procedure taken to prove Eq. (17.18) except that  $f(t)$  is now odd, so that  $f(t) = - f(t)$ . With this fundamental but simple difference, it is easy to see that  $a_{0} = 0$  in Eq. (17.20),  $a_{n} = 0$  in Eq. (17.23a), and  $b_{n}$  in Eq. (17.24) becomes

$$
\begin{array}{l}{{b_{n}=\frac{2}{T}\left[\int_{T/2}^{0}f(-x)\sin(-n\omega_{0}x)(-d x)+\int_{0}^{T/2}f(t)\sin n\omega_{0}t d t\right]}}\\ {{\mathrm{}}}\\ {{\mathrm{}=\frac{2}{T}\left[-\int_{T/2}^{0}f(x)\sin n\omega_{0}x d x+\int_{0}^{T/2}f(t)\sin n\omega_{0}t d t\right]}}\\ {{\mathrm{}=\frac{2}{T}\left[\int_{0}^{T/2}f(x)\sin(n\omega_{0}x) d x+\int_{0}^{T/2}f(t)\sin n\omega_{0}t d t\right]}}\end{array}
$$

$$
b_{n} = \frac{4}{T}\int_{0}^{T / 2}f(t)\sin n\omega_{0}t d t \tag{17.29}
$$

as expected.

It is interesting to note that any periodic function  $f(t)$  with neither even nor odd symmetry may be decomposed into even and odd parts. Using the properties of even and odd functions from Eqs. (17.16) and (17.26), we can write

$$
f(t) = \underbrace{\frac{1}{2}\left[f(t) + f(-t)\right]}_{\mathrm{even}} + \underbrace{\frac{1}{2}\left[f(t) - f(-t)\right]}_{\mathrm{odd}} = f_{e}(t) + f_{o}(t) \tag{17.30}
$$

Notice that  $f_{e}(t) = \frac{1}{2} [f(t) + f(- t)]$  satisfies the property of an even function in Eq. (17.16), while  $f_{o}(t) = \frac{1}{2} [f(t) - f(- t)]$  satisfies the property of an odd function in Eq. (17.26). The fact that  $f_{e}(t)$  contains only the dc term and the cosine terms, while  $f_{o}(t)$  has only the sine terms, can be exploited in grouping the Fourier series expansion of  $f(t)$  as

$$
f(t) = \underbrace{a_{0} + \sum_{n = 1}^{\infty}a_{n}\cos n\omega_{0}t}_{\mathrm{even}} + \underbrace{\sum_{n = 1}^{\infty}b_{n}\sin n\omega_{0}t}_{\mathrm{odd}} = f_{e}(t) + f_{o}(t) \tag{17.31}
$$

It follows readily from Eq. (17.31) that when  $f(t)$  is even,  $b_{n} = 0$ , and when  $f(t)$  is odd,  $a_{0} = 0 = a_{n}$ .

Also, note the following properties of odd and even functions:

1. The product of two even functions is also an even function.

2. The product of two odd functions is an even function.

3. The product of an even function and an odd function is an odd function.

4. The sum (or difference) of two even functions is also an even function.

5. The sum (or difference) of two odd functions is an odd function.

6. The sum (or difference) of an even function and an odd function is neither even nor odd.

Each of these properties can be proved using Eqs. (17.16) and (17.26).

# 17.3.3 Half-Wave Symmetry

A function is half- wave (odd) symmetric if

$$
f\left(t - \frac{T}{2}\right) = -f(t) \tag{17.32}
$$

which means that each half- cycle is the mirror image of the next half- cycle. Notice that functions  $\cos n\omega_{0}t$  and  $\sin n\omega_{0}t$  satisfy Eq. (17.32) for odd values of  $n$  and therefore possess half- wave symmetry when  $n$  is odd. Figure 17.12 shows other examples of half- wave symmetric functions. The functions in Figs. 17.11(a) and 17.11(b) are also half- wave symmetric. Notice that for each function, one half- cycle is the inverted version of the adjacent half- cycle. The Fourier coefficients become

$$
\begin{array}{l}{{a_{0}=0}}\\ {{a_{n}=\left\{\frac{4}{T}\int_{0}^{T/2}f(t)\cos n\omega_{0}t d t,\quad\mathrm{for}n\mathrm{~odd}\right.}}\\ {{\left.\begin{array}{l}{{0,}}\\ {{0,}}\end{array}\right.}}\\ {{b_{n}=\left\{\frac{4}{T}\int_{0}^{T/2}f(t)\sin n\omega_{0}t d t,\quad\mathrm{for}n\mathrm{~odd}\right.}}\\ {{\left.\begin{array}{l}{{0,}}\end{array}\right.}}\end{array} \tag{17.33}
$$

Figure 17.12 Typical examples of half-wave odd symmetric functions.

showing that the Fourier series of a half- wave symmetric function contains only odd harmonics.

To derive Eq. (17.33), we apply the property of half- wave symmetric functions in Eq. (17.32) in evaluating the Fourier coefficients in Eqs. (17.6), (17.8), and (17.9). Thus,

$$
a_{0} = \frac{1}{T}\int_{-T / 2}^{T / 2}f(t) d t = \frac{1}{T}\left[\int_{-T / 2}^{0}f(t) d t + \int_{0}^{T / 2}f(t) d t\right] \tag{17.34}
$$

We change variables for the integral over the interval  $- T / 2< t< 0$  by letting  $x = t + T / 2$  , so that  $d t = d t$  ; when  $t = - T / 2$  ,  $x = 0$  ; and when  $t = 0$  ,  $x = T / 2$  . Also, we keep Eq. (17.32) in mind; that is,  $f(x - T / 2) = - f(x)$  . Then,

$$
\begin{array}{l}{{a_{0}=\frac{1}{T}\left[\int_{0}^{T/2}f\Big(x-\frac{T}{2}\Big) d x+\int_{0}^{T/2}f(t) d t\right]}}\\ {{\quad=\frac{1}{T}\left[-\int_{0}^{T/2}f(x) d x+\int_{0}^{T/2}f(t) d t\right]=0}}\end{array} \tag{17.35}
$$

confirming the expression for  $a_{0}$  in Eq. (17.33). Similarly,

$$
a_{n} = \frac{2}{T}\left[\int_{-T / 2}^{0}f(t) \cos n\omega_{0}t d t + \int_{0}^{T / 2}f(t) \cos n\omega_{0}t d t\right] \tag{17.36}
$$

We make the same change of variables that led to Eq. (17.35) so that Eq. (17.36) becomes

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{a_{n}=\frac{2}{T}\left[\int_{0}^{T/2}f\Big(x-\frac{T}{2}\Big) \cos n\omega_{0}\Big(x-\frac{T}{2}\Big) d x\right.}}\\ {{\left.\qquad+\int_{0}^{T/2}f(t) \cos n\omega_{0}t d t\right]}}\end{array} \tag{17.37}
$$

Because  $f(x - T / 2) = - f(x)$  and

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{\cos n\omega_{0}\Big(x-\frac{T}{2}\Big)=\cos(n\omega_{0}t-n\pi)}}\\ {{=\cos n\omega_{0}t \cos n\pi+\sin n\omega_{0}t \sin n\pi}}\\ {{=(-1)^{n} \cos n\omega_{0}t}}\end{array} \tag{17.38}
$$

substituting these in Eq. (17.37) leads to

$$
\begin{array}{l}{{a_{n}=\frac{2}{T}\left[1-(-1)^{n}\right]\int_{0}^{T/2}f(t) \cos n\omega_{0}t d t}}\\ {{=\left\{\frac{4}{T}\int_{0}^{T/2}f(t) \cos n\omega_{0}t d t,\quad\mathrm{for} n \mathrm{odd}\right.}}\\ {{\left.0,\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\right.}}\end{array} \tag{17.39}
$$

confirming Eq. (17.33). By following a similar procedure, we can derive  $b_{n}$  as in Eq. (17.33).

Figure 17.13 For Example 17.3.

# Solution:

The function  $f(t)$  is an odd function. Hence  $a_{0} = 0 = a_{n}$ . The period is  $T = 4$ , and  $\omega_{0} = 2\pi /T = \pi /2$ , so that

$$
\begin{array}{l}{{b_{n}=\frac{4}{T}\int_{0}^{T/2}f(t)\sin n\omega_{0}t d t}}\\ {{\quad=\frac{4}{4}\left[\int_{0}^{1}1\sin\frac{n\pi}{2}t d t+\int_{1}^{2}0\sin\frac{n\pi}{2}t d t\right]}}\\ {{\quad=-\frac{2}{n\pi}\cos\frac{n\pi t}{2}\Big|_{0}^{1}=\frac{2}{n\pi}\left(1-\cos\frac{n\pi}{2}\right)}}\end{array}
$$

Hence,

$$
f(t) = \frac{2}{\pi}\sum_{n = 1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n}\Big(1 - \cos \frac{n\pi}{2}\Big)\sin \frac{n\pi}{2} t
$$

which is a Fourier sine series.

Figure 17.15 A half-wave rectified cosine function; for Example 17.4.

# Solution:

This is an even function so that  $b_{n} = 0$ . Also,  $T = 4$ ,  $\omega_{0} = 2\pi /T = \pi /2$ . Over a period,

$$
f(t) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}0, & -2 < t < -1 \\ \cos \frac{\pi}{2} t, & -1 < t < 1 \\ 0, & 1 < t < 2 \end{array} \right.
$$

$$
a_{0} = \frac{2}{T}\int_{0}^{T / 2}f(t)dt = \frac{2}{4}\left[\int_{0}^{1}\cos \frac{\pi}{2} tdt + \int_{1}^{2}0dt\right]
$$

$$
= \frac{1}{2}\frac{2}{\pi}\sin \frac{\pi}{2} t\Big|_{0}^{1} = \frac{1}{\pi}
$$

$$
a_{n} = \frac{4}{T}\int_{0}^{T / 2}f(t)\cos n\omega_{0}tdt = \frac{4}{4}\left[\int_{0}^{1}\cos \frac{\pi}{2} t\cos \frac{n\pi t}{2} dt + 0\right]
$$

But  $\cos A$  cos  $B = \frac{1}{2} [\cos (A + B) + \cos (A - B)]$ . Then

$$
a_{n} = \frac{1}{2}\int_{0}^{1}\left[\cos \frac{\pi}{2} (n + 1)t + \cos \frac{\pi}{2} (n - 1)t\right]dt
$$

For  $n = 1$

$$
a_{1} = \frac{1}{2}\int_{0}^{1}[\cos \pi t + 1]dt = \frac{1}{2}\left[\frac{\sin\pi t}{\pi} +t\right]\Big|_{0}^{1} = \frac{1}{2}
$$

For  $n > 1$

$$
a_{n} = \frac{1}{\pi(n + 1)}\sin \frac{\pi}{2} (n + 1) + \frac{1}{\pi(n - 1)}\sin \frac{\pi}{2} (n - 1)
$$

For  $n = \text{odd} (n = 1,3,5,\ldots)$ ,  $(n + 1)$  and  $(n - 1)$  are both even, so

$$
\sin \frac{\pi}{2} (n + 1) = 0 = \sin \frac{\pi}{2} (n - 1),\qquad n = \text{odd}
$$

For  $n = \text{even} (n = 2,4,6,\ldots)$ ,  $(n + 1)$  and  $(n - 1)$  are both odd. Also,

$$
\sin \frac{\pi}{2} (n + 1) = -\sin \frac{\pi}{2} (n - 1) = \cos \frac{n\pi}{2} = (-1)^{n / 2},\qquad n = \text{even}
$$

Hence,

$$
a_{n} = \frac{(-1)^{n / 2}}{\pi(n + 1)} +\frac{-(-1)^{n / 2}}{\pi(n - 1)} = \frac{-2(-1)^{n / 2}}{\pi(n^{2} - 1)},\qquad n = \text{even}
$$

Thus,

$$
f(t) = \frac{1}{\pi} +\frac{1}{2}\cos \frac{\pi}{2} t - \frac{2}{\pi}\sum_{n = \mathrm{even}}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^{n / 2}}{(n^{2} - 1)}\cos \frac{n\pi}{2} t
$$

To avoid using  $n = 2,4,6,\ldots$  and also to ease computation, we can replace  $n$  by  $2k$ , where  $k = 1,2,3,\ldots$  and obtain

$$
f(t) = \frac{1}{\pi} +\frac{1}{2}\cos \frac{\pi}{2} t - \frac{2}{\pi}\sum_{k = 1}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^{k}}{(4k^{2} - 1)}\cos k\pi t
$$

which is a Fourier cosine series.

\begin{array}{l}{{b_{n}=\frac{4}{4}\int_{-1}^{1}t\sin\frac{n\pi t}{2}d t=\left[\frac{\sin n\pi t/2}{n^{2}\pi^{2}/4}-\frac{t\cos n\pi t/2}{n\pi/2}\right]\mid_{-1}^{1}}}\\ {{=\frac{4}{n^{2}\pi^{2}}\left[\sin\frac{n\pi}{2}-\sin\left(-\frac{n\pi}{2}\right)\right]-\frac{2}{n\pi}\left[\cos\frac{n\pi}{2}-\cos\left(-\frac{n\pi}{2}\right)\right]}}\\ {{=\frac{8}{n^{2}\pi^{2}}\sin\frac{n\pi}{2}}}\end{array}
$$

since  $\sin (- x) = - \sin x$  is an odd function, while  $\cos (- x) = \cos x$  is an even function. Using the identities for  $\sin n\pi /2$  in Table 17.1,

$$
b_{n} = \frac{8}{n^{2}\pi^{2}} (-1)^{(n - 1) / 2},\quad n = \mathrm{odd} = 1,3,5,\ldots
$$

Thus,

$$
f(t) = \sum_{n = 1,3,5}^{\infty}b_{n}\sin \frac{n\pi}{2} t.
$$

Practice Problem 17.5 Determine the Fourier series of the function in Fig. 17.12(a). Take  $A = 5$  and  $T = 2\pi$ .

Answer:  $f(t) = \frac{10}{\pi}\sum_{k = 1}^{\infty}\left(\frac{- 2}{n^{2}\pi}\cos n t + \frac{1}{n}\sin n t\right),n = 2k - 1.$

# 17.4 Circuit Applications

We find that in practice, many circuits are driven by nonsinusoidal periodic functions. To find the steady- state response of a circuit to a nonsinusoidal periodic excitation requires the application of a Fourier series, ac phasor analysis, and the superposition principle. The procedure usually involves four steps.

# Steps for Applying Fourier Series:

1. Express the excitation as a Fourier series.

2. Transform the circuit from the time domain to the frequency domain.

3. Find the response of the dc and ac components in the Fourier series.

4. Add the individual dc and ac responses using the superposition principle.

The first step is to determine the Fourier series expansion of the excitation. For the periodic voltage source shown in Fig. 17.18(a), for example, the Fourier series is expressed as

$$
\nu (t) = V_{0} + \sum_{n = 1}^{\infty}V_{n}\cos (n\omega_{0}t + \theta_{n}) \tag{17.40}
$$

(The same could be done for a periodic current source.) Equation (17.40) shows that  $\nu (t)$  consists of two parts: the dc component  $V_{0}$  and the ac component  $\mathbf{V}_{n} = V_{n} / \theta_{n}$  with several harmonics. This Fourier series representation may be regarded as a set of series- connected sinusoidal sources, with each source having its own amplitude and frequency, as shown in Fig. 17.18(b).

The third step is finding the response to each term in the Fourier series. The response to the dc component can be determined in the frequency domain by setting  $n = 0$  or  $\omega = 0$  as in Fig. 17.19(a), or

in the time domain by replacing all inductors with short circuits and all capacitors with open circuits. The response to the ac component is obtained by applying the phasor techniques covered in Chapter 9, as shown in Fig. 17.19(b). The network is represented by its impedance  $\mathbf{Z}(n\omega_{0})$  or admittance  $\mathbf{Y}(n\omega_{0})$ .  $\mathbf{Z}(n\omega_{0})$  is the input impedance at the source when  $\omega$  is everywhere replaced by  $n\omega_{0}$ , and  $\mathbf{Y}(n\omega_{0})$  is the reciprocal of  $\mathbf{Z}(n\omega_{0})$ .

Finally, following the principle of superposition, we add all the individual responses. For the case shown in Fig. 17.19,

$$
\begin{array}{l}i(t) = i_0(t) + i_1(t) + i_2(t) + \dots \\ = \mathbf{I}_0 + \sum_{n = 1}^{\infty}|\mathbf{I}_n|\cos (n\omega_0t + \psi_n) \end{array} \tag{17.41}
$$

where each component  $\mathbf{I}_n$  with frequency  $n\omega_{0}$  has been transformed to the time domain to get  $i_n(t)$ , and  $\psi_n$  is the argument of  $\mathbf{I}_n$ .

Let the function  $j(t)$  in Example 17.1 be the voltage source  $\nu_s(t)$  in the circuit of Fig. 17.20. Find the response  $\nu_o(t)$  of the circuit.

# Solution:

From Example 17.1,

$$
\nu_{s}(t) = \frac{1}{2} +\frac{2}{\pi}\sum_{k = 1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n}\sin n\pi t,\qquad n = 2k - 1
$$

where  $\omega_n = n\omega_0 = n\pi \mathrm{rad} / s$ . Using phasors, we obtain the response  $\mathbf{V}_o$  in the circuit of Fig. 17.20 by voltage division:

$$
\mathbf{V}_o = \frac{j\omega_nL}{R + j\omega_nL}\mathbf{V}_s = \frac{j2n\pi}{5 + j2n\pi}\mathbf{V}_s
$$

For the dc component ( $\omega_n = 0$  or  $n = 0$ )

$$
\mathbf{V}_s = \frac{1}{2}\qquad \Rightarrow \qquad \mathbf{V}_o = 0
$$

Figure 17.20 For Example 17.6.

This is expected, given that the inductor is a short circuit to dc. For the nth harmonic,

$$
\mathbf{V}_{s} = \frac{2}{n\pi}\angle -90^{\circ} \tag{17.6.1}
$$

and the corresponding response is

$$
\begin{array}{r l} & {\mathbf{V}_{o} = \frac{2n\pi / 90^{\circ}}{\sqrt{25 + 4n^{2}\pi^{2}}\left / \tan^{-1}2n\pi / 5}(\frac{2}{n\pi}\angle -90^{\circ})}\\ & {\quad = \frac{4 / - \tan^{-1}2n\pi / 5}{\sqrt{25 + 4n^{2}\pi^{2}}}} \end{array} \tag{17.6.2}
$$

In the time domain,

$$
\nu_{o}(t) = \sum_{k = 1}^{\infty}\frac{4}{\sqrt{25 + 4n^{2}\pi^{2}}}\cos \Bigl (n\pi t - \tan^{-1}\frac{2n\pi}{5}\Bigr),\qquad n = 2k - 1
$$

The first three terms  $(k = 1,2,3$  or  $n = 1,3,5)$  of the odd harmonics in the summation give us

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{\nu_{o}(t)=0.4981\cos(\pi t-51.49^{\circ})+0.2051\cos(3\pi t-75.14^{\circ})}}\\ {{+0.1257\cos(5\pi t-80.96^{\circ})+\cdots\mathrm{~V~}}}\end{array}
$$

Figure 17.21 For Example 17.6: Amplitude spectrum of the output voltage.

Figure 17.21 shows the amplitude spectrum for output voltage  $\nu_{o}(t)$ , while that of the input voltage  $\nu_{i}(t)$  is in Fig. 17.4(a). Notice that the two spectra are close. Why? We observe that the circuit in Fig. 17.20 is a high- pass filter with the corner frequency  $\omega_{c} = R / L = 2.5 \mathrm{rad / s}$ , which is less than the fundamental frequency  $\omega_{0} = \pi \mathrm{rad / s}$ . The dc component is not passed and the first harmonic is slightly attenuated, but higher harmonics are passed. In fact, from Eqs. (17.6.1) and (17.6.2),  $\mathbf{V}_{o}$  is identical to  $\mathbf{V}_{s}$  for large  $n$ , which is characteristic of a high- pass filter.

Figure 17.22 For Practice Prob. 17.6.

If the sawtooth waveform in Fig. 17.9 (see Practice Prob. 17.2) is the voltage source  $\nu_{s}(t)$  in the circuit of Fig. 17.22, find the response  $\nu_{o}(t)$ .

Answer:  $\nu_{o}(t) = \frac{3}{2} - \frac{3}{\pi}\sum_{n = 1}^{\infty}\frac{\sin(2\pi nt - \tan^{- 1}4n\pi)}{n\sqrt{1 + 16n^{2}\pi^{2}}}\mathrm{V}.$

Find the response  $i_{o}(t)$  of the circuit of Fig. 17.23 if the input voltage  $\nu (t)$  has the Fourier series expansion

$$
\nu (t) = 1 + \sum_{n = 1}^{\infty}\frac{2(-1)^{n}}{1 + n^{2}} (\cos n t - n\sin n t)
$$

# Solution:

Using Eq. (17.13), we can express the input voltage as

$$
\nu (t) = 1 + \sum_{n = 1}^{\infty}\frac{2(-1)^{n}}{\sqrt{1 + n^{2}}}\cos (n t + \tan^{-1}n)
$$

$$
= 1 - 1.414\cos (t + 45^{\circ}) + 0.8944\cos (2t + 63.45^{\circ})
$$

$$
-0.6345\cos (3t + 71.56^{\circ}) - 0.4851\cos (4t + 78.7^{\circ}) + \dots
$$

We notice that  $\omega_{0} = 1,\omega_{n} = n$  rad/s. The impedance at the source is

$$
\mathbf{Z} = 4 + j\omega_{n}2\parallel 4 = 4 + \frac{j\omega_{n}8}{4 + j\omega_{n}2} = \frac{8 + j\omega_{n}8}{2 + j\omega_{n}}
$$

The input current is

$$
\mathbf{I} = \frac{\mathbf{V}}{\mathbf{Z}} = \frac{2 + j\omega_{n}}{8 + j\omega_{n}8}\mathbf{V}
$$

where  $\mathbf{V}$  is the phasor form of the source voltage  $\nu (t)$ . By current division,

$$
\mathbf{I}_{o} = \frac{4}{4 + j\omega_{n}2}\mathbf{I} = \frac{\mathbf{V}}{4 + j\omega_{n}4}
$$

Because  $\omega_{n} = n$ ,  $\mathbf{I}_{o}$  can be expressed as

$$
\mathbf{I}_{o} = \frac{\mathbf{V}}{4\sqrt{1 + n^{2} / \tan^{-1}n}}
$$

For the dc component ( $\omega_{n} = 0$  or  $n = 0$ )

$$
\mathbf{V} = 1\qquad \Rightarrow \qquad \mathbf{I}_{o} = \frac{\mathbf{V}}{4} = \frac{1}{4}
$$

For the  $n$ th harmonic,

$$
\mathbf{V} = \frac{2(-1)^{n}}{\sqrt{1 + n^{2}}}\frac{1}{\tan^{-1}n}
$$

so that

$$
\mathbf{I}_{o} = \frac{1}{4\sqrt{1 + n^{2} / \tan^{-1}n}}\frac{2(-1)^{n}}{\sqrt{1 + n^{2}}}\frac{1}{\tan^{-1}n} = \frac{(-1)^{n}}{2(1 + n^{2})}
$$

In the time domain,

$$
i_{o}(t) = \frac{1}{4} +\sum_{n = 1}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^{n}}{2(1 + n^{2})}\cos nt\mathrm{A}

# 17.5 Average Power and RMS Values

Recall the concepts of average power and rms value of a periodic signal that we discussed in Chapter 11. To find the average power absorbed by a circuit due to a periodic excitation, we write the voltage and current in amplitude- phase form [see Eq. (17.10)] as

$$
\nu (t) = V_{\mathrm{dc}} + \sum_{n = 1}^{\infty}V_{n}\cos (n\omega_{0}t - \theta_{n}) \tag{17.42}
$$

$$
i(t) = I_{\mathrm{dc}} + \sum_{m = 1}^{\infty}I_{m}\cos (m\omega_{0}t - \phi_{m}) \tag{17.43}
$$

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-14/63c420e9-9220-47ad-935a-09e6b2aeb2a8/54b42aa8fb67cbb6b10f47d5ade40f015f365bf3acd3bd2ed201c0d007366848.jpg)  
Figure 17.25 The voltage polarity reference and current reference direction.

Following the passive sign convention (Fig. 17.25), the average power is

$$
P = \frac{1}{T}\int_{0}^{T}\nu i dt \tag{17.44}
$$

Substituting Eqs. (17.42) and (17.43) into Eq. (17.44) gives

$$
\begin{array}{l}{{P=\frac{1}{T}\int_{0}^{T}V_{\mathrm{dc}}I_{\mathrm{dc}}d t+\sum_{m=1}^{\infty}\frac{I_{m}V_{\mathrm{dc}}}{T}\int_{0}^{T}\cos(m\omega_{0}t-\phi_{m})d t}}\\ {{~+\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{V_{n}I_{\mathrm{dc}}}{T}\int_{0}^{T}\cos(n\omega_{0}t-\theta_{n})d t}}\\ {{~+\sum_{m=1}^{\infty}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{V_{n}I_{m}}{T}\int_{0}^{T}\cos(n\omega_{0}t-\theta_{n})\cos(m\omega_{0}t-\phi_{m})d t}}\end{array} \tag{17.45}
$$

The second and third integrals vanish, since we are integrating the cosine over its period. According to Eq. (17.4e), all terms in the fourth integral are zero when  $m\neq n$ . By evaluating the first integral and applying Eq. (17.4g) to the fourth integral for the case  $m = n$ , we obtain

$$
P = V_{\mathrm{dc}}I_{\mathrm{dc}} + \frac{1}{2}\sum_{n = 1}^{\infty}V_{n}I_{n}\cos (\theta_{n} - \phi_{n}) \tag{17.46}
$$

This shows that in average- power calculation involving periodic voltage and current, the total average power is the sum of the average powers in each harmonically related voltage and current.

Given a periodic function  $f(t)$ , its rms value (or the effective value) is given by

$$
F_{\mathrm{rms}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{T}\int_{0}^{T}f^{2}(t)dt} \tag{17.47}
$$

Substituting  $f(t)$  in Eq. (17.10) into Eq. (17.47) and noting that  $(a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2$ , we obtain

$$
\begin{array}{l}{{F_{\mathrm{rms}}^{2}=\frac{1}{T}\int_{0}^{T}\left[a_{0}^{2}+2\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}a_{0}A_{n}\cos(n\omega_{0}t+\phi_{n})\right.}}\\ {{\left.+\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\sum_{m=1}^{\infty}A_{n}A_{m}\cos(n\omega_{0}t+\phi_{n})\cos(m\omega_{0}t+\phi_{m})\right]d t}}\end{array}
$$

$$
= \frac{1}{T}\int_{0}^{T}a_{0}^{2}dt + 2\sum_{n = 1}^{\infty}a_{0}A_{n}\frac{1}{T}\int_{0}^{T}\cos (n\omega_{0}t + \phi_{n})dt
$$

$$
+\sum_{n = 1}^{\infty}\sum_{m = 1}^{\infty}A_{n}A_{m}\frac{1}{T}\int_{0}^{T}\cos (n\omega_{0}t + \phi_{n})\cos (m\omega_{0}t + \phi_{m})dt
$$

Distinct integers  $n$  and  $m$  have been introduced to handle the product of the two series summations. Using the same reasoning as above, we get

$$
F_{\mathrm{rms}}^{2} = a_{0}^{2} + \frac{1}{2}\sum_{n = 1}^{\infty}A_{n}^{2}
$$

or

$$
F_{\mathrm{rms}} = \sqrt{a_{0}^{2} + \frac{1}{2}\sum_{n = 1}^{\infty}A_{n}^{2}} \tag{17.49}
$$

In terms of Fourier coefficients  $a_{n}$  and  $b_{n}$ , Eq. (17.49) may be written as

$$
F_{\mathrm{rms}} = \sqrt{a_{0}^{2} + \frac{1}{2}\sum_{n = 1}^{\infty}\left(a_{n}^{2} + b_{n}^{2}\right)} \tag{17.50}
$$

If  $f(t)$  is the current through a resistor  $R$ , then the power dissipated in the resistor is

$$
P = RF_{\mathrm{rms}}^{2} \tag{17.51}
$$

Or if  $f(t)$  is the voltage across a resistor  $R$ , the power dissipated in the resistor is

$$
P = \frac{F_{\mathrm{rms}}^{2}}{R} \tag{17.52}
$$

One can avoid specifying the nature of the signal by choosing a 1- Ω resistance. The power dissipated by the 1- Ω resistance is

$$
P_{1\Omega} = F_{\mathrm{rms}}^{2} = a_{0}^{2} + \frac{1}{2}\sum_{n = 1}^{\infty}\left(a_{n}^{2} + b_{n}^{2}\right) \tag{17.53}
$$

This result is known as Parseval's theorem. Notice that  $a_{0}^{2}$  is the power in the dc component, while  $\frac{1}{2} (a_{n}^{2} + b_{n}^{2})$  is the ac power in the  $n$ th harmonic. Thus, Parseval's theorem states that the average power in a periodic signal is the sum of the average power in its dc component and the average powers in its harmonics.

Historical note: Named after the French mathematician Marc- Antoine Parseval Deschemes (1755- 1836).

Figure 17.26 For Example 17.8.

Determine the average power supplied to the circuit in Fig. 17.26 if  $i(t) = 2 + 10\cos (t + 10^{\circ}) + 6\cos (3t + 35^{\circ})$  A.

# Solution:

The input impedance of the network is

$$
\mathbf{Z} = 10| \frac{1}{j2\omega} = \frac{10(1 / j2\omega)}{10 + 1 / j2\omega} = \frac{10}{1 + j20\omega}
$$

Hence,

$$
\mathbf{V} = \mathbf{I}\mathbf{Z} = \frac{10\mathbf{I}}{\sqrt{1 + 400\omega^{2}} / \tan^{-1}20\omega}
$$

For the dc component,  $\omega = 0$

$$
\mathbf{I} = 2A\qquad \Rightarrow \qquad \mathbf{V} = 10(2) = 20\mathrm{~V}
$$

This is expected, because the capacitor is an open circuit to dc and the entire 2- A current flows through the resistor. For  $\omega = 1$  rad/s,

$$
\begin{array}{r l r}{\mathbf{I} = 10\big / 10^{\circ}} & {} & \Rightarrow \qquad \mathbf{V} = \frac{10(10\big / 10^{\circ})}{\sqrt{1 + 400\big / \tan^{-1}20}}}\\ & {} & {= 5\big / - 77.14^{\circ}} \end{array}
$$

For  $\omega = 3$  rad/s,

$$
\begin{array}{r l r}{\mathbf{I} = 6\big / 35^{\circ}} & {} & \Rightarrow \qquad \mathbf{V} = \frac{10(6\big / 35^{\circ})}{\sqrt{1 + 3600\big / \tan^{-1}60}}}\\ & {} & {= 1\big / - 54.04^{\circ}} \end{array}
$$

Thus, in the time domain,

$$
\nu (t) = 20 + 5\cos (t - 77.14^{\circ}) + 1\cos (3t - 54.04^{\circ})\mathrm{~V~}
$$

We obtain the average power supplied to the circuit by applying Eq. (17.46), as

$$
P = V_{\mathrm{dc}}I_{\mathrm{dc}} + \frac{1}{2}\sum_{n = 1}^{\infty}V_{n}I_{n}\cos (\theta_{n} - \phi_{n})
$$

To get the proper signs of  $\theta_{n}$  and  $\phi_{n}$ , we have to compare  $\nu$  and  $i$  in this example with Eqs. (17.42) and (17.43). Thus,

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{P=20(2)+\frac{1}{2}(5)(10)\cos[77.14^{\circ}-(-10^{\circ})]}}\\ {{+\frac{1}{2}(1)(6)\cos[54.04^{\circ}-(-35^{\circ})]}}\\ {{=40+1.247+0.05=41.5\mathrm{~W}}}\end{array}
$$

Alternatively, we can find the average power absorbed by the resistor as

$$
P = \frac{V_{\mathrm{dc}}^{2}}{R} +\frac{1}{2}\sum_{n = 1}^{\infty}\frac{|V_{n}|^{2}}{R} = \frac{20^{2}}{10} +\frac{1}{2}\bullet \frac{5^{2}}{10} +\frac{1}{2}\bullet \frac{1^{2}}{10}
$$

$$
= 40 + 1.25 + 0.05 = 41.5\mathrm{~W~}
$$

which is the same as the power supplied, since the capacitor absorbs no average power.

The voltage and current at the terminals of a circuit are

$$
\begin{array}{l}{\nu (t) = 128 + 192\cos 120\pi t + 96\cos (360\pi t - 30^{\circ})}\\ {i(t) = 4\cos (120\pi t - 10^{\circ}) + 1.6\cos (360\pi t - 60^{\circ})} \end{array}
$$

Find the average power absorbed by the circuit.

Answer: 444.7 W.

Find an estimate for the rms value of the voltage in Example 17.7.

# Solution:

From Example 17.7,  $\nu (t)$  is expressed as

$$
\begin{array}{l}{\nu (t) = 1 - 1.414\cos (t + 45^{\circ}) + 0.8944\cos (2t + 63.45^{\circ})}\\ {\qquad -0.6345\cos (3t + 71.56^{\circ})}\\ {\qquad -0.4851\cos (4t + 78.7^{\circ}) + \dots \mathrm{~V~}} \end{array}
$$

Using Eq. (17.49), we find

$$
\begin{array}{l}{{V_{\mathrm{rms}}=\sqrt{a_{0}^{2}+\frac{1}{2}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}A_{n}^{2}}}}\\ {{\mathrm{~}}}\\ {{\mathrm{~}=\sqrt{1^{2}+\frac{1}{2}[(-1.414)^{2}+(0.8944)^{2}+(-0.6345)^{2}+(-0.4851)^{2}+\ldots]}}}\\ {{\mathrm{~}=\sqrt{2.7186}=1.649\mathrm{~V~}}}\end{array}
$$

This is only an estimate, as we have not taken enough terms of the series. The actual function represented by the Fourier series is

$$

$$

Answer: 29.61 A.

# 17.6 Exponential Fourier Series

A compact way of expressing the Fourier series in Eq. (17.3) is to put it in exponential form. This requires that we represent the sine and cosine functions in the exponential form using Euler's identity:

$$
\begin{array}{l}{{\cos n\omega_{0}t=\frac{1}{2}\left[e^{j n\omega_{0}t}+e^{-j n\omega_{0}t}\right]}}\\ {{\sin n\omega_{0}t=\frac{1}{2j}\left[e^{j n\omega_{0}t}-e^{-j n\omega_{0}t}\right]}}\end{array} \tag{17.54b}
$$

Substituting Eq. (17.54) into Eq. (17.3) and collecting terms, we obtain

$$
f(t) = a_{0} + \frac{1}{2}\sum_{n = 1}^{\infty}\left[(a_{n} - j b_{n})e^{i n\omega_{0}t} + (a_{n} + j b_{n})e^{-j n\omega_{0}t}\right] \tag{17.55}
$$

If we define a new coefficient  $c_{n}$  so that

$$
c_{0} = a_{0},\qquad c_{n} = \frac{(a_{n} - j b_{n})}{2},\qquad c_{-n} = c_{n}^{*} = \frac{(a_{n} + j b_{n})}{2} \tag{17.56}
$$

then  $f(t)$  becomes

$$
f(t) = c_{0} + \sum_{n = 1}^{\infty}(c_{n}e^{j n\omega_{0}t} + c_{-n}e^{-j n\omega_{0}t}) \tag{17.57}
$$

or

$$
f(t) = \sum_{n = -\infty}^{\infty}c_{n}^{e j n\omega_{0}t} \tag{17.58}
$$

This is the complex or exponential Fourier series representation of  $f(t)$ . Note that this exponential form is more compact than the sine- cosine form in Eq. (17.3). Although the exponential Fourier series coefficients  $c_{n}$  can also be obtained from  $a_{n}$  and  $b_{n}$  using Eq. (17.56), they can also be obtained directly from  $f(t)$  as

$$
c_{n} = \frac{1}{T}\int_{0}^{T}f(t)e^{-e j n\omega_{0}t}d t \tag{17.59}
$$

where  $\omega_{0} = 2\pi /T$ , as usual. The plots of the magnitude and phase of  $c_{n}$  versus  $n\omega_{0}$  are called the complex amplitude spectrum and complex phase spectrum of  $f(t)$ , respectively. The two spectra form the complex frequency spectrum of  $f(t)$ .

The exponential Fourier series of a periodic function  $f(t)$  describes the spectrum of  $f(t)$  in terms of the amplitude and phase angle of ac components at positive and negative harmonic frequencies.

The coefficients of the three forms of Fourier series (sine- cosine form, amplitude- phase form, and exponential form) are related by

$$
A_{n} / \phi_{n} = a_{n} - j b_{n} = 2c_{n} \tag{17.60}
$$

or

$$
c_{n} = |c_{n}| / \theta_{n} = \frac{\sqrt{a_{n}^{2} + b_{n}^{2}}}{2} / - \tan^{-1}b_{n} / a_{n} \tag{17.61}
$$

if only  $a_{n} > 0$ . Note that the phase  $\theta_{n}$  of  $c_{n}$  is equal to  $\phi_{n}$ .

In terms of the Fourier complex coefficients  $c_{n}$ , the rms value of a periodic signal  $f(t)$  can be found as

$$
\begin{array}{l}{{ F_{\mathrm{rms}}^{2}=\frac{1}{T}\int_{0}^{T}f^{2}(t)d t=\frac{1}{T}\int_{0}^{T}f(t)\left[\sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}c_{n}e^{j n\omega_{0}t}\right]d t}}\\ {{\quad=\sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}c_{n}^{2}\left[\frac{1}{T}\int_{0}^{T}f(t)e^{j n\omega_{0}t}d t\right]}}\\ {{\quad=\sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}c_{n}c_{n}^{*}=\sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}|c_{n}|^{2}}}\end{array} \tag{17.62}
$$

or

$$
F_{\mathrm{rms}} = \sqrt{\sum_{n = -\infty}^{\infty}|c_{n}|^{2}} \tag{17.63}
$$

Equation (17.62) can be written as

$$
F_{\mathrm{rms}}^{2} = |c_{0}|^{2} + 2\sum_{n = 1}^{\infty}|c_{n}|^{2} \tag{17.64}
$$

Again, the power dissipated by a  $1 - \Omega$  resistance is

$$
P_{\Omega} = F_{\mathrm{rms}}^{2} = \sum_{n = -\infty}^{\infty}|c_{n}|^{2} \tag{17.65}
$$

which is a restatement of Parseval's theorem. The power spectrum of the signal  $f(t)$  is the plot of  $\left|c_{n}\right|^{2}$  versus  $n\omega_{0}$ . If  $f(t)$  is the voltage across a resistor  $R$ , the average power absorbed by the resistor is  $F_{\mathrm{rms}}^{2} / R$ ; if  $f(t)$  is the current through  $R$ , the power is  $F_{\mathrm{rms}}^{2}R$ .

As an illustration, consider the periodic pulse train of Fig. 17.27. Our goal is to obtain its amplitude and phase spectra. The period of the pulse train is  $T = 10$ , so that  $\omega_{0} = 2\pi /T = \pi /5$ . Using Eq. (17.59),

$$
\begin{array}{l}{{c_{n}=\frac{1}{T}\int_{-T/2}^{T/2}f(t)e^{-j n\omega_{0}t}d t=\frac{1}{10}\int_{-1}^{1}10e^{-j n\omega_{0}t}d t}}\\ {{=\frac{1}{-j n\omega_{0}}e^{-j n\omega_{0}t}\Big|_{-1}^{1}=\frac{1}{-j n\omega_{0}}(e^{-j n\omega_{0}}-e^{j n\omega_{0}})}}\\ {{=\frac{2}{n\omega_{0}}\frac{e^{j n\omega_{0}}-e^{-j n\omega_{0}}}{2j}=2\frac{\sin n\omega_{0}}{n\omega_{0}},\qquad\omega_{0}=\frac{\pi}{5}}}\\ {{=2\frac{\sin n\pi/5}{n\pi/5}}}\end{array} \tag{17.66}
$$

Figure 17.27 The periodic pulse train.

and

$$
f(t) = 2\sum_{n = -\infty}^{\infty}\frac{\sin n\pi / 5}{n\pi / 5} e^{jn\pi /5} \tag{17.67}
$$

Notice from Eq. (17.66) that  $c_{n}$  is the product of 2 and a function of the form  $\sin x / x$ . This function is known as the sinc function; we write it as

$$
\operatorname {sinc}(x) = \frac{\sin x}{x} \tag{17.68}
$$

Some properties of the sinc function are important here. For zero argument, the value of the sinc function is unity,

$$
\operatorname {sinc}(0) = 1 \tag{17.69}
$$

The sinc function is called the sampling function in communication theory, where it is very useful.

This is obtained by applying L'Hopital's rule to Eq. (17.68). For an integral multiple of  $\pi$ , the value of the sinc function is zero,

$$
\operatorname {sinc}(n\pi) = 0, \qquad n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots \tag{17.70}
$$

Also, the sinc function shows even symmetry. With all this in mind, we can obtain the amplitude and phase spectra of  $f(t)$ . From Eq. (17.66), the magnitude is

$$
|c_{n}| = 2\left|\frac{\sin n\pi / 5}{n\pi / 5}\right| \tag{17.71}
$$

while the phase is

$$
\theta_{n} = \left\{ \begin{array}{c c}{0^{\circ},} & {\sin \frac{n\pi}{5} >0}\\ {180^{\circ},} & {\sin \frac{n\pi}{5} < 0} \end{array} \right. \tag{17.72}
$$

Examining the input and output spectra allows visualization of the effect of a circuit on a periodic signal.

Figure 17.28 The amplitude of a periodic pulse train.

Figure 17.28 shows the plot of  $|c_{n}|$  versus  $n$  for  $n$  varying from  $- 10$  to 10, where  $n = \omega /\omega_{0}$  is the normalized frequency. Figure 17.29 shows the plot of  $\theta_{n}$  versus  $n$ . Both the amplitude spectrum and phase spectrum are called line spectra, because the values of  $|c_{n}|$  and  $\theta_{n}$  occur only at discrete values of frequencies. The spacing between the lines is  $\omega_{0}$ . The power spectrum, which is the plot of  $|c_{n}|^{2}$  versus  $n\omega_{0}$ , can also be plotted. Notice that the sinc function forms the envelope of the amplitude spectrum.

# Example 17.10

Find the exponential Fourier series expansion of the periodic function  $f(t) = e^{t}$ ,  $0 < t < 2\pi$  with  $f(t + 2\pi) = f(t)$ .

# Solution:

Because  $T = 2\pi$ ,  $\omega_{0} = 2\pi /T = 1$ . Hence,

$$
\begin{array}{l}{{c_{n}=\frac{1}{T}\int_{0}^{T}f(t)e^{-j n\omega_{0}t}d t=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{0}^{2\pi}e^{t}e^{-j n t}d t}}\\ {{=\frac{1}{2\pi}\frac{1}{1-j n}e^{(1-j n)t}|_{0}^{2\pi}=\frac{1}{2\pi(1-j n)}[e^{2\pi}e^{-j2\pi n}-1]}\end{array}
$$

But by Euler's identity,

$$
e^{-2\pi n} = \cos 2\pi n - j\sin 2\pi n = 1 - j0 = 1
$$

Thus,

$$
c_{n} = \frac{1}{2\pi(1 - j n)}\left[e^{2\pi} - 1\right] = \frac{85}{1 - j n}
$$

The complex Fourier series is

$$
f(t) = \sum_{n = -\infty}^{\infty}\frac{85}{1 - j n} e^{j n t}
$$

We may want to plot the complex frequency spectrum of  $f(t)$ . If we let  $c_{n} = |c_{n}| / \theta_{n}$ , then

$$
|c_{n}| = \frac{85}{\sqrt{1 + n^{2}}},\qquad \theta_{n} = \tan^{-1}n
$$

By inserting in negative and positive values of  $n$ , we obtain the amplitude and the phase plots of  $c_{n}$  versus  $n\omega_{0} = n$ , as in Fig. 17.30.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-14/63c420e9-9220-47ad-935a-09e6b2aeb2a8/c47129b179d5992a621019f2ce00637d5506a2d04d0d5b641c1cb35eba3acb4f.jpg)

Answer:  $f(t) = \frac{1}{2} - \sum_{n = - \infty}^{\infty}\frac{j}{n\pi} e^{j n\pi t}$ .  $n\neq 0$ $n\neq j d d$

Find the complex Fourier series of the sawtooth wave in Fig. 17.9. Plot the amplitude and the phase spectra.

# Solution:

From Fig. 17.9,  $f(t) = t$ ,  $0< t< 1$ ,  $T = 1$  so that  $\omega_{0} = 2\pi /T = 2\pi$ . Hence,

$$
c_{n} = \frac{1}{T}\int_{0}^{T}f(t)e^{-j n\omega_{0}t}d t = \frac{1}{1}\int_{0}^{1}t e^{-j2n\pi t}d t \tag{17.11.1}
$$

But

$$
\int t e^{a t}d t = \frac{e^{a t}}{a^{2}}\left(a x - 1\right) + C
$$

Applying this to Eq. (17.11.1) gives

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{c_{n}=\frac{e^{-j2n\pi t}}{\left(-j2n\pi\right)^{2}}(-j2n\pi t-1)\Big|_{0}^{1}}}\\ {{{}}}\\ {{=\frac{e^{-j2n\pi}\left(-j2n\pi-1\right)+1}{-4n^{2}\pi^{2}}}}\end{array} \tag{17.11.2}
$$

Again,

$$
e^{-j2\pi n} = \cos 2\pi n - j\sin 2\pi n = 1 - j0 = 1
$$

so that Eq. (17.11.2) becomes

$$
c_{n} = \frac{-j2n\pi}{-4n^{2}\pi^{2}} = \frac{j}{2n\pi} \tag{17.11.3}
$$

This does not include the case when  $n = 0$ . When  $n = 0$

$$
c_{0} = \frac{1}{T}\int_{0}^{T}f(t)d t = \frac{1}{1}\int_{0}^{1}t d t = \frac{t^{2}}{2}\Big|_{1}^{0} = 0.5 \tag{17.11.4}
$$

Hence,

$$
f(t) = 0.5 + \sum_{n = -\infty \atop n\neq 0}^{\infty}\frac{j}{2n\pi} e^{j2n\pi t} \tag{17.11.5}
$$

and

$$
|c_{n}| = \left\{ \begin{array}{c c}{\frac{1}{2|n|\pi},} & {n\neq 0}\\ {0.5,} & {n = 0} \end{array} \right.,\qquad \theta_{n} = 90^{\circ},\qquad n\neq 0 \tag{17.11.6}
$$

By plotting  $|c_{n}|$  and  $\theta_{n}$  for different  $n$ , we obtain the amplitude spectrum and the phase spectrum shown in Fig. 17.31.

# 17.7 Fourier Analysis with PSpice

Fourier analysis is usually performed with PSpice in conjunction with transient analysis. Therefore, we must do a transient analysis to perform a Fourier analysis.

To perform the Fourier analysis of a waveform, we need a circuit whose input is the waveform and whose output is the Fourier decomposition. A suitable circuit is a current (or voltage) source in series with a  $1 - \Omega$  resistor as shown in Fig. 17.33. The waveform is inputted as  $\nu_{s}(t)$  using VPULSE for a pulse or VSIN for a sinusoid, and the attributes of the waveform are set over its period  $T$ . The output  $\mathrm{V}(1)$  from node 1 is the dc level  $(a_{0})$  and the first nine harmonics  $(A_{n})$  with their corresponding phases  $\psi_{n}$ ; that is,

$$
\nu_{s}(t) = a_{0} + \sum_{n = 1}^{9}A_{n}\sin (n\omega_{0}t + \psi_{n}) \tag{17.73}
$$

where

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-14/63c420e9-9220-47ad-935a-09e6b2aeb2a8/2b9dcd0d3bd01795f62b120a7d7d529db65d1f537dc2a7b19585acb058f8d622.jpg)  
Figure 17.33 Fourier analysis with PSpice using: (a) a current source, (b) a voltage source.

$$
A_{n} = \sqrt{a_{n}^{2} + b_{n}^{2}},\qquad \psi_{n} = \phi_{n} - \frac{\pi}{2},\qquad \phi_{n} = \tan^{-1}\frac{b_{n}}{a_{n}} \tag{17.74}
$$

Notice in Eq. (17.74) that the PSpice output is in the sine and angle form rather than the cosine and angle form in Eq. (17.10). The PSpice output also includes the normalized Fourier coefficients. Each coefficient  $a_{n}$  is normalized by dividing it by the magnitude of the fundamental  $a_{1}$ , so that the normalized component is  $a_{n} / a_{1}$ . The corresponding phase  $\psi_{n}$  is normalized by subtracting from it the phase  $\psi_{1}$  of the fundamental, so that the normalized phase is  $\psi_{n} - \psi_{1}$ .

There are two types of Fourier analyses offered by PSpice for Windows: Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) performed by the PSpice

program and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) performed by the PSpice  $A / D$  program. While DFT is an approximation of the exponential Fourier series, FTT is an algorithm for rapid efficient numerical computation of DFT. A full discussion of DFT and FTT is beyond the scope of this book.

# 17.7.1 Discrete Fourier Transform

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-14/63c420e9-9220-47ad-935a-09e6b2aeb2a8/88cda78038aee7db68c80393ffb064112f49c1f757f3a521f86bd7bf0450b1bf.jpg)  
Figure 17.34 Transient dialog box.

A discrete Fourier transform (DFT) is performed by the PSpice program, which tabulates the harmonics in an output file. To enable a Fourier analysis, we select Analysis/Setup/Transient and bring up the Transient dialog box, shown in Fig. 17.34. The Print Step should be a small fraction of the period  $T$ , while the Final Time could be 6T. The Center Frequency is the fundamental frequency  $f_{0} = 1 / T$ . The particular variable whose DFT is desired, V(1) in Fig. 17.34, is entered in the Output Vars command box. In addition to filling in the Transient dialog box, DCLICK Enable Fourier. With the Fourier analysis enabled and the schematic saved, run PSpice by selecting Analysis/ Simulate as usual. The program executes a harmonic decomposition into Fourier components of the result of the transient analysis. The results are sent to an output file which can be retrieved by selecting Analysis/Examine Output. The output file includes the dc value and the first nine harmonics by default, although you can specify more in the Number of harmonics box (see Fig. 17.34).

# 17.7.2 Fast Fourier Transform

A fast Fourier transform (FFT) is performed by the PSpice  $A / D$  program and displays as a PSpice  $A / D$  plot the complete spectrum of a transient expression. As explained above, we first construct the schematic in Fig. 17.33(b) and enter the attributes of the waveform. We also need to enter the Print Step and the Final Time in the Transient dialog box. Once this is done, we can obtain the FFT of the waveform in two ways.

One way is to insert a voltage marker at node 1 in the schematic of the circuit in Fig. 17.33(b). After saving the schematic and selecting Analysis/Simulate, the waveform V(1) will be displayed in the PSpice  $A / D$  window. Double clicking the FFT icon in the PSpice  $A / D$  menu will automatically replace the waveform with its FFT. From the FFT- generated graph, we can obtain the harmonics. In case the FFT- generated graph is crowded, we can use the User Defined data range (see Fig. 17.35) to specify a smaller range.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-14/63c420e9-9220-47ad-935a-09e6b2aeb2a8/42a2b6f96ed27ed4368b02e7d2f3e9bec17ac9cae6fc1174ada63c080de9d06b.jpg)  
Figure 17.35  $X$  axis settings dialog box.

Another way of obtaining the FFT of  $\mathrm{V}(1)$  is to not insert a voltage marker at node 1 in the schematic. After selecting Analysis/ Simulate, the PSpice  $A / D$  window will come up with no graph on it. We select Trace/Add and type  $\mathrm{V}(1)$  in the Trace Command box and DCLICKL OK. We now select Plot/X- Axis Settings to bring up the  $X$ - Axis Setting dialog box shown in Fig. 17.35 and then select Fourier/ OK. This will cause the FFT of the selected trace (or traces) to be displayed. This second approach is useful for obtaining the FFT of any trace associated with the circuit.

A major advantage of the FFT method is that it provides graphical output. But its major disadvantage is that some of the harmonics may be too small to see.

In both DFT and FFT, we should let the simulation run for a large number of cycles and use a small value of Step Ceiling (in the Transient dialog box) to ensure accurate results. The Final Time in the Transient dialog box should be at least five times the period of the signal to allow the simulation to reach steady state.

Use PSpice to determine the Fourier coefficients of the signal in Fig. 17.1.

# Solution:

Figure 17.36 shows the schematic for obtaining the Fourier coefficients. With the signal in Fig. 17.1 in mind, we enter the attributes of the voltage source VPULSE as shown in Fig. 17.36. We will solve this example using both the DFT and FFT approaches.

METHOD 1 DFT Approach: (The voltage marker in Fig. 17.36 is not needed for this method.) From Fig. 17.1, it is evident that  $T = 2$  s,

$$
f_{0} = \frac{1}{T} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \mathrm{Hz}
$$

So, in the transient dialog box, we select the Final Time as  $6T = 12$  s, the Print Step as  $0.01$  s, the Step Ceiling as  $10 \mathrm{ms}$ , the Center Frequency as  $0.5 \mathrm{Hz}$ , and the output variable as  $\mathrm{V}(1)$ . (In fact, Fig. 17.34 is for this particular example.) When PSpice is run, the output file contains the following result:

Comparing the result with that in Eq. (17.1.7) (see Example 17.1) or with the spectra in Fig. 17.4 shows a close agreement. From Eq. (17.1.7), the dc component is 0.5 while PSpice gives 0.498995. Also, the signal has only odd harmonics with phase  $\psi_{n} = - 90^{\circ}$ , whereas PSpice seems to indicate that the signal has even harmonics although the magnitudes of the even harmonics are small.

- METHOD 2 FFT Approach: With voltage marker in Fig. 17.36 in place, we run PSpice and obtain the waveform V(1) shown in Fig. 17.37(a) on the PSpice A/D window. By double clicking the FFT icon in the PSpice A/D menu and changing the X-axis setting to 0 to  $10\mathrm{Hz}$ , we obtain the FFT of V(1) as shown in Fig. 17.37(b). The FFT-generated graph contains the dc and harmonic components within the selected frequency range. Notice that the magnitudes and frequencies of the harmonics agree with the DFT-generated tabulated values.

If  $\nu_{s} = 12\sin (200\pi t)u(t)\mathrm{V}$  in the circuit of Fig. 17.38, find  $i(t)$ .

# Solution:

1. Define. Although the problem appears to be clearly stated, it might be advisable to check with the individual who assigned the problem to make sure he or she wants the transient response rather than the steady-state response; in the latter case the problem becomes trivial.

2. Present. We are to determine the response  $i(t)$  given the input  $\nu_{s}(t)$  using PSpice and Fourier analysis.

3. Alternative. We will use DFT to perform the initial analysis. We will then check using the FFT approach.

4. Attempt. The schematic is shown in Fig. 17.39. We may use the DFT approach to obtain the Fourier coefficients of  $i(t)$ . Because the period of the input waveform is  $T = 1 / 100 = 10 \mathrm{ms}$ , in the Transient dialog box we select Print Step:  $0.1 \mathrm{ms}$ , Final Time:  $100 \mathrm{ms}$ , Center Frequency:  $100 \mathrm{Hz}$ , Number of harmonics: 4, and Output Wars: I(L1). When the circuit is simulated, the output file includes the following:

With the Fourier coefficients, the Fourier series describing the current  $i(t)$  can be obtained using Eq. (17.73); that is,

$$
\begin{array}{l}{i(t) = 8.5833 + 8.73\sin (2\pi \cdot 100t - 89.84^{\circ})}\\ {\qquad +0.1017\sin (2\pi \cdot 200t - 83.06^{\circ})}\\ {\qquad +0.068\sin (2\pi \cdot 300t - 82.35^{\circ}) + \dots \mathrm{mA}} \end{array}
$$

5. Evaluate. We can also use the FFT approach to cross-check our result. The current marker is inserted at pin 1 of the inductor as shown in Fig. 17.39. Running PSpice will automatically produce the plot of I(L1) in the PSpice A/D window, as shown in Fig. 17.40(a).

Figure 17.40 For Example 17.13: (a) plot of  $i(t)$ , (b) the FFT of  $i(t)$ .

By double clicking the FFT icon and setting the range of the X- axis from 0 to  $200 \mathrm{~Hz}$ , we generate the FFT of I(L1) shown in Fig. 17.40(b). It is clear from the FFT- generated plot that only the dc component and the first harmonic are visible. Higher harmonics are negligibly small.

One final observation, does the answer make sense? Let us look at the actual transient response,  $i(t) = (9.549e^{- 0.5t} - 9.549) \cos (200 \pi t) u(t) \mathrm{mA}$ . The period of the cosine wave is  $10 \mathrm{~ms}$  while the time constant of the exponential is  $2000 \mathrm{~ms}$  (2 seconds). So, the answer we obtained by Fourier techniques does agree.

6. Satisfactory? Clearly, we have solved the problem satisfactorily using the specified approach. We can now present our results as a solution to the problem.

# 17.8 Applications

17.8 ApplicationsWe demonstrated in Section 17.4 that the Fourier series expansion permits the application of the phasor techniques used in ac analysis to circuits containing nonsinusoidal periodic excitations. The Fourier series has many other practical applications, particularly in communications and signal processing. Typical applications include spectrum analysis, filtering, rectification, and harmonic distortion. We will consider two of these: spectrum analyzers and filters.

# 17.8.1 Spectrum Analyzers

The Fourier series provides the spectrum of a signal. As we have seen, the spectrum consists of the amplitudes and phases of the harmonics versus frequency. By providing the spectrum of a signal  $f(t)$  , the Fourier series helps us identify the pertinent features of the signal. It demonstrates which frequencies are playing an important role in the shape of the output and which ones are not. For example, audible sounds have significant components in the frequency range of  $20\mathrm{Hz}$  to  $15\mathrm{kHz}$  while visible light signals range from  $10^{5}$  to  $10^{6}\mathrm{GHz}$  . Table 17.4 presents some other signals and the frequency ranges of their components. A periodic function is said to be band- limited if its amplitude spectrum contains only a finite number of coefficients  $A_{n}$  or  $c_{n}$  . In this case, the Fourier series becomes

$$
f(t) = \sum_{n = -N}^{N}c_{n}e^{in\phi_{n}t} = a_{0} + \sum_{n = 1}^{N}A_{n}\cos (n\omega_{0}t + \phi_{n}) \tag{17.75}
$$

This shows that we need only  $2N + 1$  terms (namely,  $a_0,A_1,A_2,\ldots ,$ $A_{N},\phi_{1},\phi_{2},\ldots ,\phi_{N})$  to completely specify  $f(t)$  if  $a_{0}$  is known. This leads to the sampling theorem: a band- limited periodic function whose Fourier series contains  $N$  harmonics is uniquely specified by its values at  $2N + 1$  instants in one period.

A spectrum analyzer is an instrument that displays the amplitude of the components of a signal versus frequency. It shows the various frequency components (spectral lines) that indicate the amount of energy at each frequency.

It is unlike an oscilloscope, which displays the entire signal (all components) versus time. An oscilloscope shows the signal in the time domain, while the spectrum analyzer shows the signal in the frequency domain. There is perhaps no instrument more useful to a circuit analyst than the spectrum analyzer. An analyzer can conduct noise and spurious signal analysis, phase checks, electromagnetic interference and filter examinations, vibration measurements, radar measurements, and more. Spectrum analyzers are commercially available in various sizes and shapes. Figure 17.42 displays a typical one.

# 17.8.2 Filters

17.8.2 FiltersFilters are an important component of electronics and communications systems. Chapter 14 presented a full discussion on passive and active filters. Here, we investigate how to design filters to select the fundamental component (or any desired harmonic) of the input signal and reject other harmonics. This filtering process cannot be accomplished

without the Fourier series expansion of the input signal. For the purpose of illustration, we will consider two cases, a low- pass filter and a bandpass filter. In Example 17.6, we already looked at a high- pass  $RL$  filter.

The output of a low- pass filter depends on the input signal, the transfer function  $H(\omega)$  of the filter, and the corner or half- power frequency  $\omega_{c}$ . We recall that  $\omega_{c} = 1 / RC$  for an  $RC$  passive filter. As shown in Fig. 17.43(a), the low- pass filter passes the dc and low- frequency components, while blocking the high- frequency components. By making  $\omega_{c}$  sufficiently large ( $\omega_{c} \gg \omega_{0}$ , e.g., making  $C$  small), a large number of the harmonics can be passed. On the other hand, by making  $\omega_{c}$  sufficiently small ( $\omega_{c} \ll \omega_{0}$ ), we can block out all the ac components and pass only dc, as shown typically in Fig. 17.43(b). (See Fig. 17.2(a) for the Fourier series expansion of the square wave.)

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-14/63c420e9-9220-47ad-935a-09e6b2aeb2a8/cd7316fa138ff0e5ecb3828cb2fef750d02ec5c3b4a3bbf187dfcc1356c5b83e.jpg)  
Figure 17.43(a) Input and output spectra of a low-pass filter, (b) the low-pass filter passes only the dc component when  $\omega_{c} \ll \omega_{0}$ .

Similarly, the output of a bandpass filter depends on the input signal, the transfer function of the filter  $H(\omega)$ , its bandwidth  $B$ , and its center frequency  $\omega_{c}$ . As illustrated in Fig. 17.44(a), the filter passes all the harmonics of the input signal within a band of frequencies  $(\omega_{1} < \omega < \omega_{2})$  centered around  $\omega_{c}$ . We have assumed that  $\omega_{0}$ ,  $2\omega_{0}$ , and  $3\omega_{0}$  are within that band. If the filter is made highly selective  $(B \ll \omega_{0})$  and  $\omega_{c} = \omega_{0}$ , where  $\omega_{0}$  is the fundamental frequency of the input signal, the filter passes only the fundamental component  $(n = 1)$  of the input and blocks out all higher harmonics. As shown in Fig. 17.44(b), with a square wave as input, we obtain a sine wave of the same frequency as the output. (Again, refer to Fig. 17.2(a).)

In this section, we have used  $\omega_{c}$  for the center frequency of the bandpass filter instead of  $\omega_{0}$  as in Chapter 14, to avoid confusing  $\omega_{0}$  with the fundamental frequency of the input signal.

Figure 17.45 For example 17.14.

# Solution:

The input signal in Fig. 17.45(a) is the same as the signal in Fig. 17.9. From Practice Prob. 17.2, we know that the Fourier series expansion is

$$
x(t) = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{\pi} \sin \omega_{0} t - \frac{1}{2\pi} \sin 2\omega_{0} t - \frac{1}{3\pi} \sin 3\omega_{0} t - \dots
$$

where the period is  $T = 1$  s and the fundamental frequency is  $\omega_{0} = 2\pi \mathrm{rad / s}$  . Inasmuch as the corner frequency of the filter is  $\omega_{c} = 10$  rad/s, only the dc component and harmonics with  $n\omega_{0}< 10$  will be passed. For  $n = 2$ $n\omega_{0} = 4\pi = 12.566\mathrm{rad / s}$  , which is higher than  $10\mathrm{rad / s}$  meaning that second and higher harmonics will be rejected. Thus, only the dc and fundamental components will be passed. Hence, the output of the filter is

$$
y(t) = \frac{1}{2} -\frac{1}{\pi}\sin 2\pi t
$$

Rework Example 17.14 if the low- pass filter is replaced by the ideal bandpass filter shown in Fig. 17.46.

Answer:  $y(t) = - \frac{1}{3\pi}\sin 3\omega_{0}t - \frac{1}{4\pi}\sin 4\omega_{0}t - \frac{1}{5\pi}\sin 5\omega_{0}t.$

# 17.9 Summary

1. A periodic function is one that repeats itself every  $T$  seconds; that is,  $f(t\pm n T) = f(t),n = 1,2,3,\ldots$

2. Any nonsinusoidal periodic function  $f(t)$  that we encounter in electrical engineering can be expressed in terms of sinusoids using Fourier series:

$$
f(t) = \underbrace{a_{0} + \sum_{n = 1}^{\infty}\left(a_{n}\cos n\omega_{0}t + b_{n}\sin n\omega_{0}t\right)}_{\mathrm{ac}}
$$

where  $\omega_{0} = 2\pi /T$  is the fundamental frequency. The Fourier series resolves the function into the dc component  $a_{0}$  and an ac component containing infinitely many harmonically related sinusoids. The Fourier coefficients are determined as

$$
\begin{array}{l l}{{a_{0}=\frac{1}{T}\int_{0}^{T}f(t) d t,\qquad a_{n}=\frac{2}{T}\int_{0}^{T}f(t)\cos n\omega_{0}t d t}}\\ {{b_{n}=\frac{2}{T}\int_{0}^{T}f(t)\sin n\omega_{0}t d t}}\end{array}
$$

If  $f(t)$  is an even function,  $b_{n} = 0$  , and when  $f(t)$  is odd,  $a_{0} = 0$  and  $a_{n} = 0$  . If  $f(t)$  is half- wave symmetric,  $a_{0} = a_{n} = b_{n} = 0$  for even values of  $n$

3. An alternative to the trigonometric (or sine-cosine) Fourier series is the amplitude-phase form

$$
f(t) = a_{0} + \sum_{n = 1}^{\infty}A_{n}\cos (n\omega_{0}t + \phi_{n})
$$

where

$$
A_{n} = \sqrt{a_{n}^{2} + b_{n}^{2}},\qquad \phi_{n} = -\tan^{-1}\frac{b_{n}}{a_{n}}
$$

4. Fourier series representation allows us to apply the phasor method in analyzing circuits when the source function is a nonsinusoidal periodic function. We use phasor technique to determine the response of each harmonic in the series, transform the responses to the time domain, and add them up.

5. The average-power of periodic voltage and current is

$$
P = V_{\mathrm{dc}}I_{\mathrm{dc}} + \frac{1}{2}\sum_{n = 1}^{\infty}V_{n}I_{n}\cos (\theta_{n} - \phi_{n})
$$

In other words, the total average power is the sum of the average powers in each harmonically related voltage and current.

6. A periodic function can also be represented in terms of an exponential (or complex) Fourier series as

$$
f(t) = \sum_{n = -\infty}^{\infty}c_ne^{jn\omega_0t}
$$

where

$$
c_{n} = \frac{1}{T}\int_{0}^{T}f(t)e^{-jn\omega_{0}t}dt
$$

and  $\omega_{0} = 2\pi /T$ . The exponential form describes the spectrum of  $f(t)$  in terms of the amplitude and phase of ac components at positive and negative harmonic frequencies. Thus, there are three basic forms of Fourier series representation: the trigonometric form, the amplitude- phase form, and the exponential form.

7. The frequency (or line) spectrum is the plot of  $A_{n}$  and  $\phi_{n}$  or  $|c_{n}|$  and  $\theta_{n}$  versus frequency.

8. The rms value of a periodic function is given by

$$
F_{\mathrm{rms}} = \sqrt{a_0^2 + \frac{1}{2}\sum_{n = 1}^{\infty}A_n^2}
$$

The power dissipated by a  $1 - \Omega$  resistance is

$$
P_{1\Omega} = F_{\mathrm{rms}}^{2} = a_{0}^{2} + \frac{1}{2}\sum_{n = 1}^{\infty}(a_{n}^{2} + b_{n}^{2}) = \sum_{n = 1}^{\infty}|c_{n}|^{2}
$$

This relationship is known as Parseval's theorem.

9. Using PSpice, a Fourier analysis of a circuit can be performed in conjunction with the transient analysis.

10. Fourier series find application in spectrum analyzers and filters. The spectrum analyzer is an instrument that displays the discrete Fourier spectra of an input signal, so that an analyst can determine the frequencies and relative energies of the signal's components. Because the Fourier spectra are discrete spectra, filters can be designed for great effectiveness in blocking frequency components of a signal that are outside a desired range.

# Career in Communications Systems

Communications systems apply the principles of circuit analysis. A communication system is designed to convey information from a source (the transmitter) to a destination (the receiver) via a channel (the propagation medium). Communications engineers design systems for transmitting and receiving information. The information can be in the form of voice, data, or video.

We live in the information age- news, weather, sports, shopping, financial, business inventory, and other sources make information available to us almost instantly via communications systems. Some obvious examples of communications systems are the telephone network, mobile cellular telephones, radio, cable TV, satellite TV, fax, and radar. Mobile radio, used by police and fire departments, aircraft, and various businesses is another example.

The field of communications is perhaps the fastest growing area in electrical engineering. The merging of the communications field with computer technology in recent years has led to digital data communications networks such as local area networks, metropolitan area networks, and broadband integrated services digital networks. For example, the Internet (the "information superhighway") allows educators, business people, and others to send electronic mail from their computers worldwide, log onto remote databases, and transfer files. The Internet has hit the world like a tidal wave and is drastically changing the way people do business, communicate, and get information. This trend will continue.

A communications engineer designs systems that provide high- quality information services. The systems include hardware for generating, transmitting, and receiving information signals. Communications engineers are employed in numerous communications industries and places where communications systems are routinely used. More and more government agencies, academic departments, and businesses are demanding faster and more accurate transmission of information. To meet these needs, communications engineers are in high demand. Therefore, the future is in communications and every electrical engineer must prepare accordingly.

and the Fourier transform.

# 18.1 Introduction

Fourier series enable us to represent a periodic function as a sum of sinusoids and to obtain the frequency spectrum from the series. The Fourier transform allows us to extend the concept of a frequency spectrum to nonperiodic functions. The transform assumes that a nonperiodic function is a periodic function with an infinite period. Thus, the Fourier transform is an integral representation of a nonperiodic function that is analogous to a Fourier series representation of a periodic function.

The Fourier transform is an integral transform like the Laplace transform. It transforms a function in the time domain into the frequency domain. The Fourier transform is very useful in communications systems and digital signal processing, in situations where the Laplace transform does not apply. While the Laplace transform can only handle circuits with inputs for  $t > 0$  with initial conditions, the Fourier transform can handle circuits with inputs for  $t< 0$  as well as those for  $t > 0$

We begin by using a Fourier series as a stepping stone in defining the Fourier transform. Then we develop some of the properties of the Fourier transform. Next, we apply the Fourier transform in analyzing circuits. We discuss Parseval's theorem, compare the Laplace and Fourier transforms, and see how the Fourier transform is applied in amplitude modulation and sampling.

# 18.2 Definition of the Fourier Transform

We saw in the previous chapter that a nonsinusoidal periodic function can be represented by a Fourier series, provided that it satisfies the Dirichlet conditions. What happens if a function is not periodic? Unfortunately, there are many important nonperiodic functions- - such as a unit step or an exponential function- - that we cannot represent by a Fourier series. As we shall see, the Fourier transform allows a transformation from the time to the frequency domain, even if the function is not periodic.

Suppose we want to find the Fourier transform of a nonperiodic function  $p(t)$  , shown in Fig. 18.1(a). We consider a periodic function  $f(t)$  whose shape over one period is the same as  $p(t)$  , as shown in Fig. 18.1(b). If we let the period  $T\rightarrow \infty$  , only a single pulse of width  $\tau$  [the desired nonperiodic function in Fig. 18.1(a)] remains, because the adjacent

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-14/63c420e9-9220-47ad-935a-09e6b2aeb2a8/946b63f6b13b1cb81bf4e1fe97218f79fbb22a97b9125221bbb292c615204825.jpg)  
Figure 18.2 Effect of increasing  $T$  on the spectrum of the periodic pulse trains in Fig. 18.1(b) using the appropriately modified Eq. (17.66).

pulses have been moved to infinity. Thus, the function  $f(t)$  is no longer periodic. In other words,  $f(t) = p(t)$  as  $T \to \infty$ . It is interesting to consider the spectrum of  $f(t)$  for  $A = 10$  and  $\tau = 0.2$  (see Section 17.6). Figure 18.2 shows the effect of increasing  $T$  on the spectrum. First, we notice that the general shape of the spectrum remains the same, and the frequency at which the envelope first becomes zero remains the same. However, the amplitude of the spectrum and the spacing between adjacent components both decrease, while the number of harmonics increases. Thus, over a range of frequencies, the sum of the amplitudes of the harmonics remains almost constant. As the total "strength" or energy of the components within a band must remain unchanged, the amplitudes of the harmonics must decrease as  $T$  increases. Because  $f = 1 / T$ , as  $T$  increases,  $f$  or  $\omega$  decreases, so that the discrete spectrum ultimately becomes continuous.

To further understand this connection between a nonperiodic function and its periodic counterpart, consider the exponential form of a Fourier series in Eq. (17.58), namely,

$$
f(t) = \sum_{n = -\infty}^{\infty}c_{n}e^{jn\omega_{0}t} \tag{18.1}
$$

where

$$
c_{n} = \frac{1}{T}\int_{-T / 2}^{T / 2}f(t)e^{-jn\omega_{0}t}dt \tag{18.2}
$$

The fundamental frequency is

$$
\omega_{0} = \frac{2\pi}{T} \tag{18.3}
$$

and the spacing between adjacent harmonics is

$$
\Delta \omega = (n + 1)\omega_{0} - n\omega_{0} = \omega_{0} = \frac{2\pi}{T} \tag{18.4}
$$

Substituting Eq. (18.2) into Eq. (18.1) gives

$$
\begin{array}{r l} & {f(t) = \sum_{n = -\infty}^{\infty}\left[\frac{1}{T}\int_{-T / 2}^{T / 2}f(t)e^{-j n\omega_{0}t}d t\right]e^{j n\omega_{0}t}}\\ & {\qquad = \sum_{n = -\infty}^{\infty}\left[\frac{\Delta\omega}{2\pi}\int_{-T / 2}^{T / 2}f(t)e^{-j n\omega_{0}t}d t\right]e^{j n\omega_{0}t}}\\ & {\qquad = \frac{1}{2\pi}\sum_{n = -\infty}^{\infty}\left[\int_{-T / 2}^{T / 2}f(t)e^{-j n\omega_{0}t}d t\right]\Delta \omega e^{j n\omega_{0}t}} \end{array} \tag{18.5}
$$

If we let  $T\rightarrow \infty$  , the summation becomes integration, the incremental spacing  $\Delta \omega$  becomes the differential separation  $d\omega$  , and the discrete harmonic frequency  $n\omega_{0}$  becomes a continuous frequency  $\omega$  . Thus, as  $T\rightarrow \infty$

$$
\begin{array}{r l r l}{\sum_{n = -\infty}^{\infty}} & \Rightarrow & {\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}}\\ {\Delta \omega} & \Rightarrow & {d\omega}\\ {n\omega_{0}} & \Rightarrow & \omega \end{array} \tag{18.6}
$$

so that Eq. (18.5) becomes

$$
f(t) = \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\left[\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f(t)e^{-j\omega t}d t\right]e^{j\omega t}d\omega \tag{18.7}
$$

Some authors use  $F(j\omega)$  instead of  $F(\omega)$  to represent the Fourier transform.

The term in the brackets is known as the Fourier transform of  $f(t)$  and is represented by  $F(\omega)$ . Thus,

$$
F(\omega) = \mathcal{F}[f(t)] = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f(t)e^{-j\omega t}d t \tag{18.8}
$$

where  $\mathcal{F}$  is the Fourier transform operator. It is evident from Eq. (18.8) that:

The Fourier transform is an integral transformation of  $f(t)$  from the time domain to the frequency domain.

In general,  $F(\omega)$  is a complex function; its magnitude is called the amplitude spectrum, while its phase is called the phase spectrum. Thus,  $F(\omega)$  is the spectrum.

Equation (18.7) can be written in terms of  $F(\omega)$ , and we obtain the inverse Fourier transform as

$$
f(t) = \mathcal{F}^{-1}[F(\omega)] = \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}F(\omega)e^{j\omega t}d\omega \tag{18.9}
$$

The function  $f(t)$  and its transform  $F(\omega)$  form the Fourier transform pairs:

$$
f(t)\qquad \Leftrightarrow \qquad F(\omega) \tag{18.10}
$$

given that one can be derived from the other.

The Fourier transform  $F(\omega)$  exists when the Fourier integral in Eq. (18.8) converges. A sufficient but not necessary condition that  $f(t)$  has a Fourier transform is that it be completely integrable in the sense that

$$
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}|f(t)|dt< \infty \tag{18.11}
$$

For example, the Fourier transform of the unit ramp function  $u(t)$  does not exist, because the function does not satisfy the condition above.

To avoid the complex algebra that explicitly appears in the Fourier transform, it is sometimes expedient to temporarily replace  $j\omega$  with  $s$  and then replace  $s$  with  $j\omega$  at the end.

Find the Fourier transform of the following functions: (a)  $\delta (t - t_{0})$  (b)  $e^{j\omega_{0}t}$ , (c)  $\cos \omega_{0}t$

# Solution:

(a) For the impulse function,

$$
F(\omega) = \mathcal{F}[\delta (t - t_{0})] = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\delta (t - t_{0})e^{-j\omega t}dt = e^{-j\omega t_{0}} \tag{18.1.1}
$$

where the sifting property of the impulse function in Eq. (7.32) has been applied. For the special case  $t_{0} = 0$ , we obtain

$$
\mathcal{F}[\delta (t)] = 1 \tag{18.1.2}
$$

This shows that the magnitude of the spectrum of the impulse function is constant; that is, all frequencies are equally represented in the impulse function.

(b) We can find the Fourier transform of  $e^{j\omega_{0}t}$  in two ways. If we let

$$
F(\omega) = \delta (\omega -\omega_{0})
$$

then we can find  $f(t)$  using Eq. (18.9), writing

$$
f(t) = \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\delta (\omega -\omega_{0})e^{j\omega t}d\omega
$$

Using the sifting property of the impulse function gives

$$
f(t) = \frac{1}{2\pi} e^{j\omega_{0}t}
$$

Inasmuch as  $F(\omega)$  and  $f(t)$  constitute a Fourier transform pair, so too must  $2\pi \delta (\omega - \omega_{0})$  and  $e^{j\omega_{0}t}$

$$
\mathcal{F}[e^{j\omega_{0}t}] = 2\pi \delta (\omega -\omega_{0}) \tag{18.1.3}
$$

Alternatively, from Eq. (18.1.2),

$$
\delta (t) = \mathcal{F}^{-1}[1]
$$

Using the inverse Fourier transform formula in Eq. (18.9),

$$
\delta (t) = \mathcal{F}^{-1}[1] = \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}1e^{j\omega t}d\omega
$$

or

$$
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}e^{j\omega t}d\omega = 2\pi \delta (t) \tag{18.1.4}
$$

Interchanging variables  $t$  and  $\omega$  results in

$$
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}e^{j\omega t}d t = 2\pi \delta (\omega) \tag{18.1.5}
$$

Using this result, the Fourier transform of the given function is

$$
\mathcal{F}[e^{j\omega_{0}t}] = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}e^{j\omega_{0}t}e^{-j\omega t}d t = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}e^{j(\omega_{0} - \omega)}d t = 2\pi \delta (\omega_{0} - \omega)
$$

Because the impulse function is an even function, with  $\delta (\omega_{0} - \omega) = \delta (\omega - \omega_{0})$

$$
\mathcal{F}[e^{j\omega_{0}t}] = 2\pi \delta (\omega -\omega_{0}) \tag{18.1.6}
$$

By simply changing the sign of  $\omega_{0}$ , we readily obtain

$$
\mathcal{F}[e^{-j\omega_{0}t}] = 2\pi \delta (\omega +\omega_{0}) \tag{18.1.7}
$$

Also, by setting  $\omega_{0} = 0$

$$
\mathcal{F}[1] = 2\pi \delta (\omega) \tag{18.1.8}
$$

(c) By using the result in Eqs. (18.1.6) and (18.1.7), we get

$$
\begin{array}{r l} & {\mathcal{F}[\cos \omega_{0}t] = \mathcal{F}\bigg[\frac{e^{j\omega_{0}t} + e^{-j\omega_{0}t}}{2}\bigg]}\\ & {\qquad = \frac{1}{2}\mathcal{F}[e^{j\omega_{0}t}] + \frac{1}{2}\mathcal{F}[e^{-j\omega_{0}t}]}\\ & {\qquad = \pi \delta (\omega -\omega_{0}) + \pi \delta (\omega +\omega_{0})} \end{array} \tag{18.1.9}
$$

The Fourier transform of the cosine signal is shown in Fig. 18.3.

Answer: (a)  $4(e^{- j\omega} - e^{- j2\omega}) / j\omega$ , (b)  $4e^{j2\omega}$ , (c)  $j10\pi [\delta (\omega +\omega_{0}) - \delta (\omega - \omega_{0})]$ .

Derive the Fourier transform of a single rectangular pulse of width  $\tau$  and height  $A$ , shown in Fig. 18.4.

# Solution:

$$
\begin{array}{l}{{F(\omega)=\int_{-\tau/2}^{\tau/2}A e^{-j\omega t}d t=-\frac{A}{j\omega}e^{-j\omega t}\Big|_{-\tau/2}^{\tau/2}}}\\ {{\quad=\frac{2A}{\omega}\Bigg(\frac{e^{j\omega t/2}-e^{-j\omega t/2}}{2j}\Bigg)}}\\ {{\quad=A t\frac{\sin\omega\tau/2}{\omega\tau/2}=A t\mathrm{sinc}\frac{\omega\tau}{2}}}\end{array}
$$

If we make  $A = 10$  and  $\tau = 2$  as in Fig. 17.27 (like in Section 17.6), then

$$
F(\omega) = 20\sin \omega
$$

whose amplitude spectrum is shown in Fig. 18.5. Comparing Fig. 18.4 with the frequency spectrum of the rectangular pulses in Fig. 17.28, we notice that the spectrum in Fig. 17.28 is discrete and its envelope has the same shape as the Fourier transform of a single rectangular pulse.

$$

# 18.3 Properties of the Fourier Transform

We now develop some properties of the Fourier transform that are useful in finding the transforms of complicated functions from the transforms of simple functions. For each property, we will first state and derive it, and then illustrate it with some examples.

# Linearity

If  $F_{1}(\omega)$  and  $F_{2}(\omega)$  are the Fourier transforms of  $f_{1}(t)$  and  $f_{2}(t)$ , respectively, then

$$
\mathcal{F}[a_{1}f_{1}(t) + a_{2}f_{2}(t)] = a_{1}F_{1}(\omega) + a_{2}F_{2}(\omega) \tag{18.12}
$$

where  $a_{1}$  and  $a_{2}$  are constants. This property simply states that the Fourier transform of a linear combination of functions is the same as the linear combination of the transforms of the individual functions. The proof of the linearity property in Eq. (18.12) is straightforward. By definition,

$$
\begin{array}{l}{\mathcal{F}[a_{1}f_{1}(t) + a_{2}f_{2}(t)] = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}[a_{1}f_{1}(t) + a_{2}f_{2}(t)]e^{-j\omega t}d t}\\ {= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}a_{1}f_{1}(t)e^{-j\omega t}d t + \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}a_{2}f_{2}(t)e^{-j\omega t}d t}\\ {= a_{1}F_{1}(\omega) + a_{2}F_{2}(\omega)} \end{array} \tag{18.13}
$$

For example,  $\sin \omega_{0}t = \frac{1}{2j} (e^{j\omega_{0}t} - e^{- j\omega_{0}t})$ . Using the linearity property,

$$
\begin{array}{l}{{F[\sin\omega_{0}t]=\frac{1}{2j}[\mathcal{F}(e^{j\omega_{0}t})-\mathcal{F}(e^{-j\omega_{0}t})]}}\\ {{=\frac{\pi}{j}[\delta(\omega-\omega_{0})-\delta(\omega+\omega_{0})]}}\\ {{=j\delta[\delta(\omega+\omega_{0})-\delta(\omega-\omega_{0})]}}\end{array} \tag{18.14}
$$

# Time Scaling

If  $F(\omega) = \mathcal{F}[f(t)]$ , then

$$
\mathcal{F}[f(at)] = \frac{1}{|a|} F\left(\frac{\omega}{a}\right) \tag{18.15}
$$

where  $a$  is a constant. Equation (18.15) shows that time expansion  $(|a| > 1)$  corresponds to frequency compression, or conversely, time

compression  $(|a| < 1)$  implies frequency expansion. The proof of the time- scaling property proceeds as follows.

$$
\mathcal{F}[f(at)] = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(at) e^{-j\omega t} dt \tag{18.16}
$$

If we let  $x = at$ , so that  $dx = a dt$ , then

$$
\mathcal{F}[f(at)] = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) e^{-j\omega x / a} \frac{dx}{a} = \frac{1}{a} F\left(\frac{\omega}{a}\right) \tag{18.17}
$$

For example, for the rectangular pulse  $p(t)$  in Example 18.2,

$$
\mathcal{F}[p(t)] = A \tau \sin c \frac{\omega \tau}{2} \tag{18.18a}
$$

Using Eq. (18.15),

$$
\mathcal{F}[p(2t)] = \frac{A \tau}{2} \sin c \frac{\omega \tau}{4} \tag{18.18b}
$$

It may be helpful to plot  $p(t)$  and  $p(2t)$  and their Fourier transforms. Because

$$
p(t) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} A, & -\frac{\tau}{2} < t < \frac{\tau}{2} \\ 0, & \text{otherwise} \end{array} \right. \tag{18.19a}
$$

then replacing every  $t$  with  $2t$  gives

$$
p(2t) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} A, & -\frac{\tau}{2} < 2t < \frac{\tau}{2} \\ 0, & \text{otherwise} \end{array} \right. = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} A, & -\frac{\tau}{4} < t < \frac{\tau}{4} \\ 0, & \text{otherwise} \end{array} \right. \tag{18.19b}
$$

showing that  $p(2t)$  is time compressed, as shown in Fig. 18.9(b). To plot both Fourier transforms in Eq. (18.18), we recall that the sinc function has zeros when its argument is  $n \pi$ , where  $n$  is an integer. Hence, for the transform of  $p(t)$  in Eq. (18.18a),  $\omega \tau /2 = 2\pi f \tau /2 = n \pi \rightarrow f = n / \tau$ , and for the transform of  $p(2t)$  in Eq. (18.18b),  $\omega \tau /4 = 2\pi f \tau /4 = n \pi \rightarrow f = 2n / \tau$ . The plots of the Fourier transforms are shown in Fig. 18.9, which shows that time compression corresponds with frequency expansion. We should expect this intuitively, because when the signal is squashed in time, we expect it to change more rapidly, thereby causing higher- frequency components to exist.

# Time Shifting

If  $F(\omega) = \mathcal{F}[f(t)]$ , then

$$
\mathcal{F}[f(t - t_0)] = e^{-j\omega t_0} F(\omega) \tag{18.20}
$$

that is, a delay in the time domain corresponds to a phase shift in the frequency domain. To derive the time shifting property, we note that

$$
\mathcal{F}[f(t - t_0)] = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(t - t_0) e^{-j\omega t} dt \tag{18.21}
$$

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-14/63c420e9-9220-47ad-935a-09e6b2aeb2a8/763c5362fd5a254cd2e04f92eaf98b4e709ee928755e0dd9f6f7dca2110879b3.jpg)  
Figure 18.9

The effect of time scaling: (a) transform of the pulse, (b) time compression of the pulse causes frequency expansion.

If we let  $x = t - t_{0}$  so that  $dx = dt$  and  $t = x + t_{0}$ , then

$$
\begin{array}{l}{{\mathcal{F}[f(t-t_{0})]=\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}f(x)e^{-j\omega(x+t_{0})}d x}}\\ {{\qquad=e^{-j\omega t_{0}}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f(x)e^{-j\omega x}d x=e^{-j\omega t_{0}}F(\omega)}}\end{array} \tag{18.22}
$$

Similarly,  $\mathcal{F}[f(t + t_{0})] = e^{j\omega t_{0}}F(\omega)$

For example, from Example 18.3,

$$
\mathcal{F}[e^{-at}u(t)] = \frac{1}{a + j\omega} \tag{18.23}
$$

The transform of  $f(t) = e^{-(t - 2)}u(t - 2)$  is

$$
F(u) = \mathcal{F}[e^{-(t - 2)}u(t - 2)] = \frac{e^{-j2\omega}}{1 + j\omega} \tag{18.24}
$$

# Frequency Shifting (or Amplitude Modulation)

This property states that if  $F(\omega) = \mathcal{F}[f(t)]$ , then

$$
\mathcal{F}[f(t)e^{j\omega 0t}] = F(\omega -\omega_{0}) \tag{18.25}
$$

meaning, a frequency shift in the frequency domain adds a phase shift to the time function. By definition,

$$
\begin{array}{l}{{\mathcal{F}[f(t)e^{j\omega t}]=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f(t)e^{j\omega 0t}e^{-j\omega t}d t}}\\ {{=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f(t)e^{-j(\omega-\omega_{0})t}d t=F(\omega-\omega_{0})}}\end{array} \tag{18.26}
$$

For example,  $\cos \omega_{0}t = \frac{1}{2} (e^{j\omega_{0}t} + e^{- j\omega_{0}t})$ . Using the property in Eq. (18.25),

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{\mathcal{F}[f(t)\cos\omega_{0}t]=\frac{1}{2}\mathcal{F}[f(t)e^{j\omega_{0}t}]+\frac{1}{2}\mathcal{F}[f(t)e^{-j\omega_{0}t}]}}\\ {{=\frac{1}{2}F(\omega-\omega_{0})+\frac{1}{2}F(\omega+\omega_{0})}}\end{array} \tag{18.27}
$$

This is an important result in modulation where frequency components of a signal are shifted. If, for example, the amplitude spectrum of  $f(t)$  is as shown in Fig. 18.10(a), then the amplitude spectrum of  $f(t)\cos \omega_{0}t$  will be as shown in Fig. 18.10(b). We will elaborate on amplitude modulation in Section 18.7.1.

Amplitude spectra of: (a) signal  $f(t)$ , (b) modulated signal  $f(t)\cos \omega_{0}t$ .

# Time Differentiation

Given that  $F(\omega) = \mathcal{F}[f(t)]$ , then

$$
\mathcal{F}[f^{\prime}(t)] = j\omega F(\omega) \tag{18.28}
$$

In other words, the transform of the derivative of  $f(t)$  is obtained by multiplying the transform of  $f(t)$  by  $j\omega$ . By definition,

$$
f(t) = \mathcal{F}^{-1}[F(\omega)] = \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}F(\omega)e^{j\omega t}d\omega \tag{18.29}
$$

Taking the derivative of both sides with respect to  $t$  gives

$$
f^{\prime}(t) = \frac{j\omega}{2\pi}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}F(\omega)e^{j\omega t}d\omega = j\omega \mathcal{F}^{-1}[F(\omega)]
$$

or

$$
\mathcal{F}[f^{\prime}(t)] = j\omega F(\omega) \tag{18.30}
$$

Repeated applications of Eq. (18.30) give

$$
\mathcal{F}[f^{(n)}(t)] = (j\omega)^{n}F(\omega) \tag{18.31}
$$

For example, if  $f(t) = e^{- a t}u(t)$  , then

$$
f^{\prime}(t) = -a e^{-a t}u(t) + e^{-a t}\delta (t) = -a f(t) + e^{-a t}\delta (t) \tag{18.32}
$$

Taking the Fourier transforms of the first and last terms, we obtain

$$
j\omega F(\omega) = -a F(\omega) + 1\qquad \Rightarrow \qquad F(\omega) = \frac{1}{a + j\omega} \tag{18.33}
$$

which agrees with the result in Example 18.3.

# Time Integration

Given that  $F(\omega) = \mathcal{F}[f(t)]$  , then

$$
\mathcal{F}\Big[\int_{-\infty}^{t}f(\tau) d\tau \Big] = \frac{F(\omega)}{j\omega} +\pi F(0)\delta (\omega) \tag{18.34}
$$

that is, the transform of the integral of  $f(t)$  is obtained by dividing the transform of  $f(t)$  by  $j\omega$  and adding the result to the impulse term that reflects the dc component  $F(0)$  . Someone might ask, “How do we know that when we take the Fourier transform for time integration, we should integrate over the interval  $[- \infty , t]$  and not  $[- \infty , \infty ]$  ?” When we integrate over  $[- \infty , \infty ]$  , the result does not depend on time anymore, and the Fourier transform of a constant is what we will eventually get. But when we integrate over  $[- \infty , t]$  , we get the integral of the function from the past to time  $t$  , so that the result depends on  $t$  and we can take the Fourier transform of that.

If  $\omega$  is replaced by 0 in Eq. (18.8),

$$
F(0) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f(t) d t \tag{18.35}
$$

indicating that the dc component is zero when the integral of  $f(t)$  over all time vanishes. The proof of the time integration in Eq. (18.34) will be given later when we consider the convolution property.

For example, we know that  $\mathcal{F}[\delta (t)] = 1$  and that integrating the impulse function gives the unit step function [see Eq. (7.39a)]. By applying the property in Eq. (18.34), we obtain the Fourier transform of the unit step function as

$$
\mathcal{F}[u(t)] = \mathcal{F}\Big[\int_{-\infty}^{t}\delta (\tau) d\tau \Big] = \frac{1}{j\omega} +\pi \delta (\omega) \tag{18.36}
$$

# Reversal

If  $F(\omega) = \mathcal{F}[f(t)]$  , then

$$
\mathcal{F}[f(-t)] = F(-\omega) = F^{*}(\omega) \tag{18.37}
$$

where the asterisk denotes the complex conjugate. This property states that reversing  $f(t)$  about the time axis reverses  $F(\omega)$  about the frequency axis. This may be regarded as a special case of time scaling for which  $a = - 1$  in Eq. (18.15).

For example,  $1 = u(t) + u(- t)$ . Hence,

$$
\begin{array}{l}{\mathcal{F}[1] = \mathcal{F}[u(t)] + \mathcal{F}[u(-t)]}\\ {= \frac{1}{j\omega} +\pi \delta (\omega)}\\ {\quad -\frac{1}{j\omega} +\pi \delta (-\omega)}\\ {= 2\pi \delta (\omega)} \end{array}
$$

# Duality

This property states that if  $F(\omega)$  is the Fourier transform of  $f(t)$ , then the Fourier transform of  $F(t)$  is  $2\pi f(- \omega)$ ; we write

$$
\mathcal{F}[f(t)] = F(\omega) \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad \mathcal{F}[F(t)] = 2\pi f(-\omega) \tag{18.38}
$$

This expresses the symmetry property of the Fourier transform. To derive this property, we recall that

$$
f(t) = \mathcal{F}^{-1}[F(\omega)] = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} F(\omega) e^{j\omega t} d\omega
$$

or

$$
2\pi f(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} F(\omega) e^{j\omega t} d\omega \tag{18.39}
$$

Replacing  $t$  by  $- t$  gives

$$
2\pi f(-t) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} F(\omega) e^{-j\omega t} d\omega
$$

If we interchange  $t$  and  $\omega$ , we obtain

$$
2\pi f(-\omega) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} F(t) e^{-j\omega t} d t = \mathcal{F}[F(t)] \tag{18.40}
$$

as expected.

For example, if  $f(t) = e^{- |t|}$ , then

$$
F(\omega) = \frac{2}{\omega^2 + 1} \tag{18.41}
$$

By the duality property, the Fourier transform of  $F(t) = 2 / (t^2 + 1)$  is

$$
2\pi f(\omega) = 2\pi e^{-|t|} \tag{18.42}
$$

Figure 18.11 shows another example of the duality property. It illustrates the fact that if  $f(t) = \delta (t)$  so that  $F(\omega) = 1$ , as in Fig. 18.11(a), then the Fourier transform of  $F(t) = 1$  is  $2\pi f(\omega) = 2\pi \delta (\omega)$  as shown in Fig. 18.11(b).

# Convolution

Recall from Chapter 15 that if  $x(t)$  is the input excitation to a circuit with an impulse function of  $h(t)$ , then the output response  $y(t)$  is given by the convolution integral

$$
y(t) = h(t) * x(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} h(\lambda) x(t - \lambda) d\lambda \tag{18.43}
$$

Because  $f(t)$  is the sum of the signals in Figs. 18.7 and 18.8,  $F(\omega)$  is the sum of the results in Example 18.3 and Practice Prob. 18.3.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-14/63c420e9-9220-47ad-935a-09e6b2aeb2a8/80a600081062a30b4131150e932a17cb09e0c218fca21694b623909ec4dce1ff.jpg)  
Figure 18.11 A typical illustration of the duality property of the Fourier transform: (a) transform of impulse, (b) transform of unit dc level.

If  $X(\omega), H(\omega)$ , and  $Y(\omega)$  are the Fourier transforms of  $x(t), h(t)$ , and  $y(t)$ , respectively, then

$$
Y(\omega) = \mathcal{F}[h(t) * x(t)] = H(\omega) X(\omega) \tag{18.44}
$$

which indicates that convolution in the time domain corresponds with multiplication in the frequency domain.

To derive the convolution property, we take the Fourier transform of both sides of Eq. (18.43) to get

$$
Y(\omega) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} h(\lambda) x(t - \lambda) d\lambda \int_{-\infty}^{j\omega t} dt \tag{18.45}
$$

Exchanging the order of integration and factoring  $h(\lambda)$ , which does not depend on  $t$ , we have

$$
Y(\omega) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} h(\lambda) \left[ \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x(t - \lambda) e^{-j\omega t} dt \right] d\lambda
$$

For the integral within the brackets, let  $\tau = t - \lambda$  so that  $t = \tau + \lambda$  and  $dt = d\tau$ . Then,

$$
\begin{array}{l}{{ Y(\omega)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}h(\lambda)\left[\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}x(\tau)e^{-j\omega(\tau+\lambda)}d\tau\right]d\lambda}}\\ {{\quad=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}h(\lambda)e^{-j\omega\lambda}d\lambda\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}x(\tau)e^{-j\omega\tau}d\tau=H(\omega)X(\omega)}}\end{array} \tag{18.46}
$$

The important relationship in Eq. (18.46) is the key reason for using the Fourier transform in the analysis of linear systems.

as expected. This result expands the phasor method beyond what was done with the Fourier series in the previous chapter.

To illustrate the convolution property, suppose both  $h(t)$  and  $x(t)$  are identical rectangular pulses, as shown in Fig. 18.12(a) and 18.12(b). We recall from Example 18.2 and Fig. 18.5 that the Fourier transforms of the rectangular pulses are sinc functions, as shown in Fig. 18.12(c) and 18.12(d). According to the convolution property, the product of the sinc functions should give us the convolution of the rectangular pulses in the time domain. Thus, the convolution of the pulses in Fig. 18.12(e) and the product of the sinc functions in Fig. 18.12(f) form a Fourier pair.

In view of the duality property, we expect that if convolution in the time domain corresponds with multiplication in the frequency domain,

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-14/63c420e9-9220-47ad-935a-09e6b2aeb2a8/09a01a7e64fba359ab93762f60dad697a5fb6b8dfe4748d4196114142a64e895.jpg)  
Figure 18.12 Graphical illustration of the convolution property. Source: Brigham, E. Oran. The Fast Fourier Transform. Pearson Education, Inc., Upper Saddle River, NJ, 1974.

then multiplication in the time domain should have a correspondence in the frequency domain. This happens to be the case. If  $f(t) = f_{1}(t) f_{2}(t)$ , then

$$
F(\omega) = \mathcal{F}[f_{1}(t) f_{2}(t)] = \frac{1}{2\pi} F_{1}(\omega) * F_{2}(\omega) \tag{18.47}
$$

or

$$
F(\omega) = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} F_{1}(\lambda) F_{2}(\omega - \lambda) d\lambda \tag{18.48}
$$

which is convolution in the frequency domain. The proof of Eq. (18.48) readily follows from the duality property in Eq. (18.38).

Let us now derive the time integration property in Eq. (18.34). If we replace  $x(t)$  with the unit step function  $u(t)$  and  $h(t)$  with  $f(t)$  in Eq. (18.43), then

$$
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f(\lambda)u(t - \lambda)d\lambda = f(t)*u(t) \tag{18.49}
$$

But by the definition of the unit step function,

$$
u(t - \lambda) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}1, & t - \lambda >0 \\ 0, & t - \lambda >0 \end{array} \right.
$$

We can write this as

$$
u(t - \lambda) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}1, & \lambda < t \\ 0, & \lambda >t \end{array} \right.
$$

Substituting this into Eq. (18.49) makes the interval of integration change from  $[- \infty , \infty ]$  to  $[- \infty , t]$ , and thus Eq. (18.49) becomes

$$
\int_{-\infty}^{t}f(\lambda)d\lambda = u(t)*f(t)
$$

Taking the Fourier transform of both sides yields

$$
\mathcal{F}\left[\int_{-\infty}^{t}f(\lambda)d\lambda \right] = U(\omega)F(\omega) \tag{18.50}
$$

But from Eq. (18.36), the Fourier transform of the unit step function is

$$
U(\omega) = \frac{1}{j\omega} + \pi \delta (\omega)
$$

Substituting this into Eq. (18.50) gives

$$
\begin{array}{r l r} & {} & {\mathcal{F}\bigg[\int_{-\infty}^{t}f(\lambda)d\lambda \bigg] = \bigg(\frac{1}{j\omega} +\pi \delta (\omega)\bigg)F(\omega)}\\ & {} & \\ & {} & {= \frac{F(\omega)}{j\omega} +\pi F(0)\delta (\omega)} \end{array} \tag{18.51}
$$

(18.51)

which is the time integration property of Eq. (18.34). Note that in Eq. (18.51),  $F(\omega)\delta (\omega) = F(0)\delta (\omega)$ , since  $\delta (\omega)$  is only nonzero at  $\omega = 0$ .

Table 18.1 lists these properties of the Fourier transform. Table 18.2 presents the transform pairs of some common functions. Note the similarities between these tables and Tables 15.1 and 15.2.

Figure 18.13 The signum function of Example 18.4.

Find the Fourier transforms of the following functions: (a) signum function  $\operatorname {sgn}(t)$ , shown in Fig. 18.13, (b) the double- sided exponential  $e^{- a|t|}$ , and (c) the sinc function  $(\sin t) / t$ .

# Solution:

(a) We can obtain the Fourier transform of the signum function in three ways.

■ METHOD 1 We can write the signum function in terms of the unit step function as

$$
\operatorname {sgn}(t) = f(t) = u(t) - u(-t)
$$

But from Eq. (18.36),

$$
U(\omega) = \mathcal{F}[u(t)] = \pi \delta (\omega) + \frac{1}{j\omega}
$$

Applying this and the reversal property, we obtain

$$
\begin{array}{l}{{\mathcal{F}[\mathrm{sgn}(t)]=U(\omega)-U(-\omega)}}\\ {{=\left(\pi\delta(\omega)+\frac{1}{j\omega}\right)-\left(\pi\delta(-\omega)+\frac{1}{-j\omega}\right)=\frac{2}{j\omega}}}\end{array}
$$

■ METHOD 2 Because  $\delta (\omega) = \delta (- \omega)$ , another way of writing the signum function in terms of the unit step function is

$$
f(t) = \operatorname {sgn}(t) = -1 + 2u(t)
$$

Taking the Fourier transform of each term gives

$$
F(\omega) = -2\pi \delta (\omega) + 2\left(\pi \delta (\omega) + \frac{1}{j\omega}\right) = \frac{2}{j\omega}
$$

■ METHOD 3 We can take the derivative of the signum function in Fig. 18.13 and obtain

$$
f^{\prime}(t) = 2\delta (t)
$$

Taking the transform of this,

$$
j\omega F(\omega) = 2\qquad \Rightarrow \qquad F(\omega) = \frac{2}{j\omega}
$$

as obtained previously.

(b) The double-sided exponential can be expressed as

$$
f(t) = e^{-a|t|} = e^{-a t}u(t) + e^{a t}u(-t) = y(t) + y(-t)
$$

where  $y(t) = e^{- a t}u(t)$  so that  $Y(\omega) = 1 / (a + j\omega)$ . Applying the reversal property,

$$
\mathcal{F}[e^{-a|t|}] = Y(\omega) + Y(-\omega) = \left(\frac{1}{a + j\omega} +\frac{1}{a - j\omega}\right) = \frac{2a}{a^{2} + \omega^{2}}
$$

(c) From Example 18.2,

$$
\mathcal{F}\left[u\left(t + \frac{\tau}{2}\right) - u\left(t - \frac{\tau}{2}\right)\right] = \tau \frac{\sin(\omega\tau / 2)}{\omega\tau / 2} = \tau \operatorname {sinc}\frac{\omega\tau}{2}
$$

Setting  $\tau /2 = 1$  gives

$$
\mathcal{F}[u(t + 1) - u(t - 1)] = 2\frac{\sin\omega}{\omega}
$$

Applying the duality property yields

$$
\mathcal{F}\left[2\frac{\sin t}{t}\right] = 2\pi [U(\omega +1) - U(\omega -1)]
$$

or

$$
\mathcal{F}\left[\frac{\sin t}{t}\right] = \pi [U(\omega +1) - U(\omega -1)]
$$

Determine the Fourier transforms of these functions: (a) gate function  $g(t) = u(t) - u(t - 1)$ , (b)  $f(t) = t e^{- 2t}u(t)$ , and (c) sawtooth pulse  $p(t) = 50t[u(t) - u(t - 2)]$ .

Answer: (a)  $(1 - e^{- j\omega})\left[\pi \delta (\omega) + \frac{1}{j\omega}\right]$ , (b)  $\frac{1}{(2 + j\omega)^2}$ , (c)  $\frac{50(e^{- j2\omega} - 1)}{\omega^2} +\frac{100j}{\omega} e^{- j2\omega}$ .

Find the Fourier transform of the function in Fig. 18.14.

# Solution:

The Fourier transform can be found directly using Eq. (18.8), but it is much easier to find it using the derivative property. We can express the function as

$$
f(t) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}1 + t, & -1 < t < 0 \\ 1 - t, & 0 < t < 1 \end{array} \right.
$$

Its first derivative is shown in Fig. 18.15(a) and is given by

$$
f^{\prime}(t) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}1, & -1 < t < 0 \\ -1, & 0 < t < 1 \end{array} \right.
$$

$$

Figure 18.16 For Practice Prob. 18.5.

Determine the Fourier transform of the function in Fig. 18.16.

Answer:  $(20\cos 3\omega - 10\cos 4\omega - 10\cos 2\omega) / \omega^{2}$ .

# Example 18.6

Obtain the inverse Fourier transform of:

(a)  $F(\omega) = \frac{10j\omega + 4}{(j\omega)^{2} + 6j\omega + 8}$  
(b)  $G(\omega) = \frac{\omega^{2} + 21}{\omega^{2} + 9}$

# Solution:

(a) To avoid complex algebra, we can replace  $j\omega$  with  $s$  for the moment. Using partial fraction expansion,

$$
F(s) = \frac{10s + 4}{s^{2} + 6s + 8} = \frac{10s + 4}{(s + 4)(s + 2)} = \frac{A}{s + 4} +\frac{B}{s + 2}
$$

where

$$
\begin{array}{l}{{A=(s+4)F(s){\big|}_{s=-4}={\frac{10s+4}{(s+2)}}{\bigg|}_{s=-4}={\frac{-36}{-2}}=18}}\\ {{B=(s+2)F(s){\big|}_{s=-2}={\frac{10s+4}{(s+4)}}{\bigg|}_{s=-2}={\frac{-16}{2}}=-8}}\end{array}
$$

Substituting  $A = 18$  and  $B = - 8$  in  $F(s)$  and  $s$  with  $j\omega$  gives

$$
F(j\omega) = \frac{18}{j\omega + 4} +\frac{-8}{j\omega + 2}
$$

With the aid of Table 18.2, we obtain the inverse transform as

$$
f(t) = (18e^{-4t} - 8e^{-2t})u(t)
$$

(b) We simplify  $G(\omega)$  as

$$
G(\omega) = \frac{\omega^{2} + 21}{\omega^{2} + 9} = 1 + \frac{12}{\omega^{2} + 9}
$$

With the aid of Table 18.2, the inverse transform is obtained as

$$
g(t) = \delta (t) + 2e^{-3|t|}
$$

Find the inverse Fourier transform of:

$$
\begin{array}{l}{{\mathrm{~a~})~}H(\omega)=\frac{6(3+j2\omega)}{(1+j\omega)(4+j\omega)(2+j\omega)}}\\ {{\mathrm{~b~})~}Y(\omega)=\pi\delta(\omega)+\frac{1}{j\omega}+\frac{2(1+j\omega)}{(1+j\omega)^{2}+16}}\end{array}
$$

Answer: (a)  $h(t) = (2e^{- t} + 3e^{- 2t} - 5e^{- 4t})u(t)$ ,

(b)  $y(t) = (1 + 2e^{-t}\cos 4t)u(t)$ .

# 18.4 Circuit Applications

The Fourier transform generalizes the phasor technique to nonperiodic functions. Therefore, we apply Fourier transforms to circuits with non- sinusoidal excitations in exactly the same way we apply phasor techniques to circuits with sinusoidal excitations. Thus, Ohm's law is still valid:

$$
V(\omega) = Z(\omega)I(\omega) \tag{18.52}
$$

where  $V(\omega)$  and  $I(\omega)$  are the Fourier transforms of the voltage and current and  $Z(\omega)$  is the impedance. We get the same expressions for the impedances of resistors, inductors, and capacitors as in phasor analysis, namely,

$$
\begin{array}{r l r l r l}{{R}}&{{}}&{\Rightarrow}&{{}}&{R}\\ {L}&{{}}&{\Rightarrow}&{{}}&{j\omega L}\\ {C}&{{}}&{\Rightarrow}&{{}}&{\frac{1}{j\omega C}}\end{array} \tag{18.53}
$$

Once we transform the functions for the circuit elements into the frequency domain and take the Fourier transforms of the excitations, we can use circuit techniques such as voltage division, source transformation, mesh analysis, node analysis, or Thevenin's theorem, to find the unknown response (current or voltage). Finally, we take the inverse Fourier transform to obtain the response in the time domain.

Although the Fourier transform method produces a response that exists for  $- \infty < t< \infty$ , Fourier analysis cannot handle circuits with initial conditions.

The transfer function is again defined as the ratio of the output response  $Y(\omega)$  to the input excitation  $X(\omega)$ ; that is,

$$
H(\omega) = \frac{Y(\omega)}{X(\omega)} \tag{18.54}
$$

or

Figure 18.17 Input-output relationship of a circuit in the frequency domain.

$$
Y(\omega) = H(\omega)X(\omega) \tag{18.55}
$$

The frequency domain input- output relationship is portrayed in Fig. 18.17. Equation (18.55) shows that if we know the transfer function and the input, we can readily find the output. The relationship in Eq. (18.54) is the principal reason for using the Fourier transform in circuit analysis. Notice that  $H(\omega)$  is identical to  $H(s)$  with  $s = j\omega$ . Also, if the input is an impulse function [i.e.,  $x(t) = \delta (t)$ ], then  $X(\omega) = 1$ , so that the response is

$$
Y(\omega) = H(\omega) = \mathcal{F}[h(t)] \tag{18.56}
$$

indicating that  $H(\omega)$  is the Fourier transform of the impulse response  $h(t)$ .

Figure 18.18 For Example 18.7.

Find  $\nu_{o}(t)$  in the circuit of Fig. 18.18 for  $\nu_{i}(t) = 2e^{- 3t}u(t)$ .

# Solution:

The Fourier transform of the input voltage is

$$
V_{i}(\omega) = \frac{2}{3 + j\omega}
$$

and the transfer function obtained by voltage division is

$$
H(\omega) = \frac{V_{o}(\omega)}{V_{i}(\omega)} = \frac{1 / j\omega}{2 + 1 / j\omega} = \frac{1}{1 + j2\omega}
$$

Hence,

$$
V_{o}(\omega) = V_{i}(\omega)H(\omega) = \frac{2}{(3 + j\omega)(1 + j2\omega)}
$$

or

$$
V_{o}(\omega) = \frac{1}{(3 + j\omega)(0.5 + j\omega)}
$$

By partial fractions,

$$
V_{o}(\omega) = \frac{-0.4}{3 + j\omega} +\frac{0.4}{0.5 + j\omega}
$$

Taking the inverse Fourier transform yields

$$
\nu_{o}(t) = 0.4(e^{-0.5t} - e^{-3t})u(t)

Determine  $\nu_{o}(t)$  in Fig. 18.19 if  $\nu_{i}(t) = 5\mathrm{sgn}(t) = (- 5 + 10u(t))$  V.

Answer:  $- 5 + 10(1 - e^{- 4t})u(t)$  V.

Using the Fourier transform method, find  $i_{o}(t)$  in Fig. 18.20 when  $i_{s}(t) = 10 \sin 2t$  A.

# Solution:

By current division,

$$
H_{o}(\omega) = \frac{I_{o}(\omega)}{I_{s}(\omega)} = \frac{2}{2 + 4 + 2 / j\omega} = \frac{j\omega}{1 + j\omega3}
$$

If  $i_{s}(t) = 10 \sin 2t$ , then

$$
I_{s}(\omega) = j\pi 10[\delta (\omega +2) - \delta (\omega -2)]
$$

Hence,

$$
I_{s}(\omega) = H(\omega)I_{s}(\omega) = \frac{10\pi\omega[\delta(\omega - 2) - \delta(\omega + 2)]}{1 + j\omega3}
$$

The inverse Fourier transform of  $I_{o}(\omega)$  cannot be found using Table 18.2. We resort to the inverse Fourier transform formula in Eq. (18.9) and write

$$
i_{o}(t) = \mathcal{F}^{-1}[I_{o}(\omega)] = \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{10\pi\omega[\delta(\omega - 2) - \delta(\omega + 2)]}{1 + j\omega3} e^{j\omega t}d\omega
$$

We apply the sifting property of the impulse function, namely,

$$
\delta (\omega -\omega_{0})f(\omega) = f(\omega_{0})
$$

or

$$
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\delta (\omega -\omega_{0})f(\omega) d\omega = f(\omega_{0})
$$

and obtain

$$
\begin{array}{l}{{i_{o}(t)=\frac{10\pi}{2\pi}\bigg[\frac{2}{1+j6}e^{j2t}-\frac{-2}{1-j6}e^{-j2t}\bigg]}}\\ {{\mathrm{}=10\left[\frac{e^{j2t}}{6.082e^{j80.54^{\circ}}}+\frac{e^{-j2t}}{6.082e^{-j80.54^{\circ}}}\right]}}\\ {{\mathrm{}=1.644[e^{i(2t-80.54^{\circ})}+e^{-j(2t-80.54^{\circ})}]}}\\ {{\mathrm{}=3.288\cos(2t-80.54^{\circ})\mathrm{~A~}}}\end{array}
$$

Find the current  $i_{o}(t)$  in the circuit in Fig. 18.21, given that  $i_{s}(t) = 20 \cos 4t$  A.

Answer: 11.18 cos  $(4t + 26.57^{\circ})$  A.

# 18.5 Parseval's Theorem

Parseval's theorem demonstrates one practical use of the Fourier transform. It relates the energy carried by a signal to the Fourier transform of the signal. If  $p(t)$  is the power associated with the signal, the energy carried by the signal is

$$
W = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}p(t) d t \tag{18.57}
$$

To be able to compare the energy content of current and voltage signals, it is convenient to use a  $1 - \Omega$  resistor as the base for energy calculation. For a  $1 - \Omega$  resistor,  $p(t) = \nu^{2}(t) = \dot{t}^{2}(t) = f^{2}(t)$  , where  $f(t)$  stands for either voltage or current. The energy delivered to the  $1 - \Omega$  resistor is

$$
W_{1\Omega} = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f^{2}(t) d t \tag{18.58}
$$

Parseval's theorem states that this same energy can be calculated in the frequency domain as

$$
W_{1\Omega} = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f^{2}(t) d t = \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}|F(\omega)|^{2} d\omega \tag{18.59}
$$

Parseval's theorem states that the total energy delivered to a  $1 - \Omega$  resistor equals the total area under the square of  $f(t)$  or  $1 / 2\pi$  times the total area under the square of the magnitude of the Fourier transform of  $f(t)$

In fact,  $|F(\omega)|^{2}$  is sometimes known as the energy spectral density of signal  $f(t)$

Parseval's theorem relates energy associated with a signal to its Fourier transform. It provides the physical significance of  $F(\omega)$  , namely, that  $|F(\omega)|^{2}$  is a measure of the energy density (in joules per hertz) corresponding to  $f(t)$

To derive Eq. (18.59), we begin with Eq. (18.58) and substitute Eq. (18.9) for one of the  $f(t)$  's. We obtain

$$
W_{1\Omega} = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f^{2}(t) d t = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f(t)\left[\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}F(\omega)e^{j\omega t} d\omega \right]d t \tag{18.60}
$$

The function  $f(t)$  can be moved inside the integral within the brackets, since the integral does not involve time:

$$
W_{1\Omega} = \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f(t)F(\omega)e^{j\omega t}d\omega d\omega \tag{18.61}
$$

Reversing the order of integration,

$$
\begin{array}{l}{{ W_{1\Omega}=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}F(\omega)\left[\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f(t)e^{-j(-\omega)t}d t\right]d\omega}}\\ {{\quad=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}F(\omega)F(-\omega) d\omega=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}F(\omega)F^{*}(\omega) d\omega}}\end{array} \tag{18.62}
$$

But if  $z = x + j y$ $z z^{*} = (x + j y)(x - j y) = x^{2} + y^{2} = |z|^{2}$  . Hence,

$$
W_{1\Omega} = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f^{2}(t) d t = \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}|F(\omega)|^{2} d\omega
$$

as expected. Equation (18.63) indicates that the energy carried by a signal can be found by integrating either the square of  $f(t)$  in the time domain or  $1 / 2\pi$  times the square of  $F(\omega)$  in the frequency domain.

Because  $|F(\omega)|^{2}$  is an even function, we may integrate from O to  $\infty$  and double the result; that is,

$$
W_{1\Omega} = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f^{2}(t) d t = \frac{1}{\pi}\int_{0}^{\infty}|F(\omega)|^{2} d\omega
$$

We may also calculate the energy in any frequency band  $\omega_{1}< \omega < \omega_{2}$  as

$$
W_{1\Omega} = \frac{1}{\pi}\int_{\omega_{1}}^{\omega_{2}}|F(\omega)|^{2} d\omega
$$

Notice that Parseval's theorem as stated here applies to nonperiodic functions. Parseval's theorem for periodic functions was presented in Sections 17.5 and 17.6. As evident in Eq. (18.63), Parseval's theorem shows that the energy associated with a nonperiodic signal is spread over the entire frequency spectrum, whereas the energy of a periodic signal is concentrated at the frequencies of its harmonic components.

The voltage across a 10-  resistor is  $\nu (t) = 5e^{- 3t}u(t)$  V. Find the total energy dissipated in the resistor.

# Solution:

1. Define. The problem is well defined and clearly stated.

2. Present. We are given the voltage across the resistor for all time and are asked to find the energy dissipated by the resistor. We note that the voltage is zero for all time less than zero. Thus, we only need to consider the time from zero to infinity.

3. Alternative. There are basically two ways to find this answer. The first would be to find the answer in the time domain. We will use the second approach to find the answer using Fourier analysis.

4. Attempt. In the time domain,

$$
\begin{array}{l}{{W_{10\Omega}=0.1\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f^{2}(t) d t=0.1\int_{0}^{\infty}25e^{-6t}d t}}\\ {{\mathrm{}=2.5\frac{e^{-6t}}{-6}\Big|_{0}^{\infty}=\frac{2.5}{6}=416.7 \mathrm{mJ}}}\end{array}
$$

5. Evaluate. In the frequency domain,

$$
F(\omega) = V(\omega) = \frac{5}{3 + j\omega}
$$

so that

$$
|F(\omega)|^{2} = F(\omega)F(\omega)^{*} = \frac{25}{9 + \omega^{2}}
$$

Hence, the energy dissipated is

$$
\begin{array}{l}{{ W_{10\Omega}=\frac{0.1}{2\pi}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}|F(\omega)|^{2}d\omega=\frac{0.1}{\pi}\int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{25}{9+\omega^{2}}d\omega}}\\ {{\quad=\frac{2.5}{\pi}\left(\frac{1}{3}\tan^{-1}\frac{\omega}{3}\right)\Big|_{0}^{\infty}=\frac{2.5}{\pi}\Big(\frac{1}{3}\Big)\Big(\frac{\pi}{2}\Big)=\frac{2.5}{6}=416.7 \mathrm{mJ}}}\end{array}
$$

6. Satisfactory? We have satisfactorily solved the problem and can present the results as a solution to the problem.

(a) Calculate the total energy absorbed by a  $1 - \Omega$  resistor with  $i(t) = 10e^{-2|t|}$  A in the time domain. 
(b) Repeat 
(a) in the frequency domain.

Answer: (a) 50 J, (b) 50 J.

# Example 18.10

Calculate the fraction of the total energy dissipated by a  $1 - \Omega$  resistor in the frequency band  $- 10< \omega < 10$  rad/s when the voltage across it is  $\nu (t) = e^{- 2t}u(t)$

# Solution:

Given that  $f(t) = \nu (t) = e^{- 2t}u(t)$ , then

$$
F(\omega) = \frac{1}{2 + j\omega} \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad |F(\omega)|^{2} = \frac{1}{4 + \omega^{2}}
$$

The total energy dissipated by the resistor is

$$
\begin{array}{l}{{ W_{1\Omega}=\frac{1}{\pi}\int_{0}^{\infty}|F(\omega)|^{2}d\omega=\frac{1}{\pi}\int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{d\omega}{4+\omega^{2}}}}\\ {{\quad=\frac{1}{\pi}\bigg(\frac{1}{2}\mathrm{tan}^{-1}\frac{\omega}{2}\bigg|_{0}^{\infty}\bigg)=\frac{1}{\pi}\bigg(\frac{1}{2}\bigg)\frac{\pi}{2}=0.25\mathrm{~J}}}\end{array}
$$

The energy in the frequencies  $- 10< \omega < 10$  rad/s is

$$
\begin{array}{l}{{ W=\frac{1}{\pi}\int_{0}^{10}|F(\omega)|^{2}d\omega=\frac{1}{\pi}\int_{0}^{10}\frac{d\omega}{4+\omega^{2}}=\frac{1}{\pi}\bigg(\frac{1}{2}\tan^{1}\frac{\omega}{2}\bigg|_{0}^{10}\bigg)}}\\ {{\quad=\frac{1}{2\pi}\tan^{-1}5=\frac{1}{2\pi}\bigg(\frac{78.69^{\circ}}{180^{\circ}}\pi\bigg)=0.218\mathrm{~J}}}\end{array}
$$

Its percentage of the total energy is

$$
\frac{W}{W_{1\Omega}} = \frac{0.218}{0.25} = 87.4 \text{percent}
$$

A  $2 - \Omega$  resistor has  $i(t) = 2e^{- t}u(t)$  A. What percentage of the total energy is in the frequency band  $- 4 < \omega < 4 \text{rad / s}$ ?

Answer: 84.4 percent.

# 18.6 Comparing the Fourier and Laplace Transforms

It is worthwhile to take some moments to compare the Laplace and Fourier transforms. The following similarities and differences should be noted:

1. The Laplace transform defined in Chapter 15 is one-sided in that the integral is over  $0 < t < \infty$ , making it only useful for positive-time functions,  $f(t)$ ,  $t > 0$ . The Fourier transform is applicable to functions defined for all time.

2. For a function  $f(t)$  that is nonzero for positive time only (i.e.,

$f(t) = 0, t < 0)$  and  $\int_{0}^{\infty} |f(t)| dt < \infty$ , the two transforms are related by

$$
F(\omega) = F(s)\big|_{s = j\omega} \tag{18.66}
$$

This equation also shows that the Fourier transform can be regarded as a special case of the Laplace transform with  $s = j\omega$ . Recall that  $s = \sigma + j\omega$ . Therefore, Eq. (18.66) shows that the Laplace transform is related to the entire  $s$  plane, whereas the Fourier transform is restricted to the  $j\omega$  axis. See Fig. 15.1.

3. The Laplace transform is applicable to a wider range of functions than the Fourier transform. For example, the function  $tu(t)$  has a Laplace transform but no Fourier transform. But Fourier transforms exist for signals that are not physically realizable and have no Laplace transforms.

4. The Laplace transform is better suited for the analysis of transient problems involving initial conditions, because it permits the inclusion of the initial conditions, whereas the Fourier transform does not. The Fourier transform is especially useful for problems in the steady state.

5. The Fourier transform provides greater insight into the frequency characteristics of signals than does the Laplace transform.

Some of the similarities and differences can be observed by comparing Tables 15.1 and 15.2 with Tables 18.1 and 18.2.

In other words, if all the poles of  $F(s)$  lie in the left- hand side of the  $s$  plane, then one can obtain the Fourier transform  $F(\omega)$  from the corresponding Laplace transform  $F(s)$  by merely replacing  $s$  by  $j\omega$ . Note that this is not the case, for example, for  $u(t)$  or  $\cos atu(t)$ .

# 18.7 Applications

Besides its usefulness for circuit analysis, the Fourier transform is used extensively in a variety of fields such as optics, spectroscopy, acoustics, computer science, and electrical engineering. In electrical engineering, it is applied in communications systems and signal processing, where frequency response and frequency spectra are vital. Here we consider two simple applications: amplitude modulation (AM) and sampling.

# 18.7.1 Amplitude Modulation

Electromagnetic radiation or transmission of information through space has become an indispensable part of a modern technological society. However, transmission through space is only efficient and economical at high frequencies (above  $20\mathrm{kHz}$  ). To transmit intelligent signals- - such as for speech and music- - contained in the low- frequency range of  $50\mathrm{Hz}$  to  $20~\mathrm{kHz}$  is expensive; it requires a huge amount of power and large antennas. A common method of transmitting lowfrequency audio information is to transmit a high- frequency signal, called a carrier, which is controlled in some way to correspond to the audio information. Three characteristics (amplitude, frequency, or phase) of a carrier can be controlled so as to allow it to carry the intelligent signal, called the modulating signal. Here we will only consider the control of the carrier's amplitude. This is known as amplitude modulation.

Amplitude modulation (AM) is a process whereby the amplitude of the carrier is controlled by the modulating signal.

AM is used in ordinary commercial radio bands and the video portion of commercial television.

Suppose the audio information, such as voice or music (or the modulating signal in general) to be transmitted is  $m(t) = V_{m}$  cos  $\omega_{m}t$  while the high- frequency carrier is  $c(t) = V_{c}$  cos  $\omega_{c}t$  , where  $\omega_{c}\gg \omega_{m}$  Then an AM signal  $f(t)$  is given by

$$
f(t) = V_{c}\left[1 + m(t)\right]\cos \omega_{c}t \tag{18.67}
$$

Figure 18.22 illustrates the modulating signal  $m(t)$  , the carrier  $c(t)$  , and the AM signal  $f(t)$  . We can use the result in Eq. (18.27) together with the Fourier transform of the cosine function (see Example 18.1 or Table 18.1) to determine the spectrum of the AM signal:

$$
\begin{array}{l}{{F(\omega)=\mathcal{F}[V_{c}\cos\omega_{c}t]+\mathcal{F}[V_{c}m(t)\cos\omega_{c}t]}}\\ {{\mathrm{}=V_{c}\pi[\delta(\omega-\omega_{c})+\delta(\omega+\omega_{c})]}}\\ {{\mathrm{}+\frac{V_{c}}{2}[M(\omega-\omega_{c})+M(\omega+\omega_{c})]}}\end{array} \tag{18.68}
$$

where  $M(\omega)$  is the Fourier transform of the modulating signal  $m(t)$  Shown in Fig. 18.23 is the frequency spectrum of the AM signal. Figure 18.23 indicates that the AM signal consists of the carrier and two other sinusoids. The sinusoid with frequency  $\omega_{c} - \omega_{m}$  is known as the lower sideband, while the one with frequency  $\omega_{c} + \omega_{m}$  is known as the upper sideband.

Figure 18.23Frequency spectrum of AM signal.

Notice that we have assumed that the modulating signal is sinusoidal to make the analysis easy. In real life,  $m(t)$  is a nonsinusoidal, band- limited signal—its frequency spectrum is within the range between 0 and  $\omega_{u} = 2\pi f_{u}$  (i.e., the signal has an upper frequency limit). Typically,  $f_{u} = 5\mathrm{kHz}$  for AM radio. If the frequency spectrum of the modulating signal is as shown in Fig. 18.24(a), then the frequency spectrum of the AM signal is shown in Fig. 18.24(b). Thus, to avoid any interference, carriers for AM radio stations are spaced  $10\mathrm{kHz}$  apart.

At the receiving end of the transmission, the audio information is recovered from the modulated carrier by a process known as demodulation.

Example 18.11 A music signal has frequency components from  $15\mathrm{Hz}$  to  $30~\mathrm{kHz}$  . If this signal could be used to amplitude modulate a 1.2- MHz carrier, find the range of frequencies for the lower and upper sidebands.

# Solution:

The lower sideband is the difference of the carrier and modulating frequencies. It will include the frequencies from

$$
1,200,000 - 30,000\mathrm{Hz} = 1,170,000\mathrm{Hz}
$$

to

$$
1,200,000 - 15\mathrm{Hz} = 1,199,985\mathrm{Hz}
$$

The upper sideband is the sum of the carrier and modulating frequencies. It will include the frequencies from

$$
1,200,000 + 15\mathrm{Hz} = 1,200,015\mathrm{Hz}
$$

to

$$
1,200,000 + 30,000\mathrm{Hz} = 1,230,000\mathrm{Hz}
$$

# Practice Problem 18.11

If a 2- MHz carrier is modulated by a 4- kHz intelligent signal, determine the frequencies of the three components of the AM signal that results.

Answer: 2,004,000 Hz, 2,000,000 Hz, 1,996,000 Hz.

Figure 18.25 (a) Continuous (analog) signal to be sampled, (b) train of impulses, (c) sampled (digital) signal.

# 18.7.2 Sampling

In analog systems, signals are processed in their entirety. However, in modern digital systems, only samples of signals are required for processing. This is possible as a result of the sampling theorem given in Section 17.8.1. The sampling can be done by using a train of pulses or impulses. We will use impulse sampling here.

Consider the continuous signal  $g(t)$  shown in Fig. 18.25(a). This can be multiplied by a train of impulses  $\delta (t - n T_{s})$  shown in Fig. 18.25(b), where  $T_{s}$  is the sampling interval and  $f_{s} = 1 / T_{s}$  is the sampling frequency or the sampling rate. The sampled signal  $g_{s}(t)$  is therefore

$$
g_{s}(t) = g(t)\sum_{n = -\infty}^{\infty}\delta (t - n T_{s}) = \sum_{n = -\infty}^{\infty}g(n T_{s})\delta (t - n T_{s}) \tag{18.69}
$$

The Fourier transform of this is

$$
G_{s}(\omega) = \sum_{n = -\infty}^{\infty}g(n T_{s})\mathcal{F}[\delta (t - n T_{s})] = \sum_{n = -\infty}^{\infty}g(n T_{s})e^{-j n\omega T_{s}} \tag{18.70}
$$

It can be shown that

$$
\sum_{n = -\infty}^{\infty}g(n T_{s})e^{-j n\omega T_{s}} = \frac{1}{T_{s}}\sum_{n = -\infty}^{\infty}G(\omega +n\omega_{s}) \tag{18.71}
$$

where  $\omega_{s} = 2\pi /T_{s}$ . Thus, Eq. (18.70) becomes

$$
G_{s}(\omega) = \frac{1}{T_{s}}\sum_{n = -\infty}^{\infty}G(\omega +n\omega_{s}) \tag{18.72}
$$

This shows that the Fourier transform  $G_{s}(\omega)$  of the sampled signal is a sum of translates of the Fourier transform of the original signal at a rate of  $1 / T_{s}$ .

To ensure optimum recovery of the original signal, what must be the sampling interval? This fundamental question in sampling is answered by an equivalent part of the sampling theorem:

A band- limited signal, with no frequency component higher than  $W$  hertz, may be completely recovered from its samples taken at a frequency at least twice as high as  $2W$  samples per second.

In other words, for a signal with bandwidth  $W$  hertz, there is no loss of information or overlapping if the sampling frequency is at least twice the highest frequency in the modulating signal. Thus,

$$
\frac{1}{T_{s}} = f_{s}\geq 2W \tag{18.73}
$$

The sampling frequency  $f_{s} = 2W$  is known as the Nyquist frequency or rate, and  $1 / f_{s}$  is the Nyquist interval.

A telephone signal with a cutoff frequency of  $5\mathrm{kHz}$  is sampled at a rate 60 percent higher than the minimum allowed rate. Find the sampling rate.

# Solution:

The minimum sample rate is the Nyquist rate  $= 2W = 2\times 5 = 10\mathrm{kHz}$ . Hence,

$$
f_{s} = 1.60\times 2W = 16\mathrm{kHz}
$$

An audio signal that is band- limited to  $12.5\mathrm{kHz}$  is digitized into 8- bit samples. What is the maximum sampling interval that must be used to ensure complete recovery?

Answer:  $40\mu s$

# 18.8 Summary

1. The Fourier transform converts a nonperiodic function  $f(t)$  into a transform  $F(\omega)$ , where

$$
F(\omega) = \mathcal{F}[f(t)] = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f(t)e^{-j\omega t}dt
$$

2. The inverse Fourier transform of  $F(\omega)$  is

$$
f(t) = \mathcal{F}^{-1}[F(\omega)] = \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}F(\omega)e^{j\omega t}d\omega
$$

3. Important Fourier transform properties and pairs are summarized in Tables 18.1 and 18.2, respectively.

4. Using the Fourier transform method to analyze a circuit involves finding the Fourier transform of the excitation, transforming the circuit element into the frequency domain, solving for the unknown response, and transforming the response to the time domain using the inverse Fourier transform.

5. If  $H(\omega)$  is the transfer function of a network, then  $H(\omega)$  is the Fourier transform of the network's impulse response; that is,

$$
H(\omega) = \mathcal{F}[h(t)]
$$

The output  $V_{o}(\omega)$  of the network can be obtained from the input  $V_{i}(\omega)$  using

$$
V_{o}(\omega) = H(\omega)V_{i}(\omega)
$$

6. Parseval's theorem gives the energy relationship between a function  $f(t)$  and its Fourier transform  $F(\omega)$ . The  $1 - \Omega$  energy is

$$
W_{1\Omega} = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f^{2}(t)dt = \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}|F(\omega)|^{2}d\omega
$$

The theorem is useful in calculating energy carried by a signal either in the time domain or in the frequency domain.

7. Typical applications of the Fourier transform are found in amplitude modulation (AM) and sampling. For AM application, a way of determining the sidebands in an amplitude-modulated wave is derived from the modulation property of the Fourier transform. For sampling application, we found that no information is lost in sampling (required for digital transmission) if the sampling frequency is equal to at least twice the Nyquist rate.

# Enhancing Your Career

# Career in Education

While two thirds of all engineers work in private industry, some work in academia and prepare students for engineering careers. The course on circuit analysis you are studying is an important part of the preparation process. If you enjoy teaching others, you may want to consider becoming an engineering educator.

Engineering professors work on state- of- the- art research projects, teach courses at graduate and undergraduate levels, and provide services to their professional societies and the community at large. They are expected to make original contributions in their areas of specialty. This requires a broad- based education in the fundamentals of electrical engineering and a mastery of the skills necessary for communicating their efforts to others.

If you like to do research, to work at the frontiers of engineering, to make contributions to technological advancement, to invent, consult, and/ or teach, consider a career in engineering education. The best way to start is by talking with your professors and benefiting from their experience.

A solid understanding of mathematics and physics at the undergraduate level is vital to your success as an engineering professor. If you are having difficulty in solving your engineering textbook problems, start correcting any weaknesses you have in your mathematics and physics fundamentals.

Most universities these days require that engineering professors have a doctor's degree. In addition, some universities require that they be actively involved in research leading to publications in reputable journals. To prepare yourself for a career in engineering education, get as broad an education as possible, because electrical engineering is changing rapidly

# 19.1 Introduction

A pair of terminals through which a current may enter or leave a network is known as a port. Two- terminal devices or elements (such as resistors, capacitors, and inductors) result in one- port networks. Most of the circuits we have dealt with so far are two- terminal or one- port circuits, represented in Fig. 19.1(a). We have considered the voltage across or current through a single pair of terminals—such as the two terminals of a resistor, a capacitor, or an inductor. We have also studied four- terminal or two- port circuits involving op amps, transistors, and transformers, as shown in Fig. 19.1(b). In general, a network may have  $n$  ports. A port is an access to the network and consists of a pair of terminals; the current entering one terminal leaves through the other terminal so that the net current entering the port equals zero.

In this chapter, we are mainly concerned with two- port networks (or, simply, two- ports).

A two- port network is an electrical network with two separate ports for input and output.

Thus, a two- port network has two terminal pairs acting as access points. As shown in Fig. 19.1(b), the current entering one terminal of a pair leaves the other terminal in the pair. Three- terminal devices such as transistors can be configured into two- port networks.

Our study of two- port networks is for at least two reasons. First, such networks are useful in communications, control systems, power systems, and electronics. For example, they are used in electronics to model transistors and to facilitate cascaded design. Second, knowing the parameters of a two- port network enables us to treat it as a "black box" when embedded within a larger network.

To characterize a two- port network requires that we relate the terminal quantities  $\mathbf{V}_1$ ,  $\mathbf{V}_2$ ,  $\mathbf{I}_1$ , and  $\mathbf{I}_2$  in Fig. 19.1(b), out of which two are independent. The various terms that relate these voltages and currents are called parameters. Our goal in this chapter is to derive six sets of these parameters. We will show the relationship between these parameters and how two- port networks can be connected in series, parallel, or cascade. As with op- amps, we are only interested in the terminal behavior of the circuits. And we will assume that the two- port circuits contain no independent sources, although they can contain dependent sources. Finally, we will apply some of the concepts developed in this chapter to the analysis of transistor circuits and synthesis of ladder networks.

# 19.2 Impedance Parameters

Impedance and admittance parameters are commonly used in the synthesis of filters. They are also useful in the design and analysis of impedance- matching networks and power distribution networks. We discuss impedance parameters in this section and admittance parameters in the next section.

A two- port network may be voltage- driven as in Fig. 19.2(a) or current- driven as in Fig. 19.2(b). From either Fig. 19.2(a) or (b), the terminal voltages can be related to the terminal currents as

$$
\boxed{ \begin{array}{r}\mathbf{V}_1 = \mathbf{z}_{11}\mathbf{I}_1 + \mathbf{z}_{12}\mathbf{I}_2\\ \mathbf{V}_2 = \mathbf{z}_{21}\mathbf{I}_1 + \mathbf{z}_{22}\mathbf{I}_2 \end{array} } \tag{19.1}
$$

Reminder: Only two of the four variables  $(\mathbf{V}_1, \mathbf{V}_2, \mathbf{I}_1, \text{and} \mathbf{I}_2)$  are independent. The other two can be found using Eq. (19.1).

or in matrix form as

$$
\left[ \begin{array}{l}\mathbf{V}_1\\ \mathbf{V}_2 \end{array} \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{ll}\mathbf{z}_{11} & \mathbf{z}_{12}\\ \mathbf{z}_{21} & \mathbf{z}_{22} \end{array} \right]\left[ \begin{array}{l}\mathbf{I}_1\\ \mathbf{I}_2 \end{array} \right] = \left[\mathbf{z}\right]\left[ \begin{array}{l}\mathbf{I}_1\\ \mathbf{I}_2 \end{array} \right] \tag{19.2}
$$

where the  $\mathbf{z}$  terms are called the impedance parameters, or simply  $\mathbf{z}$  parameters, and have units of ohms.

The values of the parameters can be evaluated by setting  $\mathbf{I}_1 = 0$  (input port open- circuited) or  $\mathbf{I}_2 = 0$  (output port open- circuited). Thus,

Figure 19.4 Interchanging a voltage source at one port with an ideal ammeter at the other port produces the same reading in a reciprocal two-port.

Because the  $z$  parameters are obtained by open- circuiting the input or output port, they are also called the open- circuit impedance parameters. Specifically,

$$
\begin{array}{r l} & {\mathbf{z}_{11} = \mathrm{Open - circuit~input~impedance}}\\ & {\mathbf{z}_{12} = \mathrm{Open - circuit~transfer~impedance~from~port~1~to~port~2}}\\ & {\mathbf{z}_{21} = \mathrm{Open - circuit~transfer~impedance~from~port~2~to~port~1}}\\ & {\mathbf{z}_{22} = \mathrm{Open - circuit~output~impedance}} \end{array} \tag{19.4}
$$

According to Eq. (19.3), we obtain  $\mathbf{z}_{11}$  and  $\mathbf{z}_{21}$  by connecting a voltage  $\mathbf{V}_{1}$  (or a current source  $\mathbf{I}_{1}$ ) to port 1 with port 2 open- circuited as in Fig. 19.3(a) and finding  $\mathbf{I}_{1}$  and  $\mathbf{V}_{2}$ ; we then get

$$
\mathbf{z}_{11} = \frac{\mathbf{V}_{1}}{\mathbf{I}_{1}}, \qquad \mathbf{z}_{21} = \frac{\mathbf{V}_{2}}{\mathbf{I}_{1}} \tag{19.5}
$$

Similarly, we obtain  $\mathbf{z}_{12}$  and  $\mathbf{z}_{22}$  by connecting a voltage  $\mathbf{V}_{2}$  (or a current source  $\mathbf{I}_{2}$ ) to port 2 with port 1 open- circuited as in Fig. 19.3(b) and finding  $\mathbf{I}_{2}$  and  $\mathbf{V}_{1}$ ; we then get

$$
\mathbf{z}_{12} = \frac{\mathbf{V}_{1}}{\mathbf{I}_{2}}, \qquad \mathbf{z}_{22} = \frac{\mathbf{V}_{2}}{\mathbf{I}_{2}} \tag{19.6}
$$

The above procedure provides us with a means of calculating or measuring the  $z$  parameters.

Sometimes  $\mathbf{z}_{11}$  and  $\mathbf{z}_{22}$  are called driving- point impedances, while  $\mathbf{z}_{21}$  and  $\mathbf{z}_{12}$  are called transfer impedances. A driving- point impedance is the input impedance of a two- terminal (one- port) device. Thus,  $\mathbf{z}_{11}$  is the input driving- point impedance with the output port open- circuited, while  $\mathbf{z}_{22}$  is the output driving- point impedance with the input port open- circuited.

When  $\mathbf{z}_{11} = \mathbf{z}_{22}$ , the two- port network is said to be symmetrical. This implies that the network has mirrorlike symmetry about some center line; that is, a line can be found that divides the network into two similar halves.

When the two- port network is linear and has no dependent sources, the transfer impedances are equal ( $\mathbf{z}_{12} = \mathbf{z}_{21}$ ), and the two- port is said to be reciprocal. This means that if the points of excitation and response are interchanged, the transfer impedances remain the same. As illustrated in Fig. 19.4, a two- port is reciprocal if interchanging an ideal voltage source at one port with an ideal ammeter at the other port gives the same ammeter reading. The reciprocal network yields  $\mathbf{V} = \mathbf{z}_{12}\mathbf{I}$  according to Eq. (19.1) when connected as in Fig. 19.4(a), but yields  $\mathbf{V} = \mathbf{z}_{21}\mathbf{I}$  when connected as in Fig. 19.4(b). This is possible only if  $\mathbf{z}_{12} = \mathbf{z}_{21}$ . Any two- port that is made entirely of resistors, capacitors, and inductors must be reciprocal. A reciprocal network can be replaced by the T- equivalent circuit in Fig. 19.5(a). If the network is not reciprocal, a more general equivalent network is shown in Fig. 19.5(b); notice that this figure follows directly from Eq. (19.1).

Figure 19.5 (a) T-equivalent circuit (for reciprocal case only), (b) general equivalent circuit.

It should be mentioned that for some two- port networks, the  $z$  parameters do not exist because they cannot be described by Eq. (19.1). As an example, consider the ideal transformer of Fig. 19.6. The defining equations for the two- port network are:

$$
\mathbf{V}_{1} = \frac{1}{n}\mathbf{V}_{2},\qquad \mathbf{I}_{1} = -n\mathbf{I}_{2} \tag{19.7}
$$

Observe that it is impossible to express the voltages in terms of the currents, and vice versa, as Eq. (19.1) requires. Thus, the ideal transformer has no  $z$  parameters. However, it does have hybrid parameters, as we shall see in Section 19.4.

Figure 19.6 An ideal transformer has no  $z$  parameters.

Determine the  $z$  parameters for the circuit in Fig. 19.7.

# Solution:

■ METHOD 1 To determine  $\mathbf{z}_{11}$  and  $\mathbf{z}_{21}$ , we apply a voltage source  $\mathbf{V}_{1}$  to the input port and leave the output port open as in Fig. 19.8(a). Then,

$$
\mathbf{z}_{11} = \frac{\mathbf{V}_{1}}{\mathbf{I}_{1}} = \frac{(20 + 40)\mathbf{I}_{1}}{\mathbf{I}_{1}} = 60\Omega
$$

that is,  $\mathbf{z}_{11}$  is the input impedance at port 1.

$$
\mathbf{z}_{21} = \frac{\mathbf{V}_{2}}{\mathbf{I}_{1}} = \frac{40\mathbf{I}_{1}}{\mathbf{I}_{1}} = 40\Omega
$$

To find  $\mathbf{z}_{12}$  and  $\mathbf{z}_{22}$ , we apply a voltage source  $\mathbf{V}_{2}$  to the output port and leave the input port open as in Fig. 19.8(b). Then,

$$
\mathbf{z}_{12} = \frac{\mathbf{V}_{1}}{\mathbf{I}_{2}} = \frac{40\mathbf{I}_{2}}{\mathbf{I}_{2}} = 40\Omega ,\qquad \mathbf{z}_{22} = \frac{\mathbf{V}_{2}}{\mathbf{I}_{2}} = \frac{(30 + 40)\mathbf{I}_{2}}{\mathbf{I}_{2}} = 70\Omega
$$

Thus,

$$
[\mathbf{z}] = \left[ \begin{array}{ll}60\Omega & 40\Omega \\ 40\Omega & 70\Omega \end{array} \right]
$$

■ METHOD 2 Alternatively, as there is no dependent source in the given circuit,  $\mathbf{z}_{12} = \mathbf{z}_{22}$  and we can use Fig. 19.5(a). Comparing Fig. 19.7 with Fig. 19.5(a), we get

$$
\begin{array}{r l}{\mathbf{z}_{12} = 40\Omega = \mathbf{z}_{21}} & {}\\ {\mathbf{z}_{11} - \mathbf{z}_{12} = 20} & {\Rightarrow \qquad \mathbf{z}_{11} = 20 + \mathbf{z}_{12} = 60\Omega}\\ {\mathbf{z}_{22} - \mathbf{z}_{12} = 30} & {\Rightarrow \qquad \mathbf{z}_{22} = 30 + \mathbf{z}_{12} = 70\Omega} \end{array}
$$

Figure 19.10 For Example 19.2.

# Solution:

This is not a reciprocal network. We may use the equivalent circuit in Fig. 19.5(b) but we can also use Eq. (19.1) directly. Substituting the given  $z$  parameters into Eq. (19.1),

$$
\begin{array}{r}\mathbf{V}_{1} = 40\mathbf{I}_{1} + j20\mathbf{I}_{2} \\ \mathbf{V}_{2} = j30\mathbf{I}_{1} + 50\mathbf{I}_{2} \end{array} \tag{19.2.1}
$$

Because we are looking for  $\mathbf{I}_{1}$  and  $\mathbf{I}_{2}$ , we substitute

$$
\mathbf{V}_{1} = 100\underline{{0^{\circ}}},\qquad \mathbf{V}_{2} = -10\mathbf{I}_{2}
$$

into Eqs. (19.2.1) and (19.2.2), which become

$$
100 = 40\mathbf{I}_{1} + j20\mathbf{I}_{2} \tag{19.2.3}
$$

$$
-10\mathbf{I}_{2} = j30\mathbf{I}_{1} + 50\mathbf{I}_{2} \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad \mathbf{I}_{1} = j2\mathbf{I}_{2} \tag{19.2.4}
$$

Substituting Eq. (19.2.4) into Eq. (19.2.3) gives

$$
100 = j80\mathbf{I}_{2} + j20\mathbf{I}_{2} \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad \mathbf{I}_{2} = \frac{100}{j100} = -j
$$

From Eq. (19.2.4),  $\mathbf{I}_{1} = j2(- j) = 2$ . Thus,

$$
\mathbf{I}_{1} = 2\underline{{0^{\circ}}}\mathrm{A},\qquad \mathbf{I}_{2} = 1\underline{{-90^{\circ}}}\mathrm{A}
$$

# 19.3 Admittance Parameters

In the previous section we saw that impedance parameters may not exist for a two- port network. So there is a need for an alternative means of describing such a network. This need may be met by the second set of parameters, which we obtain by expressing the terminal currents in terms of the terminal voltages. In either Fig. 19.12(a) or (b), the terminal currents can be expressed in terms of the terminal voltages as

$$
\begin{array}{r}{\mathbf{I}_{1} = \mathbf{y}_{11}\mathbf{V}_{1} + \mathbf{y}_{12}\mathbf{V}_{2}}\\ {\mathbf{I}_{2} = \mathbf{y}_{21}\mathbf{V}_{1} + \mathbf{y}_{22}\mathbf{V}_{2}} \end{array} \tag{19.8}
$$

or in matrix form as

$$
\left[ \begin{array}{l}{\mathbf{I}_{1}}\\ {\mathbf{I}_{2}} \end{array} \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{l l}{\mathbf{y}_{11}} & {\mathbf{y}_{12}}\\ {\mathbf{y}_{21}} & {\mathbf{y}_{22}} \end{array} \right]\left[ \begin{array}{l}{\mathbf{V}_{1}}\\ {\mathbf{V}_{2}} \end{array} \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{l}{\mathbf{y}} \end{array} \right]\left[ \begin{array}{l}{\mathbf{V}_{1}}\\ {\mathbf{V}_{2}} \end{array} \right] \tag{19.9}
$$

The  $\mathbf{y}$  terms are known as the admittance parameters (or, simply,  $y$  parameters) and have units of siemens.

The values of the parameters can be determined by setting  $\mathbf{V}_{1} = 0$  (input port short- circuited) or  $\mathbf{V}_{2} = 0$  (output port short- circuited). Thus,

$$
\begin{array}{r l} & {\left.\mathbf{y}_{11} = \frac{\mathbf{I}_{1}}{\mathbf{V}_{1}}|_{\mathbf{v}_{2} = 0},\quad \mathbf{y}_{12} = \frac{\mathbf{I}_{1}}{\mathbf{V}_{2}}|_{\mathbf{v}_{1} = 0}}\\ & {\left.\mathbf{y}_{21} = \frac{\mathbf{I}_{2}}{\mathbf{V}_{1}}|_{\mathbf{v}_{2} = 0},\quad \mathbf{y}_{22} = \frac{\mathbf{I}_{2}}{\mathbf{V}_{2}}|_{\mathbf{v}_{1} = 0}} \end{array} \tag{19.10}
$$

Because the  $y$  parameters are obtained by short- circuiting the input or output port, they are also called the short- circuit admittance parameters. Specifically,

$\mathbf{y}_{11} =$  Short- circuit input admittance

$\mathbf{y}_{12} =$  Short- circuit transfer admittance from port 2 to port 1

$\mathbf{y}_{21} =$  Short- circuit transfer admittance from port 1 to port 2

$\mathbf{y}_{22} =$  Short- circuit output admittance

Following Eq. (19.10), we obtain  $\mathbf{y}_{11}$  and  $\mathbf{y}_{21}$  by connecting a current  $\mathbf{I}_{1}$  to port 1 and short- circuiting port 2 as in Fig. 19.12(a), finding  $\mathbf{V}_{1}$  and  $\mathbf{I}_{2}$ , and then calculating

$$
\mathbf{y}_{11} = \frac{\mathbf{I}_{1}}{\mathbf{V}_{1}},\qquad \mathbf{y}_{21} = \frac{\mathbf{I}_{2}}{\mathbf{V}_{1}} \tag{19.12}
$$

Similarly, we obtain  $\mathbf{y}_{12}$  and  $\mathbf{y}_{22}$  by connecting a current source  $\mathbf{I}_{2}$  to port 2 and short- circuiting port 1 as in Fig. 19.12(b), finding  $\mathbf{I}_{1}$  and  $\mathbf{V}_{2}$ , and then getting

$$
\mathbf{y}_{12} = \frac{\mathbf{I}_{1}}{\mathbf{V}_{2}},\qquad \mathbf{y}_{22} = \frac{\mathbf{I}_{2}}{\mathbf{V}_{2}} \tag{19.13}
$$

This procedure provides us with a means of calculating or measuring the  $y$  parameters. The impedance and admittance parameters are collectively referred to as immittance parameters.

For a two- port network that is linear and has no dependent sources, the transfer admittances are equal  $(\mathbf{y}_{12} = \mathbf{y}_{21})$ . This can be proved in the same way as for the  $z$  parameters. A reciprocal network  $(\mathbf{y}_{12} = \mathbf{y}_{21})$  can be modeled by the  $\Pi$ - equivalent circuit in Fig. 19.13(a). If the network is not reciprocal, a more general equivalent network is shown in Fig. 19.13(b).

Figure 19.14 For Example 19.3.

METHOD 1 To find  $\mathbf{y}_{11}$  and  $\mathbf{y}_{21}$ , short- circuit the output port and connect a current source  $\mathbf{I}_{1}$  to the input port as in Fig. 19.15(a). Because the  $8 - \Omega$  resistor is short- circuited, the  $2 - \Omega$  resistor is in parallel with the  $4 - \Omega$  resistor. Hence,

$$
\mathbf{V}_{1} = \mathbf{I}_{2}(4\parallel 2) = \frac{4}{3}\mathbf{I}_{1},\qquad \mathbf{y}_{11} = \frac{\mathbf{I}_{1}}{\mathbf{V}_{1}} = \frac{\mathbf{I}_{1}}{\frac{4}{3}\mathbf{I}_{1}} = 0.75\mathbf{S}
$$

By current division,

$$
-\mathbf{I}_{2} = \frac{4}{4 + 2}\mathbf{I}_{1} = \frac{2}{3}\mathbf{I}_{1},\qquad \mathbf{y}_{21} = \frac{\mathbf{I}_{2}}{\mathbf{V}_{1}} = \frac{-\frac{2}{3}\mathbf{I}_{1}}{\frac{4}{3}\mathbf{I}_{1}} = -0.5\mathbf{S}
$$

(a)

To get  $\mathbf{y}_{12}$  and  $\mathbf{y}_{22}$ , short- circuit the input port and connect a current source  $\mathbf{I}_{2}$  to the output port as in Fig. 19.15(b). The  $4 - \Omega$  resistor is short- circuited so that the  $2 -$  and  $8 - \Omega$  resistors are in parallel.

$$
\mathbf{V}_{2} = \mathbf{I}_{2}(8\parallel 2) = \frac{8}{5}\mathbf{I}_{2},\qquad \mathbf{y}_{22} = \frac{\mathbf{I}_{2}}{\mathbf{V}_{2}} = \frac{\mathbf{I}_{2}}{\frac{8}{5}\mathbf{I}_{2}} = \frac{5}{8} = 0.625\mathbf{S}
$$

By current division,

$$
-\mathbf{I}_{1} = \frac{8}{8 + 2}\mathbf{I}_{2} = \frac{4}{5}\mathbf{I}_{2},\qquad \mathbf{y}_{12} = \frac{\mathbf{I}_{1}}{\mathbf{V}_{2}} = \frac{-\frac{4}{5}\mathbf{I}_{2}}{\frac{8}{5}\mathbf{I}_{2}} = -0.5\mathbf{S}

Determine the  $y$  parameters for the two- port shown in Fig. 19.17.

# Solution:

We follow the same procedure as in the previous example. To get  $\mathbf{y}_{11}$  and  $\mathbf{y}_{21}$ , we use the circuit in Fig. 19.18(a), in which port 2 is short- circuited and a current source is applied to port 1. At node 1,

$$
\frac{\mathbf{V}_1 - \mathbf{V}_o}{8} = 2\mathbf{I}_1 + \frac{\mathbf{V}_o}{2} +\frac{\mathbf{V}_o - 0}{4}
$$

But  $\mathbf{I}_1 = \frac{\mathbf{V}_1 - \mathbf{V}_o}{8}$  therefore,

$$
0 = \frac{\mathbf{V}_1 - \mathbf{V}_o}{8} +\frac{3\mathbf{V}_o}{4}
$$

$$
0 = \mathbf{V}_1 - \mathbf{V}_o + 6\mathbf{V}_o\qquad \Rightarrow \qquad \mathbf{V}_1 = -5\mathbf{V}_o
$$

Solution of Example 19.4: (a) finding  $\mathbf{y}_{11}$  and  $\mathbf{y}_{21}$ , (b) finding  $\mathbf{y}_{12}$  and  $\mathbf{y}_{22}$ .

Hence,

$$
\mathbf{I}_1 = \frac{-5\mathbf{V}_o - \mathbf{V}_o}{8} = -0.75\mathbf{V}_o
$$

and

$$
\mathbf{y}_{11} = \frac{\mathbf{I}_1}{\mathbf{V}_1} = \frac{-0.75\mathbf{V}_o}{-5\mathbf{V}_o} = 0.15 \mathrm{S}
$$

At node 2,

$$
\frac{\mathbf{V}_o - 0}{4} +2\mathbf{I}_1 + \mathbf{I}_2 = 0
$$

or

$$
-\mathbf{I}_{2} = 0.25\mathbf{V}_{o} - 1.5\mathbf{V}_{o} = -1.25\mathbf{V}_{o}
$$

Hence,

$$
\mathbf{y}_{21} = \frac{\mathbf{I}_{2}}{\mathbf{V}_{1}} = \frac{1.25\mathbf{V}_{o}}{-5\mathbf{V}_{o}} = -0.25\mathbf{S}
$$

Similarly, we get  $\mathbf{y}_{12}$  and  $\mathbf{y}_{22}$  using Fig. 19.18(b). At node 1,

$$
\frac{0 - \mathbf{V}_{o}}{8} = 2\mathbf{I}_{1} + \frac{\mathbf{V}_{o}}{2} +\frac{\mathbf{V}_{o} - \mathbf{V}_{2}}{4}
$$

But  $\mathbf{I}_{1} = \frac{0 - \mathbf{V}_{o}}{8}$ ; therefore,

$$
0 = -\frac{\mathbf{V}_{o}}{8} +\frac{\mathbf{V}_{o}}{2} +\frac{\mathbf{V}_{o} - \mathbf{V}_{2}}{4}
$$

or

$$
0 = -\mathbf{V}_{o} + 4\mathbf{V}_{o} + 2\mathbf{V}_{o} - 2\mathbf{V}_{2}\qquad \Rightarrow \qquad \mathbf{V}_{2} = 2.5\mathbf{V}_{o}
$$

Hence,

$$
\mathbf{y}_{12} = \frac{\mathbf{I}_{1}}{\mathbf{V}_{2}} = \frac{-\mathbf{V}_{o} / 8}{2.5\mathbf{V}_{o}} = -0.05\mathbf{S}
$$

At node 2,

$$
\frac{\mathbf{V}_{o} - \mathbf{V}_{2}}{4} +2\mathbf{I}_{1} + \mathbf{I}_{2} = 0
$$

or

$$
-\mathbf{I}_{2} = 0.25\mathbf{V}_{o} - \frac{1}{4} (2.5\mathbf{V}_{o}) - \frac{2\mathbf{V}_{o}}{8} = -0.625\mathbf{V}_{o}
$$

Thus,

$$
\mathbf{y}_{22} = \frac{\mathbf{I}_{2}}{\mathbf{V}_{2}} = \frac{0.625\mathbf{V}_{o}}{2.5\mathbf{V}_{o}} = 0.25\mathbf{S}
$$

Notice that  $\mathbf{y}_{12}\neq \mathbf{y}_{21}$  in this case, given that the network is not reciprocal.

Obtain the  $y$  parameters for the circuit in Fig. 19.19.

Answer:  $\mathbf{y}_{11} = 625\mathrm{mS}$ ,  $\mathbf{y}_{12} = - 125\mathrm{mS}$ ,  $\mathbf{y}_{21} = 375\mathrm{mS}$ ,  $\mathbf{y}_{22} = 125\mathrm{mS}$ .

# 19.4 Hybrid Parameters

The  $z$  and  $y$  parameters of a two- port network do not always exist. So there is a need for developing another set of parameters. This third set of parameters is based on making  $\mathbf{V}_{1}$  and  $\mathbf{I}_{2}$  the dependent variables. Thus, we obtain

$$
\begin{array}{r}\mathbf{V}_{1} = \mathbf{h}_{11}\mathbf{I}_{1} + \mathbf{h}_{12}\mathbf{V}_{2} \\ \mathbf{I}_{2} = \mathbf{h}_{21}\mathbf{I}_{1} + \mathbf{h}_{22}\mathbf{V}_{2} \end{array} \tag{19.14}
$$

or in matrix form,

$$
\begin{array}{r}\left[ \begin{array}{l}\mathbf{V}_1\\ \mathbf{I}_2 \end{array} \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{ll}\mathbf{h}_{11} & \mathbf{h}_{12}\\ \mathbf{h}_{21} & \mathbf{h}_{22} \end{array} \right]\left[ \begin{array}{l}\mathbf{I}_1\\ \mathbf{V}_2 \end{array} \right] = \left[\mathbf{h}\right]\left[ \begin{array}{l}\mathbf{I}_1\\ \mathbf{V}_2 \end{array} \right] \end{array} \tag{19.15}
$$

The h terms are known as the hybrid parameters (or, simply,  $h$  parameters) because they are a hybrid combination of ratios. They are very useful for describing electronic devices such as transistors (see Section 19.9); it is much easier to measure experimentally the  $h$  parameters of such devices than to measure their  $z$  or  $y$  parameters. In fact, we have seen that the ideal transformer in Fig. 19.6, described by Eq. (19.7), does not have  $z$  parameters. The ideal transformer can be described by the hybrid parameters, because Eq. (19.7) conforms with Eq. (19.14).The values of the parameters are determined as

The values of the parameters are determined as

$$
\begin{array}{r}\left|\mathbf{h}_{11} = \frac{\mathbf{V}_1}{\mathbf{I}_1}\right|_{\mathbf{V}_2 = 0},\qquad \mathbf{h}_{12} = \frac{\mathbf{V}_1}{\mathbf{V}_2}\bigg|_{\mathbf{I}_1 = 0}\\ \left|\mathbf{h}_{21} = \frac{\mathbf{I}_2}{\mathbf{I}_1}\right|_{\mathbf{V}_2 = 0},\qquad \mathbf{h}_{22} = \frac{\mathbf{I}_2}{\mathbf{V}_2}\bigg|_{\mathbf{I}_1 = 0} \end{array} \tag{19.16}
$$

It is evident from Eq. (19.16) that the parameters  $\mathbf{h}_{11}, \mathbf{h}_{12}, \mathbf{h}_{21}$ , and  $\mathbf{h}_{22}$  represent an impedance, a voltage gain, a current gain, and an admittance, respectively. This is why they are called the hybrid parameters. To be specific,

$$
\begin{array}{rl} & {\mathbf{h}_{11} = \mathrm{S h o r t - c i r c u i t i n p u t i m p e d a n c e}}\\ & {\mathbf{h}_{12} = \mathrm{O p e n - c i r c u i t r e v e r s e v o l t a g e g a i n}}\\ & {\mathbf{h}_{21} = \mathrm{S h o r t - c i r c u i t f o r w a r d c u r r e n t g a i n}}\\ & {\mathbf{h}_{22} = \mathrm{O p e n - c i r c u i t o u t p u t a d m i t t a n c e}} \end{array} \tag{19.17}
$$

The procedure for calculating the  $h$  parameters is similar to that used for the  $z$  or  $y$  parameters. We apply a voltage or current source to the appropriate port, short- circuit or open- circuit the other port, depending on the parameter of interest, and perform regular circuit analysis. For reciprocal networks,  $\mathbf{h}_{12} = - \mathbf{h}_{21}$ . This can be proved in the same way as we proved that  $\mathbf{z}_{12} = \mathbf{z}_{21}$ . Figure 19.20 shows the hybrid model of a two- port network.

A set of parameters closely related to the  $h$  parameters are the  $g$  parameters or inverse hybrid parameters. These are used to describe the terminal currents and voltages as

$$
\begin{array}{r}\mathbf{I}_1 = \mathbf{g}_{11}\mathbf{V}_1 + \mathbf{g}_{12}\mathbf{I}_2\\ \mathbf{V}_2 = \mathbf{g}_{21}\mathbf{V}_1 + \mathbf{g}_{22}\mathbf{I}_2 \end{array} \tag{19.18}
$$

To find  $\mathbf{h}_{11}$  and  $\mathbf{h}_{21}$ , we short- circuit the output port and connect a current source  $\mathbf{I}_{1}$  to the input port as shown in Fig. 19.23(a). From Fig. 19.23(a),

$$
\mathbf{V}_{1} = \mathbf{I}_{1}(2 + 3\parallel 6) = 4\mathbf{I}_{1}
$$

Hence,

$$
\mathbf{h}_{11} = \frac{\mathbf{V}_{1}}{\mathbf{I}_{1}} = 4 \Omega
$$

Also, from Fig. 19.23(a) we obtain, by current division,

$$
-\mathbf{I}_{2} = \frac{6}{6 + 3} \mathbf{I}_{1} = \frac{2}{3} \mathbf{I}_{1}
$$

Hence,

$$
\mathbf{h}_{21} = \frac{\mathbf{I}_{2}}{\mathbf{I}_{1}} = -\frac{2}{3}
$$

To obtain  $\mathbf{h}_{12}$  and  $\mathbf{h}_{22}$ , we open- circuit the input port and connect a voltage source  $\mathbf{V}_{2}$  to the output port as in Fig. 19.23(b). By voltage division,

$$
\mathbf{V}_{1} = \frac{6}{6 + 3} \mathbf{V}_{2} = \frac{2}{3} \mathbf{V}_{2}
$$

Hence,

$$
\mathbf{h}_{12} = \frac{\mathbf{V}_{1}}{\mathbf{V}_{2}} = \frac{2}{3}
$$

Also,

$$
\mathbf{V}_{2} = (3 + 6) \mathbf{I}_{2} = 9 \mathbf{I}_{2}

Thus,

$$
\mathbf{h}_{22} = \frac{\mathbf{I}_{2}}{\mathbf{V}_{2}} = \frac{1}{9}\mathbf{S}

Figure 19.24 For Practice Prob. 19.5.

Determine the Thevenin equivalent at the output port of the circuit in Fig. 19.25.

# Solution:

To find  $\mathbf{Z}_{\mathrm{Th}}$  and  $\mathbf{V}_{\mathrm{Th}}$  we apply the normal procedure, keeping in mind the formulas relating the input and output ports of the  $h$  model. To obtain  $\mathbf{Z}_{\mathrm{Th}}$  remove the 60- V voltage source at the input port and apply a 1- V voltage source at the output port, as shown in Fig. 19.26(a). From Eq. (19.14),

$$
\begin{array}{r}\mathbf{V}_{1} = \mathbf{h}_{11}\mathbf{I}_{1} + \mathbf{h}_{12}\mathbf{V}_{2}\\ \mathbf{I}_{2} = \mathbf{h}_{21}\mathbf{I}_{1} + \mathbf{h}_{22}\mathbf{V}_{2} \end{array} \tag{19.6.1}
$$

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-14/63c420e9-9220-47ad-935a-09e6b2aeb2a8/e3a856655fc6d65a55c719553032289d04515a309b3a206980d5a33119bcb367.jpg)  
Figure 19.25 For Example 19.6.

But  $\mathbf{V}_{2} = 1$  ,and  $\mathbf{V}_{1} = - 40\mathbf{I}_{1}$  . Substituting these into Eqs. (19.6.1) and (19.6.2), we get

$$
-40\mathbf{I}_{1} = \mathbf{h}_{11}\mathbf{I}_{1} + \mathbf{h}_{12}\qquad \Rightarrow \qquad \mathbf{I}_{1} = -\frac{\mathbf{h}_{12}}{40 + \mathbf{h}_{11}} \tag{19.6.3}
$$

$$
\mathbf{I}_{2} = \mathbf{h}_{21}\mathbf{I}_{1} + \mathbf{h}_{22} \tag{19.6.4}
$$

Substituting Eq. (19.6.3) into Eq. (19.6.4) gives

$$
\mathbf{I}_{2} = \mathbf{h}_{22} - \frac{\mathbf{h}_{21}\mathbf{h}_{12}}{\mathbf{h}_{11} + 40} = \frac{\mathbf{h}_{11}\mathbf{h}_{22} - \mathbf{h}_{21}\mathbf{h}_{12} + \mathbf{h}_{22}40}{\mathbf{h}_{11} + 40}
$$

Therefore,

$$
\mathbf{Z}_{\mathrm{Th}} = \frac{\mathbf{V}_{2}}{\mathbf{I}_{2}} = \frac{1}{\mathbf{I}_{2}} = \frac{\mathbf{h}_{11} + 40}{\mathbf{h}_{11}\mathbf{h}_{22} - \mathbf{h}_{21}\mathbf{h}_{12} + \mathbf{h}_{22}40}
$$

Substituting the values of the  $h$  parameters,

$$
\begin{array}{r l} & {\mathbf{Z}_{\mathrm{Th}} = \frac{1000 + 40}{10^{3}\times 200\times 10^{-6} + 20 + 40\times 200\times 10^{-6}}}\\ & {\qquad = \frac{1040}{20.21} = 51.46\Omega} \end{array}
$$

To get  $\mathbf{V}_{\mathrm{Th}}$  we find the open- circuit voltage  $\mathbf{V}_{2}$  in Fig. 19.26(b). At the input port,

$$
-60 + 40\mathbf{I}_{1} + \mathbf{V}_{1} = 0\qquad \Rightarrow \qquad \mathbf{V}_{1} = 60 - 40\mathbf{I}_{1} \tag{19.6.5}
$$

Figure 19.26 For Example 19.6: (a) finding  $\mathbf{Z}_{\mathrm{Th}}$  (b) finding  $\mathbf{V}_{\mathrm{Th}}$

At the output,

$$
\mathbf{I}_{2} = 0 \tag{19.6.6}
$$

Substituting Eqs. (19.6.5) and (19.6.6) into Eqs. (19.6.1) and (19.6.2), we obtain

$$
60 - 40\mathbf{I}_{1} = \mathbf{h}_{11}\mathbf{I}_{1} + \mathbf{h}_{12}\mathbf{V}_{2}
$$

or

$$
60 = (\mathbf{h}_{11} + 40)\mathbf{I}_{1} + \mathbf{h}_{12}\mathbf{V}_{2} \tag{19.6.7}
$$

and

$$
0 = \mathbf{h}_{21}\mathbf{I}_{1} + \mathbf{h}_{22}\mathbf{V}_{2} \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad \mathbf{I}_{1} = \frac{\mathbf{h}_{22}}{\mathbf{h}_{21}}\mathbf{V}_{2} \tag{19.6.8}
$$

Now substituting Eq. (19.6.8) into Eq. (19.6.7) gives

$$
60 = \left[-(\mathbf{h}_{11} + 40)\frac{\mathbf{h}_{22}}{\mathbf{h}_{21}} +\mathbf{h}_{12}\right]\mathbf{V}_{2}
$$

or

$$
\mathbf{V}_{\mathrm{Th}} = \mathbf{V}_{2} = \frac{60}{-(\mathbf{h}_{11} + 40)\mathbf{h}_{22} / \mathbf{h}_{21} + \mathbf{h}_{12}} = \frac{60\mathbf{h}_{21}}{\mathbf{h}_{12}\mathbf{h}_{21} - \mathbf{h}_{11}\mathbf{h}_{22} - 40\mathbf{h}_{22}}
$$

Substituting the values of the  $h$  parameters,

$$
\mathbf{V}_{\mathrm{Th}} = \frac{60\times 10}{-20.21} = -29.69\mathrm{~V}
$$

$$

To get  $\mathbf{g}_{11}$  and  $\mathbf{g}_{21}$ , we open- circuit the output port and connect a voltage source  $\mathbf{V}_{1}$  to the input port as in Fig. 19.29(a). From the figure,

$$
\mathbf{I}_{1} = \frac{\mathbf{V}_{1}}{s + 1}
$$

or

$$
\mathbf{g}_{11} = \frac{\mathbf{I}_{1}}{\mathbf{V}_{1}} = \frac{1}{s + 1}
$$

By voltage division,

$$
\mathbf{V}_{2} = \frac{1}{s + 1}\mathbf{V}_{1}
$$

or

$$
\mathbf{g}_{21} = \frac{\mathbf{V}_{2}}{\mathbf{V}_{1}} = \frac{1}{s + 1}
$$

To obtain  $\mathbf{g}_{12}$  and  $\mathbf{g}_{22}$ , we short- circuit the input port and connect a current source  $\mathbf{I}_{2}$  to the output port as in Fig. 19.29(b). By current division,

$$
\mathbf{I}_{1} = -\frac{1}{s + 1}\mathbf{I}_{2}
$$

or

$$
\mathbf{g}_{12} = \frac{\mathbf{I}_{1}}{\mathbf{I}_{2}} = -\frac{1}{s + 1}
$$

Also,

$$
\mathbf{V}_{2} = \mathbf{I}_{2}\left(\frac{1}{s} +s\parallel 1\right)
$$

or

$$
\mathbf{g}_{22} = \frac{\mathbf{V}_{2}}{\mathbf{I}_{2}} = \frac{1}{s} +\frac{s}{s + 1} = \frac{s^{2} + s + 1}{s(s + 1)}
$$

Thus,

$$

# 19.5 Transmission Parameters

Because there are no restrictions on which terminal voltages and currents should be considered independent and which should be dependent variables, we expect to be able to generate many sets of parameters.

Another set of parameters relates the variables at the input port to those at the output port. Thus,

$$
\begin{array}{r}\mathbf{V}_1 = \mathbf{A}\mathbf{V}_2 - \mathbf{B}\mathbf{I}_2\\ \mathbf{I}_1 = \mathbf{C}\mathbf{V}_2 - \mathbf{D}\mathbf{I}_2 \end{array} \tag{19.22}
$$

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-14/63c420e9-9220-47ad-935a-09e6b2aeb2a8/c9d0c63cbb7b19e9be3f43d7e6c7ef3b8bf66c6bfe275953740909c49f5dab17.jpg)  
Figure 19.31 Terminal variables used to define the ADCB parameters.

$$
\begin{array}{r}\left[ \begin{array}{l}\mathbf{V}_1\\ \mathbf{I}_1 \end{array} \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{ll}\mathbf{A} & \mathbf{B}\\ \mathbf{C} & \mathbf{D} \end{array} \right]\left[ \begin{array}{l}\mathbf{V}_2\\ \mathbf{I}_2 \end{array} \right] = \left[\mathbf{T}\right]\left[ \begin{array}{l}\mathbf{V}_2\\ \mathbf{I}_2 \end{array} \right] \end{array} \tag{19.23}
$$

Equations (19.22) and (19.23) relate the input variables  $\mathbf{V}_1$  and  $\mathbf{I}_1$  to the output variables  $\mathbf{V}_2$  and  $- \mathbf{I}_2$ . Notice that in computing the transmission parameters,  $- \mathbf{I}_2$  is used rather than  $\mathbf{I}_2$ , because the current is considered to be leaving the network, as shown in Fig. 19.31, as opposed to entering the network as in Fig. 19.1(b). This is done merely for conventional reasons; when you cascade two- ports (output to input), it is most logical to think of  $\mathbf{I}_2$  as leaving the two- port. It is also customary in the power industry to consider  $\mathbf{I}_2$  as leaving the two- port.

The two- port parameters in Eqs. (19.22) and (19.23) provide a measure of how a circuit transmits voltage and current from a source to a load. They are useful in the analysis of transmission lines (such as cable and fiber) because they express sending- end variables  $\mathbf{V}_1$  and  $\mathbf{I}_1$  in terms of the receiving- end variables  $\mathbf{V}_2$  and  $- \mathbf{I}_2$ . For this reason, they are called transmission parameters. They are also known as ABCD parameters. They are used in the design of telephone systems, microwave networks, and radars.

The transmission parameters are determined as

$$
\begin{array}{r}\mathbf{A} = \frac{\mathbf{V}_1}{\mathbf{V}_2}\Big|_{\mathbf{I}_2 = 0},\qquad \mathbf{B} = -\frac{\mathbf{V}_1}{\mathbf{I}_2}\Big|_{\mathbf{V}_2 = 0}\\ \mathbf{C} = \frac{\mathbf{I}_1}{\mathbf{V}_2}\Big|_{\mathbf{I}_2 = 0},\qquad \mathbf{D} = -\frac{\mathbf{I}_1}{\mathbf{I}_2}\Big|_{\mathbf{V}_2 = 0} \end{array} \tag{19.24}
$$

Thus, the transmission parameters are called, specifically,

$\mathbf{A} =$  Open- circuit voltage ratio  $\mathbf{B} =$  Negative short- circuit transfer impedance  $\mathbf{C} =$  Open- circuit transfer admittance  $\mathbf{D} =$  Negative short- circuit current ratio

$\mathbf{A}$  and  $\mathbf{D}$  are dimensionless,  $\mathbf{B}$  is in ohms, and  $\mathbf{C}$  is in semens. Because the transmission parameters provide a direct relationship between input and output variables, they are very useful in cascaded networks.

Our last set of parameters may be defined by expressing the variables at the output port in terms of the variables at the input port. We obtain

$$
\begin{array}{r}\mathbf{V}_2 = \mathbf{a}\mathbf{V}_1 - \mathbf{b}\mathbf{I}_1\\ \mathbf{I}_2 = \mathbf{c}\mathbf{V}_1 - \mathbf{d}\mathbf{I}_1 \end{array} \tag{19.26}
$$

or

$$
\begin{array}{r}{\left[{\bf V}_{2}\right] = \left[{\bf a}\quad {\bf b}\right]\left[{\bf V}_{1}\right] = \left[{\bf t}\right]\left[{\bf V}_{1}\right]}\\ {\left[{\bf I}_{2}\right] = \left[{\bf c}\quad {\bf d}\right]\left[-{\bf I}_{1}\right] = \left[{\bf t}\right]\left[-{\bf I}_{1}\right]} \end{array} \tag{19.27}
$$

The parameters  $\mathbf{a}, \mathbf{b}, \mathbf{c},$  and  $\mathbf{d}$  are called the inverse transmission, or  $t$ , parameters. They are determined as follows:

$$
\begin{array}{r l}{\mathbf{a}=\frac{\mathbf{V}_{2}}{\mathbf{V}_{1}}\bigg|_{\mathbf{I}_{1}=0},\qquad\mathbf{b}=-\frac{\mathbf{V}_{2}}{\mathbf{I}_{1}}\bigg|_{\mathbf{V}_{1}=0}}\\ {\mathbf{c}=\frac{\mathbf{I}_{2}}{\mathbf{V}_{1}}\bigg|_{\mathbf{I}_{1}=0},\qquad\mathbf{d}=-\frac{\mathbf{I}_{2}}{\mathbf{I}_{1}}\bigg|_{\mathbf{V}_{1}=0}}\end{array} \tag{19.28}
$$

From Eq. (19.28) and from our experience so far, it is evident that these parameters are known individually as

$$
\begin{array}{r l} & {\mathbf{a} = \mathrm{Open - circuit~voltage~gain}}\\ & {\mathbf{b} = \mathrm{Negative~short - circuit~transfer~impedance}}\\ & {\mathbf{c} = \mathrm{Open - circuit~transfer~admittance}}\\ & {\mathbf{d} = \mathrm{Negative~short - circuit~current~gain}} \end{array} \tag{19.29}
$$

While  $\mathbf{a}$  and  $\mathbf{d}$  are dimensionless,  $\mathbf{b}$  and  $\mathbf{c}$  are in ohms and siemens, respectively.

In terms of the transmission or inverse transmission parameters, a network is reciprocal if

$$
\boxed{\mathbf{AD} - \mathbf{BC} = 1,\qquad \mathbf{ad} - \mathbf{bc} = 1} \tag{19.30}
$$

These relations can be proved in the same way as the transfer impedance relations for the  $z$  parameters. Alternatively, we will be able to use Table 19.1 a little later to derive Eq. (19.30) from the fact that  $\mathbf{z}_{12} = \mathbf{z}_{21}$  for reciprocal networks.

Find the transmission parameters for the two- port network in Fig. 19.32.

# Solution:

To determine  $\mathbf{A}$  and  $\mathbf{C}$ , we leave the output port open as in Fig. 19.33(a) so that  $\mathbf{I}_{2} = 0$  and place a voltage source  $\mathbf{V}_{1}$  at the input port. We have

$$
\mathbf{V}_{1} = (10 + 20)\mathbf{I}_{1} = 30\mathbf{I}_{1}\qquad \mathrm{and}\qquad \mathbf{V}_{2} = 20\mathbf{I}_{1} - 3\mathbf{I}_{1} = 17\mathbf{I}_{1}
$$

Thus,

$$
\mathbf{A} = \frac{\mathbf{V}_{1}}{\mathbf{V}_{2}} = \frac{30\mathbf{I}_{1}}{17\mathbf{I}_{1}} = 1.765,\qquad \mathbf{C} = \frac{\mathbf{I}_{1}}{\mathbf{V}_{2}} = \frac{\mathbf{I}_{1}}{17\mathbf{I}_{1}} = 0.0588\mathbf{S}
$$

To obtain  $\mathbf{B}$  and  $\mathbf{D}$ , we short- circuit the output port so that  $\mathbf{V}_{2} = 0$  as shown in Fig. 19.33(b) and place a voltage source  $\mathbf{V}_{1}$  at the input port. At node  $a$  in the circuit of Fig. 19.33(b), KCL gives

$$
\frac{\mathbf{V}_1 - \mathbf{V}_a}{10} -\frac{\mathbf{V}_a}{20} +\mathbf{I}_2 = 0 \tag{19.8.1}
$$

Figure 19.33 For Example 19.8: (a) finding A and C, (b) finding B and D.

But  $\mathbf{V}_{a} = 3\mathbf{I}_{1}$  and  $\mathbf{I}_{1} = (\mathbf{V}_{1} - \mathbf{V}_{a}) / 10$ . Combining these gives

$$
\mathbf{V}_{a} = 3\mathbf{I}_{1} \qquad \mathbf{V}_{1} = 13\mathbf{I}_{1} \tag{19.8.2}
$$

Substituting  $\mathbf{V}_{a} = 3\mathbf{I}_{1}$  into Eq. (19.8.1) and replacing the first term with  $\mathbf{I}_{1}$ ,

$$
\mathbf{I}_{1} - \frac{3\mathbf{I}_{1}}{20} +\mathbf{I}_{2} = 0 \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad \frac{17}{20}\mathbf{I}_{1} = -\mathbf{I}_{2}
$$

Therefore,

$$
\mathbf{D} = -\frac{\mathbf{I}_{1}}{\mathbf{I}_{2}} = \frac{20}{17} = 1.176, \qquad \mathbf{B} = -\frac{\mathbf{V}_{1}}{\mathbf{I}_{2}} = \frac{-13\mathbf{I}_{1}}{(-17 / 20)\mathbf{I}_{1}} = 15.29\Omega
$$

Figure 19.34 For Example 19.9.

The ABCD parameters of the two- port network in Fig. 19.34 are

$$
\left[ \begin{array}{cc}4 & 20\Omega \\ 0.1\mathrm{~S} & 2 \end{array} \right]
$$

The output port is connected to a variable load for maximum power transfer. Find  $R_{L}$  and the maximum power transferred.

# Solution:

What we need is to find the Thevenin equivalent ( $\mathbf{Z}_{\mathrm{Th}}$  and  $\mathbf{V}_{\mathrm{Th}}$ ) at the load or output port. We find  $\mathbf{Z}_{\mathrm{Th}}$  using the circuit in Fig. 19.35(a). Our goal is to get  $\mathbf{Z}_{\mathrm{Th}} = \mathbf{V}_{2} / \mathbf{I}_{2}$ . Substituting the given ABCD parameters into Eq. (19.22), we obtain

$$
\begin{array}{r}\mathbf{V}_{1} = 4\mathbf{V}_{2} - 20\mathbf{I}_{2} \\ \mathbf{I}_{1} = 0.1\mathbf{V}_{2} - 2\mathbf{I}_{2} \end{array} \tag{19.9.1}
$$

At the input port,  $\mathbf{V}_{1} = - 10\mathbf{I}_{1}$ . Substituting this into Eq. (19.9.1) gives

$$
-10\mathbf{I}_{1} = 4\mathbf{V}_{2} - 20\mathbf{I}_{2}
$$

or

$$
\mathbf{I}_{1} = -0.4\mathbf{V}_{2} + 2\mathbf{I}_{2} \tag{19.9.3}
$$

Figure 19.35 Solution of Example 19.9: (a) finding  $\mathbf{Z}_{\mathrm{Th}}$ , (b) finding  $\mathbf{V}_{\mathrm{Th}}$ , (c) finding  $R_{L}$  for maximum power transfer.

Setting the right- hand sides of Eqs. (19.9.2) and (19.9.3) equal,

$$
0.1\mathbf{V}_{2} - 2\mathbf{I}_{2} = -0.4\mathbf{V}_{2} + 2\mathbf{I}_{2}\qquad \Rightarrow \qquad 0.5\mathbf{V}_{2} = 4\mathbf{I}_{2}
$$

Hence,

$$
\mathbf{Z}_{\mathrm{Th}} = \frac{\mathbf{V}_{2}}{\mathbf{I}_{2}} = \frac{4}{0.5} = 8 \Omega
$$

To find  $\mathbf{V}_{\mathrm{Th}}$ , we use the circuit in Fig. 19.35(b). At the output port  $\mathbf{I}_{2} = 0$  and at the input port  $\mathbf{V}_{1} = 50 - 10\mathbf{I}_{1}$ . Substituting these into Eqs. (19.9.1) and (19.9.2),

$$
\begin{array}{c}50 - 10\mathbf{I}_{1} = 4\mathbf{V}_{2} \\ \mathbf{I}_{1} = 0.1\mathbf{V}_{2} \end{array} \tag{19.9.4}
$$

Substituting Eq. (19.9.5) into Eq. (19.9.4),

$$
50 - \mathbf{V}_{2} = 4\mathbf{V}_{2} \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad \mathbf{V}_{2} = 10
$$

Thus,

$$
\mathbf{V}_{\mathrm{Th}} = \mathbf{V}_{2} = 10 \mathbf{V}
$$

The equivalent circuit is shown in Fig. 19.35(c). For maximum power transfer,

$$
R_{L} = \mathbf{Z}_{\mathrm{Th}} = 8 \Omega
$$

From Eq. (4.24), the maximum power is

$$
P = I^{2}R_{L} = \left(\frac{\mathbf{V}_{\mathrm{Th}}}{2R_{L}}\right)^{2}R_{L} = \frac{\mathbf{V}_{\mathrm{Th}}^{2}}{4R_{L}} = \frac{100}{4 \times 8} = 3.125 \mathrm{~W}
$$

Find  $\mathbf{I}_{1}$  and  $\mathbf{I}_{2}$  if the transmission parameters for the two- port in Fig. 19.36 are

# 19.6 'Relationships Between Parameters

Because the six sets of parameters relate the same input and output terminal variables of the same two- port network, they should be interrelated. If two sets of parameters exist, we can relate one set to the other set. Let us demonstrate the process with two examples.

Given the  $z$  parameters, let us obtain the  $y$  parameters. From Eq. (19.2),

$$
\begin{array}{r}{\left[{\bf V}_{1}\right] = \left[{\bf z}_{11} {\bf z}_{12}\right] \left[{\bf I}_{1}\right] = \left[{\bf z}\right] \left[{\bf I}_{1}\right]}\\ {\left[{\bf V}_{2}\right] = \left[{\bf z}_{21} {\bf z}_{22}\right] \left[{\bf I}_{2}\right] = \left[{\bf z}\right] \left[{\bf I}_{2}\right]} \end{array} \tag{19.31}
$$

or

$$
\left[{\bf I}_{1}\right] = [{\bf z}]^{-1}\left[{\bf V}_{1}\right] \tag{19.32}
$$

Also, from Eq. (19.9),

$$
\left[{\bf I}_{1}\right] = \left[{\bf y}_{11} {\bf y}_{12}\right] \left[{\bf V}_{1}\right] = \left[{\bf y}\right] \left[{\bf V}_{1}\right] \tag{19.33}
$$

Comparing Eqs. (19.32) and (19.33), we see that

$$
[\mathbf{y}] = [\mathbf{z}]^{-1} \tag{19.34}
$$

The adjoint of the  $[\mathbf{z}]$  matrix is

$$
\left[{\bf z}_{22} - {\bf z}_{12}\right] - {\bf z}_{21} {\bf z}_{11}]
$$

and its determinant is

$$
\Delta_{z} = \mathbf{z}_{11}\mathbf{z}_{22} - \mathbf{z}_{12}\mathbf{z}_{21}
$$

Substituting these into Eq. (19.34), we get

$$
\left[{\bf y}_{11} {\bf y}_{12}\right] = \frac{\left[{\bf z}_{22} - {\bf z}_{12}\right]}{\Delta_{z}} \tag{19.35}
$$

Equating terms yields

$$
\mathbf{y}_{11} = \frac{\mathbf{z}_{22}}{\Delta_{z}}, \qquad \mathbf{y}_{12} = -\frac{\mathbf{z}_{12}}{\Delta_{z}}, \qquad \mathbf{y}_{21} = -\frac{\mathbf{z}_{21}}{\Delta_{z}}, \qquad \mathbf{y}_{22} = \frac{\mathbf{z}_{11}}{\Delta_{z}} \tag{19.36}
$$

As a second example, let us determine the  $h$  parameters from the  $z$  parameters. From Eq. (19.1),

$$
\begin{array}{r}{\mathbf{V}_{1} = \mathbf{z}_{11}\mathbf{I}_{1} + \mathbf{z}_{12}\mathbf{I}_{2}}\\ {\mathbf{V}_{2} = \mathbf{z}_{21}\mathbf{I}_{1} + \mathbf{z}_{22}\mathbf{I}_{2}} \end{array} \tag{19.37b}
$$

Making  $\mathbf{I}_{2}$  the subject of Eq. (19.37b),

$$
\mathbf{I}_{2} = -\frac{\mathbf{z}_{21}}{\mathbf{z}_{22}}\mathbf{I}_{1} + \frac{1}{\mathbf{z}_{22}}\mathbf{V}_{2} \tag{19.38}
$$

Substituting this into Eq. (19.37a),

$$
\mathbf{V}_{1} = \frac{\mathbf{z}_{11}\mathbf{z}_{22} - \mathbf{z}_{12}\mathbf{z}_{21}}{\mathbf{z}_{22}}\mathbf{I}_{1} + \frac{\mathbf{z}_{12}}{\mathbf{z}_{22}}\mathbf{V}_{2} \tag{19.39}
$$

Putting Eqs. (19.38) and (19.39) in matrix form,

$$
\left[ \begin{array}{c}\mathbf{V}_1\\ \mathbf{I}_2 \end{array} \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{cc}\frac{\Delta_z}{\mathbf{z}_{22}} & \frac{\mathbf{z}_{12}}{\mathbf{z}_{22}}\\ -\frac{\mathbf{z}_{21}}{\mathbf{z}_{22}} & \frac{1}{\mathbf{z}_{22}} \end{array} \right]\left[ \begin{array}{c}\mathbf{I}_1\\ \mathbf{V}_2 \end{array} \right] \tag{19.40}
$$

From Eq. (19.15),

$$
\left[ \begin{array}{c}\mathbf{V}_1\\ \mathbf{I}_2 \end{array} \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{cc}\mathbf{h}_{11} & \mathbf{h}_{12}\\ \mathbf{h}_{21} & \mathbf{h}_{22} \end{array} \right]\left[ \begin{array}{c}\mathbf{I}_1\\ \mathbf{V}_2 \end{array} \right]
$$

Comparing this with Eq. (19.40), we obtain

$$
\mathbf{h}_{11} = \frac{\Delta_z}{\mathbf{z}_{22}},\qquad \mathbf{h}_{12} = \frac{\mathbf{z}_{12}}{\mathbf{z}_{22}},\qquad \mathbf{h}_{21} = -\frac{\mathbf{z}_{21}}{\mathbf{z}_{22}},\qquad \mathbf{h}_{22} = \frac{1}{\mathbf{z}_{22}} \tag{19.41}
$$

Table 19.1 provides the conversion formulas for the six sets of two- port parameters. Given one set of parameters, Table 19.1 can be used to find other parameters. For example, given the  $T$  parameters, we find the corresponding  $h$  parameters in the fifth column of the third

row. Also, given that  $\mathbf{z}_{21} = \mathbf{z}_{12}$  for a reciprocal network, we can use the table to express this condition in terms of other parameters. It can also be shown that

$$
[\mathbf{g}] = [\mathbf{h}]^{-1} \tag{19.42}
$$

but

$$
[\mathbf{t}] \neq [\mathbf{T}]^{-1} \tag{19.43}
$$

Example 19.10 Find  $[\mathbf{z}]$  and  $[\mathbf{g}]$  of a two- port network if

$$
[\mathbf{T}] = \left[ \begin{array}{cc}10 & 1.5 \Omega \\ 2 \mathbf{S} & 4 \end{array} \right]
$$

# Solution:

If  $\mathbf{A} = 10$ ,  $\mathbf{B} = 1.5$ ,  $\mathbf{C} = 2$ ,  $\mathbf{D} = 4$ , the determinant of the matrix is

$$
\Delta_{T} = \mathbf{A} \mathbf{D} - \mathbf{B} \mathbf{C} = 40 - 3 = 37
$$

From Table 19.1,

$$
\mathbf{z}_{11} = \frac{\mathbf{A}}{\mathbf{C}} = \frac{10}{2} = 5, \qquad \mathbf{z}_{12} = \frac{\Delta_{T}}{\mathbf{C}} = \frac{37}{2} = 18.5
$$

$$
\mathbf{z}_{21} = \frac{1}{\mathbf{C}} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5, \qquad \mathbf{z}_{22} = \frac{\mathbf{D}}{\mathbf{C}} = \frac{4}{2} = 2
$$

$$
\mathbf{g}_{11} = \frac{\mathbf{C}}{\mathbf{A}} = \frac{2}{10} = 0.2, \qquad \mathbf{g}_{12} = -\frac{\Delta_{T}}{\mathbf{A}} = -\frac{37}{10} = -3.7
$$

$$
\mathbf{g}_{21} = \frac{1}{\mathbf{A}} = \frac{1}{10} = 0.1, \qquad \mathbf{g}_{22} = \frac{\mathbf{B}}{\mathbf{A}} = \frac{1.5}{10} = 0.15
$$

Thus,

$$
[\mathbf{z}] = \left[ \begin{array}{cc}5 & 18.5 \\ 0.5 & 2 \end{array} \right] \Omega , \qquad [\mathbf{g}] = \left[ \begin{array}{cc}0.2 \mathbf{S} & -3.7 \\ 0.1 & 0.15 \Omega \end{array} \right]
$$

Practice Problem 19.10 Determine  $[\mathbf{y}]$  and  $[\mathbf{T}]$  of a two- port network whose  $z$  parameters are

$$
[\mathbf{z}] = \left[ \begin{array}{cc}6 & 4 \\ 4 & 6 \end{array} \right] \Omega
$$

Answer:  $[\mathbf{y}] = \left[ \begin{array}{cc}0.3 & - 0.2 \\ - 0.2 & 0.3 \end{array} \right] \mathbf{S}, \quad [\mathbf{T}] = \left[ \begin{array}{cc}1.5 & 5 \Omega \\ 0.25 \mathbf{S} & 1.5 \end{array} \right]$ .

Example 19.11 Obtain the  $y$  parameters of the op amp circuit in Fig. 19.37. Show that the circuit has no  $z$  parameters.

# Solution:

Because no current can enter the input terminals of the op amp,  $\mathbf{I}_{1} = 0$ , which can be expressed in terms of  $\mathbf{V}_{1}$  and  $\mathbf{V}_{2}$  as

$$
\mathbf{I}_{1} = 0 \mathbf{V}_{1} + 0 \mathbf{V}_{2} \tag{19.11.1}
$$

Comparing this with Eq. (19.8) gives

$$
\mathbf{y}_{11} = 0 = \mathbf{y}_{12}
$$

Also,

$$
\mathbf{V}_{2} = R_{3}\mathbf{I}_{2} + \mathbf{I}_{o}(R_{1} + R_{2})
$$

where  $\mathbf{I}_{o}$  is the current through  $R_{1}$  and  $R_{2}$ . But  $\mathbf{I}_{o} = \mathbf{V}_{1} / R_{2}$ . Hence,

$$
\mathbf{V}_{2} = R_{3}\mathbf{I}_{2} + \frac{\mathbf{V}_{1}(R_{1} + R_{2})}{R_{1}}
$$

which can be written as

$$
\mathbf{I}_{2} = \frac{(R_{1} + R_{2})}{R_{1}R_{3}}\mathbf{V}_{1} + \frac{\mathbf{V}_{2}}{R_{3}}
$$

Comparing this with Eq. (19.8) shows that

$$
\mathbf{y}_{21} = \frac{(R_{1} + R_{2})}{R_{1}R_{3}},\qquad \mathbf{y}_{22} = \frac{1}{R_{3}}
$$

The determinant of the  $[\mathbf{y}]$  matrix is

$$
\Delta_{y} = \mathbf{y}_{11}\mathbf{y}_{22} - \mathbf{y}_{12}\mathbf{y}_{21} = 0
$$

Since  $\Delta_{y} = 0$ , the  $[\mathbf{y}]$  matrix has no inverse; therefore, the  $[\mathbf{z}]$  matrix does not exist according to Eq. (19.34). Note that the circuit is not reciprocal because of the active element.

Find the  $z$  parameters of the op amp circuit in Fig. 19.38. Show that the circuit has no  $y$  parameters.

Answer:  $[\mathbf{z}] = \begin{bmatrix} R_{1} & 0 \\ - R_{2} & 0 \end{bmatrix}$ . Because  $[\mathbf{z}]^{- 1}$  does not exist,  $[\mathbf{y}]$  does not exist.

# 19.7 Interconnection of Networks

A large, complex network may be divided into subnetworks for the purposes of analysis and design. The subnetworks are modeled as two- port networks, interconnected to form the original network. The two- port networks may therefore be regarded as building blocks that can be interconnected to form a complex network. The interconnection can be in series, in parallel, or in cascade. Although the interconnected network can be described by any of the six parameter sets, a certain set of parameters may have a definite advantage. For example, when the networks are in series, their individual  $z$  parameters add up to give the  $z$  parameters of the larger network. When they are in parallel, their individual  $y$  parameters add up to give the  $y$  parameters of the larger network. When they are cascaded, their individual transmission parameters can be multiplied together to get the transmission parameters of the larger network.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-14/63c420e9-9220-47ad-935a-09e6b2aeb2a8/37ab169dda24d7ff86afc75ee10ab87e507aa988e40f658485b49419e3e22a58.jpg)  
Figure 19.39 Series connection of two two-port networks.

Consider the series connection of two two- port networks shown in Fig. 19.39. The networks are regarded as being in series because their input currents are the same and their voltages add. In addition, each network has a common reference, and when the circuits are placed in series, the common reference points of each circuit are connected together. For network  $N_{a}$ ,

$$
\begin{array}{r}\mathbf{V}_{1a} = \mathbf{z}_{11a}\mathbf{I}_{1a} + \mathbf{z}_{12a}\mathbf{I}_{2a} \\ \mathbf{V}_{2a} = \mathbf{z}_{21a}\mathbf{I}_{1a} + \mathbf{z}_{22a}\mathbf{I}_{2a} \end{array} \tag{19.44}
$$

and for network  $N_{b}$ ,

$$
\begin{array}{r}\mathbf{V}_{1b} = \mathbf{z}_{11b}\mathbf{I}_{1b} + \mathbf{z}_{12b}\mathbf{I}_{2b} \\ \mathbf{V}_{2b} = \mathbf{z}_{21b}\mathbf{I}_{1b} + \mathbf{z}_{22b}\mathbf{I}_{2b} \end{array} \tag{19.45}
$$

We notice from Fig. 19.39 that

$$
\mathbf{I}_{1} = \mathbf{I}_{1a} = \mathbf{I}_{1b}, \qquad \mathbf{I}_{2} = \mathbf{I}_{2a} = \mathbf{I}_{2b} \tag{19.46}
$$

and that

$$
\begin{array}{r}\mathbf{V}_{1} = \mathbf{V}_{1a} + \mathbf{V}_{1b} = (\mathbf{z}_{11a} + \mathbf{z}_{11b})\mathbf{I}_{1} + (\mathbf{z}_{12a} + \mathbf{z}_{12b})\mathbf{I}_{2} \\ \mathbf{V}_{2} = \mathbf{V}_{2a} + \mathbf{V}_{2b} = (\mathbf{z}_{21a} + \mathbf{z}_{21b})\mathbf{I}_{1} + (\mathbf{z}_{22a} + \mathbf{z}_{22b})\mathbf{I}_{2} \end{array} \tag{19.47}
$$

Thus, the  $z$  parameters for the overall network are

$$
\begin{array}{r}\left[ \begin{array}{ll}\mathbf{z}_{11} & \mathbf{z}_{12} \\ \mathbf{z}_{21} & \mathbf{z}_{22} \end{array} \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{ll}\mathbf{z}_{11a} + \mathbf{z}_{11b} & \mathbf{z}_{12a} + \mathbf{z}_{12b} \\ \mathbf{z}_{21a} + \mathbf{z}_{21b} & \mathbf{z}_{22a} + \mathbf{z}_{22b} \end{array} \right] \end{array} \tag{19.48}
$$

or

$$
[\mathbf{z}] = [\mathbf{z}_{a}] + [\mathbf{z}_{b}] \tag{19.49}
$$

showing that the  $z$  parameters for the overall network are the sum of the  $z$  parameters for the individual networks. This can be extended to  $n$  networks in series. If two two- port networks in the  $[\mathbf{h}]$  model, for example, are connected in series, we use Table 19.1 to convert the  $\mathbf{h}$  to  $\mathbf{z}$  and then apply Eq. (19.49). We finally convert the result back to  $\mathbf{h}$  using Table 19.1.

Two two- port networks are in parallel when their port voltages are equal and the port currents of the larger network are the sums of the individual port currents. In addition, each circuit must have a common reference and when the networks are connected together, they must all have their common references tied together. The parallel connection of two two- port networks is shown in Fig. 19.40. For the two networks,

and

$$
\begin{array}{r}\mathbf{I}_{1a} = \mathbf{y}_{11a}\mathbf{V}_{1a} + \mathbf{y}_{12a}\mathbf{V}_{2a} \\ \mathbf{I}_{2a} = \mathbf{y}_{21a}\mathbf{V}_{1a} + \mathbf{y}_{22a}\mathbf{V}_{2a} \end{array} \tag{19.50}
$$

and

$$
\begin{array}{r}\mathbf{I}_{1b} = \mathbf{y}_{11b}\mathbf{V}_{1b} + \mathbf{y}_{12b}\mathbf{V}_{2b} \\ \mathbf{I}_{2a} = \mathbf{y}_{21b}\mathbf{V}_{1b} + \mathbf{y}_{22b}\mathbf{V}_{2b} \end{array} \tag{19.51}
$$

But from Fig. 19.40,

\begin{array}{r l} & {\mathbf{V}_{1} = \mathbf{V}_{1a} = \mathbf{V}_{1b},\qquad \mathbf{V}_{2} = \mathbf{V}_{2a} = \mathbf{V}_{2b}} \\ & {\mathbf{I}_{1} = \mathbf{I}_{1a} + \mathbf{I}_{1b},\qquad \mathbf{I}_{2} = \mathbf{I}_{2a} + \mathbf{I}_{2b}} \end{array} \tag{19.52b}
$$

Substituting Eqs. (19.50) and (19.51) into Eq. (19.52b) yields

$$
\begin{array}{r}\mathbf{I}_1 = (\mathbf{y}_{11a} + \mathbf{y}_{11b})\mathbf{V}_1 + (\mathbf{y}_{12a} + \mathbf{y}_{12b})\mathbf{V}_2\\ \mathbf{I}_2 = (\mathbf{y}_{21a} + \mathbf{y}_{21b})\mathbf{V}_1 + (\mathbf{y}_{22a} + \mathbf{y}_{22b})\mathbf{V}_2 \end{array} \tag{19.53}
$$

Thus, the  $y$  parameters for the overall network are

$$
\begin{array}{r}\left[ \begin{array}{ll}\mathbf{y}_{11} & \mathbf{y}_{12}\\ \mathbf{y}_{21} & \mathbf{y}_{22} \end{array} \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{ll}\mathbf{y}_{11a} + \mathbf{y}_{11b} & \mathbf{y}_{12a} + \mathbf{y}_{12b}\\ \mathbf{y}_{21a} + \mathbf{y}_{21b} & \mathbf{y}_{22a} + \mathbf{y}_{22b} \end{array} \right] \end{array} \tag{19.54}
$$

or

$$
\boxed{ \begin{array}{r}\mathbf{[y]} = [\mathbf{y}_a] + [\mathbf{y}_b] \end{array} } \tag{19.55}
$$

showing that the  $y$  parameters of the overall network are the sum of the  $y$  parameters of the individual networks. The result can be extended to  $n$  two- port networks in parallel.

Two networks are said to be cascaded when the output of one is the input of the other. The connection of two two- port networks in cascade is shown in Fig. 19.41. For the two networks,

$$
\begin{array}{r}\left[ \begin{array}{l}\mathbf{V}_{1a}\\ \mathbf{I}_{1a} \end{array} \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{ll}\mathbf{A}_a & \mathbf{B}_a\\ \mathbf{C}_a & \mathbf{D}_a \end{array} \right]\left[ \begin{array}{l}\mathbf{V}_{2a}\\ -\mathbf{I}_{2a} \end{array} \right]\\ \left[ \begin{array}{l}\mathbf{V}_{1b}\\ \mathbf{I}_{1b} \end{array} \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{ll}\mathbf{A}_b & \mathbf{B}_b\\ \mathbf{C}_b & \mathbf{D}_b \end{array} \right]\left[ \begin{array}{l}\mathbf{V}_{2b}\\ -\mathbf{I}_{2b} \end{array} \right] \end{array} \tag{19.57}
$$

From Fig. 19.41,

$$
\begin{array}{r}\left[ \begin{array}{l}\mathbf{V}_1\\ \mathbf{I}_1 \end{array} \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{l}\mathbf{V}_{1a}\\ \mathbf{I}_{1a} \end{array} \right],\quad \left[ \begin{array}{l}\mathbf{V}_{2a}\\ -\mathbf{I}_{2a} \end{array} \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{l}\mathbf{V}_{1b}\\ \mathbf{I}_{1b} \end{array} \right],\quad \left[ \begin{array}{l}\mathbf{V}_{2b}\\ -\mathbf{I}_{2b} \end{array} \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{l}\mathbf{V}_2\\ -\mathbf{I}_2 \end{array} \right], \end{array} \tag{19.58}
$$

Substituting these into Eqs. (19.56) and (19.57),

$$
\begin{array}{r}\left[ \begin{array}{l}\mathbf{V}_1\\ \mathbf{I}_1 \end{array} \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{ll}\mathbf{A}_a & \mathbf{B}_a\\ \mathbf{C}_a & \mathbf{D}_a \end{array} \right]\left[ \begin{array}{ll}\mathbf{A}_b & \mathbf{B}_b\\ \mathbf{C}_b & \mathbf{D}_b \end{array} \right]\left[ \begin{array}{l}\mathbf{V}_2\\ -\mathbf{I}_2 \end{array} \right] \end{array} \tag{19.59}
$$

Thus, the transmission parameters for the overall network are the product of the transmission parameters for the individual transmission parameters:

$$
\begin{array}{r}\left[ \begin{array}{ll}\mathbf{A} & \mathbf{B}\\ \mathbf{C} & \mathbf{D} \end{array} \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{ll}\mathbf{A}_a & \mathbf{B}_a\\ \mathbf{C}_a & \mathbf{D}_a \end{array} \right]\left[ \begin{array}{ll}\mathbf{A}_b & \mathbf{B}_b\\ \mathbf{C}_b & \mathbf{D}_b \end{ array} \right] \end{array} \tag{19.60}
$$

It is this property that makes the transmission parameters so useful. Keep in mind that the multiplication of the matrices must be in the order in which the networks  $N_{a}$  and  $N_{b}$  are cascaded.

Figure 19.42 For Example 19.12.

# Solution:

This may be regarded as two two- ports in series. For  $N_{b}$

$$
\mathbf{z}_{12b} = \mathbf{z}_{21b} = 10 = \mathbf{z}_{11b} = \mathbf{z}_{22b}
$$

Thus,

$$
[\mathbf{z}] = [\mathbf{z}_{a}] + [\mathbf{z}_{b}] = \left[ \begin{array}{ll}12 & 8 \\ 8 & 20 \end{array} \right] + \left[ \begin{array}{ll}10 & 10 \\ 10 & 10 \end{array} \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{ll}22 & 18 \\ 18 & 30 \end{array} \right]
$$

But

$$
\begin{array}{r}\mathbf{V}_{1} = \mathbf{z}_{11}\mathbf{I}_{1} + \mathbf{z}_{12}\mathbf{I}_{2} = 22\mathbf{I}_{1} + 18\mathbf{I}_{2} \\ \mathbf{V}_{2} = \mathbf{z}_{21}\mathbf{I}_{1} + \mathbf{z}_{22}\mathbf{I}_{2} = 18\mathbf{I}_{1} + 30\mathbf{I}_{2} \end{array} \tag{19.12.1}
$$

Also, at the input port

$$
\mathbf{V}_{1} = \mathbf{V}_{s} - 5\mathbf{I}_{1} \tag{19.12.3}
$$

and at the output port

$$
\mathbf{V}_{2} = -20\mathbf{I}_{2} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \mathbf{I}_{2} = -\frac{\mathbf{V}_{2}}{20} \tag{19.12.4}
$$

Substituting Eqs. (19.12.3) and (19.12.4) into Eq. (19.12.1) gives

$$
\mathbf{V}_{s} - 5\mathbf{I}_{1} = 22\mathbf{I}_{1} - \frac{18}{20}\mathbf{V}_{2} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \mathbf{V}_{s} = 27\mathbf{I}_{1} - 0.9\mathbf{V}_{2} \tag{19.12.5}
$$

while substituting Eq. (19.12.4) into Eq. (19.12.2) yields

$$
\mathbf{V}_{2} = 18\mathbf{I}_{1} - \frac{30}{20}\mathbf{V}_{2} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \mathbf{I}_{1} = \frac{2.5}{18}\mathbf{V}_{2} \tag{19.12.6}
$$

Substituting Eq. (19.12.6) into Eq. (19.12.5), we get

$$
\mathbf{V}_{s} = 27 \times \frac{2.5}{18} \mathbf{V}_{2} - 0.9 \mathbf{V}_{2} = 2.85 \mathbf{V}_{2}.
$$

And so,

$$
\frac{\mathbf{V}_{2}}{\mathbf{V}_{s}} = \frac{1}{2.85} = 0.3509
$$

Find  $\mathbf{V}_{2} / \mathbf{V}_{s}$  in the circuit in Fig. 19.43.

Answer:  $0.6799 / - 29.05^{\circ}$ .

Find the  $y$  parameters of the two- port in Fig. 19.44.

# Solution:

Let us refer to the upper network as  $N_{a}$  and the lower one as  $N_{b}$ . The two networks are connected in parallel. Comparing  $N_{a}$  and  $N_{b}$  with the circuit in Fig. 19.13(a), we obtain

$$
\mathbf{y}_{12a} = -j4 = \mathbf{y}_{21a}, \qquad \mathbf{y}_{11a} = 2 + j4, \qquad \mathbf{y}_{22a} = 3 + j4
$$

or

$$
[\mathbf{y}_{a}] = \left[ \begin{array}{cc}2 + j4 & -j4 \\ -j4 & 3 + j4 \end{array} \right] \mathbf{S}
$$

and

$$
\mathbf{y}_{12b} = -4 = \mathbf{y}_{21b}, \qquad \mathbf{y}_{11b} = 4 - j2, \qquad \mathbf{y}_{22b} = 4 - j6
$$

or

$$
[\mathbf{y}_{b}] = \left[ \begin{array}{cc}4 - j2 & -4 \\ -4 & 4 - j6 \end{array} \right] \mathbf{S}
$$

The overall  $y$  parameters are

$$
[\mathbf{y}] = [\mathbf{y}_{a}] + [\mathbf{y}_{b}] = \left[ \begin{array}{cc}6 + j2 & -4 - j4 \\ -4 - j4 & 7 - j2 \end{array} \right] \mathbf{S}

Find the transmission parameters for the circuit in Fig. 19.46.

# Solution:

We can regard the given circuit in Fig. 19.46 as a cascade connection of two T networks as shown in Fig. 19.47(a). We can show that a T network, shown in Fig. 19.47(b), has the following transmission parameters [see Prob. 19.52(b)]:

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-14/63c420e9-9220-47ad-935a-09e6b2aeb2a8/c6dd508bda14ad81d5e93b540248f6658b32d1b60a2f183ec492e738fefbc4eb.jpg)

Figure 19.47 For Example 19.14: (a) Breaking the circuit in Fig. 19.46 into two two-ports, (b) a general T two-port.

$$
\begin{array}{l l}{{\bf A}=1+\frac{R_{1}}{R_{2}},\quad}&{{\bf B}=R_{3}+\frac{R_{1}(R_{2}+R_{3})}{R_{2}}}\\ {{\bf C}=\frac{1}{R_{2}},\quad}&{{\bf D}=1+\frac{R_{3}}{R_{2}}}\end{array}
$$

Applying this to the cascaded networks  $N_{a}$  and  $N_{b}$  in Fig. 19.47(a), we get

$$
\begin{array}{r l} & {\mathbf{A}_{a} = 1 + 4 = 5,\qquad \mathbf{B}_{a} = 8 + 4\times 9 = 44\Omega}\\ & {\qquad \mathbf{C}_{a} = 1\mathrm{~S},\qquad \mathbf{D}_{a} = 1 + 8 = 9} \end{array}
$$

or in matrix form,

$$
[\mathbf{T}_{a}] = \left[ \begin{array}{cc}5 & 44 \Omega \\ 1 \mathrm{~S} & 9 \end{array} \right]
$$

and

$$
\mathbf{A}_{b} = 1, \qquad \mathbf{B}_{b} = 6 \Omega , \qquad \mathbf{C}_{b} = 0.5 \mathrm{~S}, \qquad \mathbf{D}_{b} = 1 + \frac{6}{2} = 4
$$

i.e.,

$$
[\mathbf{T}_{b}] = \left[ \begin{array}{cc}1 & 6 \Omega \\ 0.5 \mathrm{~S} & 4 \end{array} \right]
$$

Thus, for the total network in Fig. 19.46,

$$
\begin{array}{r l} & {[\mathbf{T}] = [\mathbf{T}_{a}][\mathbf{T}_{b}] = \left[ \begin{array}{l l}{5} & {44}\\ {1} & {9} \end{array} \right]\left[ \begin{array}{l l}{1} & {6}\\ {0.5} & {4} \end{array} \right]}\\ & {\quad = \left[ \begin{array}{l l}{5\times 1 + 44\times 0.5} & {5\times 6 + 44\times 4}\\ {1\times 1 + 9\times 0.5} & {1\times 6 + 9\times 4} \end{array} \right]}\\ & {\quad = \left[ \begin{array}{l l}{27} & {206\Omega}\\ {5.5 \mathrm{~S}} & {42} \end{array} \right]} \end{array}
$$

Notice that

$$
\Delta_{T_{a}} = \Delta_{T_{b}} = \Delta_{T} = 1
$$

showing that the network is reciprocal.

# 19.8 Computing Two-Port Parameters Using PSpice

Hand calculation of the two- port parameters may become difficult when the two- port is complicated. We resort to PSpice in such situations. If the circuit is purely resistive, PSpice dc analysis may be used; otherwise, PSpice ac analysis is required at a specific frequency. The key to using PSpice in computing a particular two- port parameter is to remember how that parameter is defined and to constrain the appropriate port variable with a 1- A or 1- V source while using an open or short circuit to impose the other necessary constraints. The following two examples illustrate the idea.

Find the  $h$  parameters of the network in Fig. 19.49.

# Solution:

From Eq. (19.16),

$$
\mathbf{h}_{11} = \frac{\mathbf{V}_{1}}{\mathbf{I}_{1}}\bigg|_{\mathbf{V}_{2} = 0},\qquad \mathbf{h}_{21} = \frac{\mathbf{I}_{2}}{\mathbf{I}_{1}}\bigg|_{\mathbf{V}_{2} = 0}
$$

showing that  $\mathbf{h}_{11}$  and  $\mathbf{h}_{21}$  can be found by setting  $\mathbf{V}_{2} = 0$ . Also by setting  $\mathbf{I}_{1} = 1$  A,  $\mathbf{h}_{11}$  becomes  $\mathbf{V}_{1} / 1$  while  $\mathbf{h}_{21}$  becomes  $\mathbf{I}_{2} / 1$ . With this in mind, we draw the schematic in Fig. 19.50(a). We insert a 1- A dc current source

IDC to take care of  $\mathbf{I}_{1} = 1$  A, the pseudocomponent VIEWPOINT to display  $\mathbf{V}_{1}$  and pseudocomponent IPROBE to display  $\mathbf{I}_{2}$ . After saving the schematic, we run PSpice by selecting Analysis/Simulate and note the values displayed on the pseudocomponents. We obtain

$$
\mathbf{h}_{11} = \frac{\mathbf{V}_{1}}{1} = 10 \Omega , \qquad \mathbf{h}_{21} = \frac{\mathbf{I}_{2}}{1} = -0.5
$$

Similarly, from Eq. (19.16),

$$
\mathbf{h}_{12} = \frac{\mathbf{V}_{1}}{\mathbf{V}_{2}}\bigg|_{\mathbf{I}_{1} = 0}, \qquad \mathbf{h}_{22} = \frac{\mathbf{I}_{2}}{\mathbf{V}_{2}}\bigg|_{\mathbf{I}_{1} = 0}
$$

indicating that we obtain  $\mathbf{h}_{12}$  and  $\mathbf{h}_{22}$  by open- circuiting the input port  $(\mathbf{I}_{1} = 0)$ . By making  $\mathbf{V}_{2} = 1$  V,  $\mathbf{h}_{12}$  becomes  $\mathbf{V}_{1} / 1$  while  $\mathbf{h}_{22}$  becomes  $\mathbf{I}_{2} / 1$ . Thus, we use the schematic in Fig. 19.50(b) with a 1- V dc voltage source VDC inserted at the output terminal to take care of  $\mathbf{V}_{2} = 1$  V. The pseudocomponents VIEWPOINT and IPROBE are inserted to display the values of  $\mathbf{V}_{1}$  and  $\mathbf{I}_{2}$ , respectively. (Notice that in Fig. 19.50(b), the  $5 - \Omega$  resistor is ignored because the input port is open- circuited and PSpice will not allow such. We may include the  $5 - \Omega$  resistor if we replace the open circuit with a very large resistor, say,  $10 \mathrm{M} \Omega$ .) After simulating the schematic, we obtain the values displayed on the pseudocomponents as shown in Fig. 19.50(b). Thus,

$$
\mathbf{h}_{12} = \frac{\mathbf{V}_{1}}{1} = 0.8333, \qquad \mathbf{h}_{22} = \frac{\mathbf{I}_{2}}{1} = 0.1833 \mathrm{~S}
$$

Figure 19.52 For Example 19.16.

Find the  $z$  parameters for the circuit in Fig. 19.52 at  $\omega = 10^{6} \mathrm{rad} / \mathrm{s}$ .

# Solution:

Notice that we used dc analysis in Example 19.15 because the circuit in Fig. 19.49 is purely resistive. Here, we use ac analysis at  $f = \omega /2\pi = 0.15915 \mathrm{MHz}$ , because  $L$  and  $C$  are frequency dependent.

In Eq. (19.3), we defined the  $z$  parameters as

$$
\mathbf{z}_{11} = \frac{\mathbf{V}_{1}}{\mathbf{I}_{1}}\bigg|_{\mathbf{I}_{2} = 0}, \qquad \mathbf{z}_{21} = \frac{\mathbf{V}_{2}}{\mathbf{I}_{1}}\bigg|_{\mathbf{I}_{2} = 0}
$$

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-14/63c420e9-9220-47ad-935a-09e6b2aeb2a8/9c638c52d503283c7d64a70bd6458c06d77d9c4ff4fb6f32f3a602070d1f8ee2.jpg)  
Figure 19.53For Example 19.16: (a) circuit for determining  $\mathbf{z}_{11}$  and  $\mathbf{z}_{21}$ , (b) circuit for determining  $\mathbf{z}_{12}$  and  $\mathbf{z}_{22}$ .

This suggests that if we let  $\mathbf{I}_1 = 1$  A and open- circuit the output port so that  $\mathbf{I}_2 = 0$ , then we obtain

$$
\mathbf{z}_{11} = \frac{\mathbf{V}_1}{1}\qquad \mathrm{and}\qquad \mathbf{z}_{21} = \frac{\mathbf{V}_2}{1}
$$

We realize this with the schematic in Fig. 19.53(a). We insert a 1- A ac current source IAC at the input terminal of the circuit and two VPRINT1 pseudocomponents to obtain  $\mathbf{V}_1$  and  $\mathbf{V}_2$ . The attributes of each VPRINT1 are set as  $AC = \text{yes}$ ,  $MAG = \text{yes}$ , and  $PHASE = \text{yes}$  to print the magnitude and phase values of the voltages. We select Analysis/Setup/AC Sweep and enter 1 as Total Pts, 0.1519MEG as Start Freq, and 0.1519MEG as Final Freq in the AC Sweep and Noise Analysis dialog box. After saving the schematic, we select Analysis/Simulate to simulate it. We obtain  $\mathbf{V}_1$  and  $\mathbf{V}_2$  from the output file. Thus,

$$
\mathbf{z}_{11} = \frac{\mathbf{V}_1}{1} = 19.70\big / 175.7^\circ \Omega ,\qquad \mathbf{z}_{21} = \frac{\mathbf{V}_2}{1} = 19.79\big / 170.2^\circ \Omega
$$

In a similar manner, from Eq. (19.3),

$$
\mathbf{z}_{12} = \frac{\mathbf{V}_1}{\mathbf{I}_2}\bigg|_{\mathbf{I}_1 = 0},\qquad \mathbf{z}_{22} = \frac{\mathbf{V}_2}{\mathbf{I}_2}\bigg|_{\mathbf{I}_1 = 0}
$$

suggesting that if we let  $\mathbf{I}_2 = 1$  A and open- circuit the input port,

$$
\mathbf{z}_{12} = \frac{\mathbf{V}_1}{1}\qquad \mathrm{and}\qquad \mathbf{z}_{22} = \frac{\mathbf{V}_2}{1}
$$

This leads to the schematic in Fig. 19.53(b). The only difference between this schematic and the one in Fig. 19.53(a) is that the 1- A ac current source IAC is now at the output terminal. We run the schematic in Fig. 19.53(b) and obtain  $\mathbf{V}_{1}$  and  $\mathbf{V}_{2}$  from the output file. Thus,

$$
\mathbf{z}_{12} = \frac{\mathbf{V}_{1}}{1} = 19.70\big / 175.7^{\circ}\Omega ,\qquad \mathbf{z}_{22} = \frac{\mathbf{V}_{2}}{1} = 19.56\big / 175.7^{\circ}\Omega
$$

# 19.9 Applications

We have seen how the six sets of network parameters can be used to characterize a wide range of two- port networks. Depending on the way two- ports are interconnected to form a larger network, a particular set of parameters may have advantages over others, as we noticed in Section 19.7. In this section, we will consider two important application areas of two- port parameters: transistor circuits and synthesis of ladder networks.

# 19.9.1 Transistor Circuits

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-14/63c420e9-9220-47ad-935a-09e6b2aeb2a8/367a99219d58c3fa999ff69f630a9da5144b00fb7c6724793ca72e93666e83a4.jpg)  
Figure 19.55 Two-port network isolating source and load.

The two- port network is often used to isolate a load from the excitation of a circuit. For example, the two- port in Fig. 19.55 may represent an amplifier, a filter, or some other network. When the two- port represents an amplifier, expressions for the voltage gain  $A_{\nu}$ , the current gain  $A_{i}$ , the input impedance  $Z_{\mathrm{in}}$ , and the output impedance  $Z_{\mathrm{out}}$  can be derived with ease. They are defined as follows:

$$
A_{\nu} = \frac{V_{2}(s)}{V_{1}(s)} \tag{19.62}
$$

$$
A_{i} = \frac{I_{2}(s)}{I_{1}(s)} \tag{19.63}
$$

$$
Z_{\mathrm{in}} = \frac{V_{1}(s)}{I_{1}(s)} \tag{19.64}
$$

$$
Z_{\mathrm{out}} = \frac{V_{2}(s)}{I_{2}(s)}\bigg|_{V_{s} = 0} \tag{19.65}
$$

Any of the six sets of two- port parameters can be used to derive the expressions in Eqs. (19.62) to (19.65). However, the hybrid  $(h)$  parameters are the most useful for transistors; they are easily measured and are often provided in the manufacturer's data or spec sheets for transistors. The  $h$  parameters provide a quick estimate of the performance of transistor circuits. They are used for finding the exact voltage gain, input impedance, and output impedance of a transistor.

The  $h$  parameters for transistors have specific meanings expressed by their subscripts. They are listed by the first subscript and related to the general  $h$  parameters as follows:

$$
h_{i} = h_{11},\qquad h_{r} = h_{12},\qquad h_{f} = h_{21},\qquad h_{o} = h_{22} \tag{19.66}
$$

The subscripts  $i, c, f,$  and  $o$  stand for input, reverse, forward, and output. The second subscript specifies the type of connection used:  $e$  for common emitter (CE),  $c$  for common collector (CC), and  $b$  for common base (CB). Here we are mainly concerned with the common- emitter connection. Thus, the four  $h$  parameters for the common- emitter amplifier are:

$$
\begin{array}{rl} & h_{oe} = \mathrm{Base~input~impedance}\\ & h_{re} = \mathrm{Reverse~voltage~feedback~ratio}\\ & h_{fe} = \mathrm{Base - collector~current~gain}\\ & h_{pe} = \mathrm{Output~admittance} \end{array} \tag{19.67}
$$

These are calculated or measured in the same way as the general  $h$  parameters. Typical values are  $h_{ie} = 6 \mathrm{k}\Omega$ ,  $h_{re} = 1.5 \times 10^{- 4}$ ,  $h_{fe} = 200$ ,  $h_{oe} = 8 \mu \mathrm{S}$ . We must keep in mind that these values represent ac characteristics of the transistor, measured under specific circumstances.

Figure 19.56 shows the circuit schematic for the common- emitter amplifier and the equivalent hybrid model. From the figure, we see that

$$
\begin{array}{r}\mathbf{V}_b = h_{ie}\mathbf{I}_b + h_{re}\mathbf{V}_c\\ \mathbf{I}_c = h_{fe}\mathbf{I}_b + h_{oe}\mathbf{V}_c \end{array} \tag{19.68b}
$$

Consider the transistor amplifier connected to an ac source and a load as in Fig. 19.57. This is an example of a two- port network embedded within a larger network. We can analyze the hybrid equivalent circuit as usual with Eq. (19.68) in mind. (See Example 19.6. ) Recognizing

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-14/63c420e9-9220-47ad-935a-09e6b2aeb2a8/fbbd1744de4b6c52d9e6eebd0b1f05b06bd736328c4e81c2166b6dcbfa701b1e.jpg)

from Fig. 19.57 that  $\mathbf{V}_{c} = - R_{L}\mathbf{I}_{c}$  and substituting this into Eq. (19.68b) gives

$$
\mathbf{I}_{c} = h_{fe}\mathbf{I}_{b} - h_{oe}R_{L}\mathbf{I}_{c}
$$

or

$$
(1 + h_{oe}R_{L})\mathbf{I}_{c} = h_{fe}\mathbf{I}_{b} \tag{19.69}
$$

From this, we obtain the current gain as

$$
A_{i} = \frac{\mathbf{I}_{c}}{\mathbf{I}_{b}} = \frac{h_{fe}}{1 + h_{oe}R_{L}} \tag{19.70}
$$

From Eqs. (19.68b) and (19.70), we can express  $\mathbf{I}_{b}$  in terms of  $\mathbf{V}_{c}$ :

$$
\mathbf{I}_{c} = \frac{h_{fe}}{1 + h_{oe}R_{L}}\mathbf{I}_{b} = h_{fe}\mathbf{I}_{b} + h_{oe}\mathbf{V}_{c}
$$

or

$$
\mathbf{I}_{b} = \frac{h_{oe}\mathbf{V}_{c}}{\frac{h_{fe}}{1 + h_{oe}R_{L}} - h_{fe}} \tag{19.71}
$$

Substituting Eq. (19.71) into Eq. (19.68a) and dividing by  $\mathbf{V}_{c}$  gives

$$
\begin{array}{r}\frac{\mathbf{V}_{b}}{\mathbf{V}_{c}} = \frac{h_{oe}h_{ie}}{\frac{h_{fe}}{1 + h_{oe}R_{L}} - h_{fe}} +h_{re}\\ = \frac{h_{ie} + h_{ie}h_{oe}R_{L} - h_{re}h_{fe}R_{L}}{-h_{fe}R_{L}} \end{array} \tag{19.72}
$$

Thus, the voltage gain is

$$
A_{\nu} = \frac{\mathbf{V}_{c}}{\mathbf{V}_{b}} = \frac{-h_{fe}R_{L}}{h_{ie} + (h_{ie}h_{oe} - h_{re}h_{fe})R_{L}} \tag{19.73}
$$

Substituting  $\mathbf{V}_{c} = - R_{L}\mathbf{I}_{c}$  into Eq. (19.68a) gives

$$
\mathbf{V}_{b} = h_{ie}\mathbf{I}_{b} - h_{re}R_{L}\mathbf{I}_{c}
$$

or

$$
\frac{\mathbf{V}_{b}}{\mathbf{I}_{b}} = h_{ie} - h_{re}R_{L}\frac{\mathbf{I}_{c}}{\mathbf{I}_{b}} \tag{19.74}
$$

Replacing  $\mathbf{I}_{c} / \mathbf{I}_{b}$  by the current gain in Eq. (19.70) yields the input impedance as

$$
Z_{\mathrm{in}} = \frac{\mathbf{V}_{b}}{\mathbf{I}_{b}} = h_{ie} - \frac{h_{re}h_{fe}R_{L}}{1 + h_{oe}R_{L}} \tag{19.75}
$$

The output impedance  $Z_{\mathrm{out}}$  is the same as the Thevenin equivalent at the output terminals. As usual, by removing the voltage source and placing a

1- V source at the output terminals, we obtain the circuit in Fig. 19.58, from which  $Z_{\mathrm{out}}$  is determined as  $1 / \mathbf{I}_{c}$ . Because  $\mathbf{V}_{c} = 1 \mathbf{V}$ , the input loop gives

$$
h_{re}(1) = -\mathbf{I}_{b}(R_{s} + h_{ie}) \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad \mathbf{I}_{b} = -\frac{h_{re}}{R_{s} + h_{ie}} \tag{19.76}
$$

For the output loop,

$$
\mathbf{I}_{c} = \mathbf{h}_{oe}(1) + h_{fe}\mathbf{I}_{b} \tag{19.77}
$$

Substituting Eq. (19.76) into Eq. (19.77) gives

$$
\mathbf{I}_{c} = \frac{(R_{s} + h_{ie})h_{oe} - h_{re}h_{fe}}{R_{s} + h_{ie}} \tag{19.78}
$$

From this, we obtain the output impedance  $Z_{\mathrm{out}}$  as  $1 / \mathbf{I}_{c}$ ; that is,

$$
Z_{\mathrm{out}} = \frac{R_{s} + h_{ie}}{(R_{s} + h_{ie})h_{oe} - h_{re}h_{fe}} \tag{19.79}
$$

Consider the common- emitter amplifier circuit of Fig. 19.59. Determine the voltage gain, current gain, input impedance, and output impedance using these  $h$  parameters:

$$
h_{ie} = 1\mathrm{k}\Omega ,\qquad h_{re} = 2.5\times 10^{-4},\qquad h_{fe} = 50,\qquad h_{oe} = 20\mu \mathrm{S}
$$

Figure 19.59 For Example 19.17.

# Solution:

1. Define. In an initial look at this problem, it appears to be clearly stated. However, when we are asked to determine the input impedance and the voltage gain, do they refer to the transistor or the circuit? As far as the current gain and the output impedance are concerned, they are the same for both cases.We ask for clarification and are told that we should calculate the input impedance, the output impedance, and the voltage gain

We ask for clarification and are told that we should calculate the input impedance, the output impedance, and the voltage gain

for the circuit and not the transistor. It is interesting to note that the problem can be restated so that it becomes a simple design problem: Given the  $h$  parameters, design a simple amplifier that has a gain of  $- 60$ .

2. Present. Given a simple transistor circuit, an input voltage of  $3.2\mathrm{mV}$ , and the  $h$  parameters of the transistor, calculate the output voltage.

3. Alternative. There are a couple of ways we can approach the problem, the most straightforward being to use the equivalent circuit shown in Fig. 19.57. Once you have the equivalent circuit you can use circuit analysis to determine the answer. Once you have a solution, you can check it by plugging in the answer into the circuit equations to see if they are correct. Another approach is to simplify the right-hand side of the equivalent circuit and work backward to see if you obtain approximately the same answer. We will use that approach here.

4. Attempt. We note that  $R_{s} = 0.8\mathrm{k}\Omega$  and  $R_{L} = 1.2\mathrm{k}\Omega$ . We treat the transistor of Fig. 19.59 as a two-port network and apply Eqs. (19.70) to (19.79).

$$
\begin{array}{c}{h_{ie}h_{oe} - h_{re}h_{fe} = 10^{3}\times 20\times 10^{-6} - 2.5\times 10^{-4}\times 50}\\ {= 7.5\times 10^{-3}} \end{array}
$$

$$
A_{\nu} = \frac{-h_{fe}R_{L}}{h_{ie} + (h_{re}h_{oe} - h_{re}h_{fe})R_{L}} = \frac{-50\times 1200}{1000 + 7.5\times 10^{-3}\times 1200}\\ = -59.46
$$

$A_{\nu}$  is the voltage gain of the amplifier  $= V_{o} / V_{b}$ . To calculate the gain of the circuit we need to find  $V_{o} / V_{s}$ . We can do this by using the mesh equation for the circuit on the left and Eqs. (19.71) and (19.73).

$$
-\mathrm{V}_s + R_s\mathrm{I}_b + \mathrm{V}_b = 0
$$

or

$$
V_{s} = 800\frac{20\times 10^{-6}}{\frac{50}{1 + 20\times 10^{-6}\times 1.2\times 10^{3}} - 50} -\frac{1}{59.46}\mathrm{V}_{o}\\ = -0.03047\mathrm{V}_{o}.
$$

Thus, the circuit gain is equal to  $- 32.82$ . Now we can calculate the output voltage.

$$
\begin{array}{c}{V_{c} = \mathrm{gain}\times V_{c} = -105.09\underline{{0^{\circ}}}\mathrm{mV},}\\ {A_{i} = \frac{h_{fe}}{1 + h_{oe}R_{L}} = \frac{50}{1 + 20\times 10^{-6}\times 1200} = 48.83} \end{array}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{c}{Z_{\mathrm{in}} = h_{ie} - \frac{h_{re}h_{fe}R_{L}}{1 + h_{oe}R_{L}}}\\ {= 1000 - \frac{2.5\times 10^{-4}\times 50\times 1200}{1 + 20\times 10^{-6}\times 1200}}\\ {= 985.4\Omega} \end{array}
$$

You can modify  $Z_{\mathrm{in}}$  to include the 800- ohm resistor so that

Circuit input impedance  $= 800 + 985.4 = 1785.4\Omega$ .

$$
\begin{array}{r l} & {(R_{s} + h_{i e})h_{o e} - h_{r e}h_{f e}}\\ & {= (800 + 1000)\times 20\times 10^{-6} - 2.5\times 10^{-4}\times 50 = 23.5\times 10^{-3}}\\ & {\qquad Z_{\mathrm{out}} = \frac{R_{s} + h_{i e}}{(R_{s} + h_{i e})h_{o e} - h_{r e}h_{f e}} = \frac{800 + 1000}{23.5\times 10^{-3}} = 76.6\mathrm{~k}\Omega} \end{array}
$$

5. Evaluate. In the equivalent circuit,  $h_{oe}$  represents a resistor of  $50,000 \Omega$ . This is in parallel with a load resistor equal to  $1.2 \mathrm{k} \Omega$ . The size of the load resistor is so small relative to the  $h_{oe}$  resistor that  $h_{oe}$  can be neglected. This then leads to

$$
\mathrm{I}_{c} = h_{fe} \mathrm{I}_{b} = 50 I_{b}, \quad \mathrm{V}_{c} = -1200 \mathrm{I}_{c},
$$

and the following loop equation from the left- hand side of the circuit:

$$
-0.0032 + (800 + 1000) \mathrm{I}_{b} + (0.00025) (-1200) (50) \mathrm{I}_{b} = 0
$$

$$
\mathrm{I}_{b} = 0.0032 / (1785) = 1.7927 \mu \mathrm{A}.
$$

$\mathrm{I}_{c} = 50 \times 1.7927 = 89.64 \mu \mathrm{A}$  and  $\mathrm{V}_{c} = - 1200 \times 89.64 \times 10^{- 6}$

$$
= -107.57 \mathrm{mV}
$$

This is a good approximation to  $- 105.09 \mathrm{mV}$ .

$$
\mathrm{Voltage~gain} = -107.57 / 3.2 = -33.62
$$

Again, this is a good approximation to 32.82.

Circuit input impedance  $= 0.032 / 1.7927 \times 10^{- 6} = 1785 \Omega$

which clearly compares well with the  $1785.4 \Omega$  we obtained before.

For these calculations, we assumed that  $\mathrm{Z}_{\mathrm{out}} = \infty \Omega$ . Our calculations produced  $72.6 \mathrm{k} \Omega$ . We can test our assumption by calculating the equivalent resistance of this and the load resistance.

$$
72,600 \times 1200 / (72,600 + 1200) = 1,180.5 = 1.1805 \mathrm{k} \Omega
$$

Again, we have a good approximation.

6. Satisfactory? We have satisfactorily solved the problem and checked the results. We can now present our results as a solution to the problem.

For the transistor amplifier of Fig. 19.60, find the voltage gain, current gain, input impedance, and output impedance. Assume that

$$
h_{i e} = 6 \mathrm{k} \Omega , \qquad h_{r e} = 1.5 \times 10^{-4}, \qquad h_{f e} = 200, \qquad h_{o e} = 8 \mu \mathrm{S}
$$

Answer:  $- 123.61$  for the transistor and  $- 4.753$  for the circuit, 194.17,  $6 \mathrm{k} \Omega$  for the transistor and  $156 \mathrm{k} \Omega$  for the circuit,  $128.08 \mathrm{k} \Omega$ .

# 19.9.2 Ladder Network Synthesis

Another application of two- port parameters is the synthesis (or building) of ladder networks, which are found frequently in practice and have

Figure 19.61 $LC$  ladder networks for low-pass filters of: (a) odd order, (b) even order.

particular use in designing passive low- pass filters. Based on our discussion of second- order circuits in Chapter 8, the order of the filter is the order of the characteristic equation describing the filter and is determined by the number of reactive elements that cannot be combined into single elements (e.g., through series or parallel combination). Figure 19.61(a) shows an  $LC$  ladder network with an odd number of elements (to realize an odd- order filter), while Fig. 19.61(b) shows one with an even number of elements (for realizing an even- order filter). When either network is terminated by the load impedance  $Z_{L}$  and the source impedance  $Z_{s}$ , we obtain the structure in Fig. 19.62. To make the design less complicated, we will assume that  $Z_{s} = 0$ . Our goal is to synthesize the transfer function of the  $LC$  ladder network. We begin by characterizing the ladder network by its admittance parameters, namely,

$$
\begin{array}{r}\mathbf{I}_1 = \mathbf{y}_{11}\mathbf{V}_1 + \mathbf{y}_{12}\mathbf{V}_2\\ \mathbf{I}_2 = \mathbf{y}_{21}\mathbf{V}_1 + \mathbf{y}_{22}\mathbf{V}_2 \end{array} \tag{19.80b}
$$

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-14/63c420e9-9220-47ad-935a-09e6b2aeb2a8/da6075b6c4795d1fc48497bb15dacb40e00dc8c7c45af9e9981540330167994b.jpg)  
Figure 19.62 $LC$  ladder network with terminating impedances.

(Of course, the impedance parameters could be used instead of the admittance parameters.) At the input port,  $\mathbf{V}_{1} = \mathbf{V}_{s}$  since  $\mathbf{Z}_{s} = 0$ . At the output port,  $\mathbf{V}_{2} = \mathbf{V}_{o}$  and  $\mathbf{I}_{2} = - \mathbf{V}_{2} / \mathbf{Z}_{L} = - \mathbf{V}_{o}\mathbf{Y}_{L}$ . Thus, Eq. (19.80b) becomes

$$
-\mathbf{V}_{o}\mathbf{Y}_{L} = \mathbf{y}_{21}\mathbf{V}_{s} + \mathbf{y}_{22}\mathbf{V}_{o}
$$

or

$$
\mathbf{H}(s) = \frac{\mathbf{V}_{o}}{\mathbf{V}_{s}} = \frac{-\mathbf{y}_{21}}{\mathbf{Y}_{L} + \mathbf{y}_{22}} \tag{19.81}
$$

We can write this as

$$
\mathbf{H}(s) = \frac{\mathbf{y}_{21} / \mathbf{Y}_{L}}{1 + \mathbf{y}_{22} / \mathbf{Y}_{L}} \tag{19.82}
$$

We may ignore the negative sign in Eq. (19.82) because filter requirements are often stated in terms of the magnitude of the transfer function. The main objective in filter design is to select capacitors and inductors so that the parameters  $\mathbf{y}_{21}$  and  $\mathbf{y}_{22}$  are synthesized, thereby realizing the desired transfer function. To achieve this, we take advantage of an important property of the  $LC$  ladder network: All  $z$  and  $y$  parameters are ratios of polynomials that contain only even powers of  $s$  or odd

powers of  $s$  that is, they are ratios of either  $\mathrm{Od}(s) / \mathrm{Ev}(s)$  or  $\mathrm{Ev}(s) / \mathrm{Od}(s)$ , where  $\mathrm{Od}$  and  $\mathrm{Ev}$  are odd and even functions, respectively. Let

$$
\mathbf{H}(s) = \frac{\mathbf{N}(s)}{\mathbf{D}(s)} = \frac{\mathbf{N}_o + \mathbf{N}_e}{\mathbf{D}_o + \mathbf{D}_e} \tag{19.83}
$$

where  $\mathbf{N}(s)$  and  $\mathbf{D}(s)$  are the numerator and denominator of the transfer function  $\mathbf{H}(s)$ ;  $\mathbf{N}_o$  and  $\mathbf{N}_e$  are the odd and even parts of  $\mathbf{N}$ ;  $\mathbf{D}_o$  and  $\mathbf{D}_e$  are the odd and even parts of  $\mathbf{D}$ . Given that  $\mathbf{N}(s)$  must be either odd or even, we can write Eq. (19.83) as

$$
\mathbf{H}(s) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}\frac{\mathbf{N}_o}{\mathbf{D}_o + \mathbf{D}_e}, & (\mathbf{N}_e = 0) \\ \frac{\mathbf{N}_e}{\mathbf{D}_o + \mathbf{D}_e}, & (\mathbf{N}_o = 0) \end{array} \right. \tag{19.84}
$$

and can rewrite this as

$$
\mathbf{H}(s) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}\frac{\mathbf{N}_o / \mathbf{D}_e}{1 + \mathbf{D}_o / \mathbf{D}_e}, & (\mathbf{N}_e = 0) \\ \frac{\mathbf{N}_e / \mathbf{D}_o}{1 + \mathbf{D}_e / \mathbf{D}_o}, & (\mathbf{N}_o = 0) \end{array} \right. \tag{19.85}
$$

Comparing this with Eq. (19.82), we obtain the  $y$  parameters of the network as

$$
\frac{\mathbf{y}_{21}}{\mathbf{Y}_L} = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}\frac{\mathbf{N}_o}{\mathbf{D}_e}, & (\mathbf{N}_e = 0) \\ \frac{\mathbf{N}_e}{\mathbf{D}_o}, & (\mathbf{N}_o = 0) \end{array} \right. \tag{19.86}
$$

and

$$
\frac{\mathbf{y}_{22}}{\mathbf{Y}_L} = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}\frac{\mathbf{D}_o}{\mathbf{D}_e}, & (\mathbf{N}_e = 0) \\ \frac{\mathbf{D}_e}{\mathbf{D}_o}, & (\mathbf{N}_o = 0) \end{array} \right. \tag{19.87}
$$

The following example illustrates the procedure.

Design the  $LC$  ladder network terminated with a  $1 - \Omega$  resistor that has the normalized transfer function

$$
\mathbf{H}(s) = \frac{1}{s^3 + 2s^2 + 2s + 1}
$$

(This transfer function is for a Butterworth low- pass filter.)

# Solution:

The denominator shows that this is a third- order network, so that the  $LC$  ladder network is shown in Fig. 19.63(a), with two inductors and one capacitor. Our goal is to determine the values of the inductors and

capacitor. To achieve this, we group the terms in the denominator into odd or even parts:

$$
\mathbf{D}(s) = (s^{3} + 2s) + (2s^{2} + 1)
$$

so that

$$
\mathbf{H}(s) = \frac{1}{(s^{3} + 2s) + (2s^{2} + 1)}
$$

Divide the numerator and denominator by the odd part of the denominator to get

$$
\mathbf{H}(s) = \frac{\frac{1}{s^{3} + 2s}}{1 + \frac{2s^{2} + 1}{s^{3} + 2s}} \tag{19.18.1}
$$

From Eq. (19.82), when  $\mathbf{Y}_{L} = 1$

$$
\mathbf{H}(s) = \frac{-y_{21}}{1 + y_{22}} \tag{19.18.2}
$$

Comparing Eqs. (19.19.1) and (19.19.2), we obtain

$$
y_{21} = \frac{1}{s^{3} + 2s},\qquad y_{22} = \frac{2s^{2} + 1}{s^{3} + 2s}
$$

Any realization of  $y_{22}$  will automatically realize  $y_{21}$ , since  $y_{22}$  is the output driving- point admittance, that is, the output admittance of the network with the input port short- circuited. We determine the values of  $L$  and  $C$  in Fig. 19.63(a) that will give us  $y_{22}$ . Recall that  $y_{22}$  is the short- circuit output admittance. So we short- circuit the input port as shown in Fig. 19.63(b). First we get  $L_{3}$  by letting

$$
Z_{A} = \frac{1}{y_{22}} = \frac{s^{3} + 2s}{2s^{2} + 1} = sL_{3} + Z_{B} \tag{19.18.3}
$$

By long division,

$$
Z_{A} = 0.5s + \frac{1.5s}{2s^{2} + 1} \tag{19.18.4}
$$

Comparing Eqs. (19.18.3) and (19.18.4) shows that

$$
L_{3} = 0.5\mathrm{H},\qquad Z_{B} = \frac{1.5s}{2s^{2} + 1}
$$

Next, we seek to get  $C_{2}$  as in Fig. 19.63(c) and let

$$
Y_{B} = \frac{1}{Z_{B}} = \frac{2s^{2} + 1}{1.5s} = 1.333s + \frac{1}{1.5s} = sC_{2} + Y_{C}
$$

from which  $C_{2} = 1.33\mathrm{F}$  and

$$
Y_{C} = \frac{1}{1.5s} = \frac{1}{sL_{1}}\qquad \Rightarrow \qquad L_{1} = 1.5\mathrm{H}
$$

Thus, the  $LC$  ladder network in Fig. 19.63(a) with  $L_{1} = 1.5\mathrm{H}$ ,  $C_{2} = 1.333\mathrm{F}$ , and  $L_{3} = 0.5\mathrm{H}$  has been synthesized to provide the given transfer function  $\mathbf{H}(s)$ . This result can be confirmed by finding  $\mathbf{H}(s) = \mathbf{V}_{2} / \mathbf{V}_{1}$  in Fig. 19.63(a) or by confirming the required  $y_{21}$ .

Realize the following transfer function using an  $LC$  ladder network terminated in a  $1 - \Omega$  resistor:

$$
H(s) = \frac{2}{s^3 + s^2 + 4s + 2}
$$

Answer: Ladder network in Fig. 19.63(a) with  $L_{1} = L_{2} = 1.0 \mathrm{H}$  and  $C_{2} = 500 \mathrm{mF}$ .

# 19.10 Summary

1. A two-port network is one with two ports (or two pairs of access terminals), known as input and output ports.

2. The six parameters used to model a two-port network are the impedance  $[\mathbf{z}]$ , admittance  $[\mathbf{y}]$ , hybrid  $[\mathbf{h}]$ , inverse hybrid  $[\mathbf{g}]$ , transmission  $[\mathbf{T}]$ , and inverse transmission  $[\mathbf{t}]$  parameters.

3. The parameters relate the input and output port variables as

$$
\begin{array}{r}[{\bf V}_1] = [{\bf z}][{\bf I}_1],\qquad [{\bf I}_1] = [{\bf y}][{\bf V}_1],\qquad [{\bf V}_1] = [{\bf h}][{\bf I}_1]\\ {\bf V}_2] = [{\bf g}][{\bf V}_1],\qquad [{\bf V}_1] = [{\bf T}][{\bf V}_2],\qquad [{\bf V}_2] = [{\bf t}][{\bf V}_1] \end{array}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{r}[{\bf I}_1] = [{\bf g}][{\bf V}_1],\qquad [{\bf V}_1] = [{\bf T}][{\bf V}_2],\qquad [{\bf V}_2] = [{\bf t}][{\bf V}_1]\\ {\bf V}_2] = [{\bf g}][{\bf I}_2],\qquad [{\bf I}_1] = [{\bf T}][-{\bf I}_2],\qquad [{\bf I}_2] = [{\bf t}][-{\bf I}_1] \end{array}
$$

4. The parameters can be calculated or measured by short-circuiting or open-circuiting the appropriate input or output port.

5. A two-port network is reciprocal if  $\mathbf{z}_{12} = \mathbf{z}_{21}$ ,  $\mathbf{y}_{12} = \mathbf{y}_{21}$ ,  $\mathbf{h}_{12} = -\mathbf{h}_{21}$ ,  $\mathbf{g}_{12} = -\mathbf{g}_{21}$ ,  $\Delta_{T} = 1$  or  $\Delta_{t} = 1$ . Networks that have dependent sources are not reciprocal.

6. Table 19.1 provides the relationships between the six sets of parameters. Three important relationships are

$$
[\mathbf{y}] = [\mathbf{z}]^{-1},\qquad [\mathbf{g}] = [\mathbf{h}]^{-1},\qquad [\mathbf{t}]\neq [\mathbf{T}]^{-1}
$$

7. Two-port networks may be connected in series, in parallel, or in cascade. In the series connection the  $z$  parameters are added, in the parallel connection the  $y$  parameters are added, and in the cascade connection the transmission parameters are multiplied in the correct order.

8. One can use PSpice to compute the two-port parameters by constraining the appropriate port variables with a 1-A or 1-V source while using an open or short circuit to impose the other necessary constraints.

9. The network parameters are specifically applied in the analysis of transistor circuits and the synthesis of ladder  $LC$  networks. Network parameters are especially useful in the analysis of transistor circuits because these circuits are easily modeled as two-port networks.  $LC$  ladder networks, important in the design of passive low-pass filters, resemble cascaded T networks and are therefore best analyzed as two-ports.

# Appendix A

# Simultaneous Equations and Matrix Inversion

In circuit analysis, we often encounter a set of simultaneous equations having the form

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{a_{11}x_{1}+a_{12}x_{2}+\cdots+a_{1n}x_{n}=b_{1}}}\\ {{a_{21}x_{1}+a_{22}x_{2}+\cdots+a_{2n}x_{n}=b_{2}}}\\ {{\vdots\qquad\vdots\qquad\vdots}}\\ {{a_{n1}x_{1}+a_{n2}x_{2}+\cdots+a_{nn}x_{n}=b_{n}}}\end{array} \tag{A.1}
$$

(A.1)

where there are  $n$  unknown  $x_{1}, x_{2}, \ldots , x_{n}$  to be determined. Equation (A.1) can be written in matrix form as

$$
\begin{array}{r}{\left[ \begin{array}{c c c c}{a_{11}} & {a_{12}} & \dots & {a_{1n}}\\ {a_{21}} & {a_{22}} & \dots & {a_{2n}}\\ \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\ {a_{n1}} & {a_{n2}} & \dots & {a_{n n}} \end{array} \right]\left[ \begin{array}{c}{x_{1}}\\ {x_{2}}\\ \vdots \\ {x_{n}} \end{array} \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{c}{b_{2}}\\ {b_{2}}\\ \vdots \\ {b_{n}} \end{array} \right]} \end{array} \tag{A.2}
$$

This matrix equation can be put in a compact form as

$$
\mathbf{A}\mathbf{X} = \mathbf{B} \tag{A.3}
$$

where

$$
\mathbf{A} = \left[ \begin{array}{c c c c}{a_{11}} & {a_{12}} & \dots & {a_{1n}}\\ {a_{21}} & {a_{22}} & \dots & {a_{2n}}\\ \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\ {a_{n1}} & {a_{n2}} & \dots & {a_{n n}} \right],\quad \mathbf{X} = \left[ \begin{array}{c}{x_{1}}\\ {x_{2}}\\ \vdots \\ {x_{n}} \end{array} \right],\quad \mathbf{B} = \left[ \begin{array}{c}{b_{1}}\\ {b_{2}}\\ \vdots \\ {b_{n}} \end{array} \right] \tag{A.3}
$$

A is a square  $(n \times n)$  matrix while  $\mathbf{X}$  and  $\mathbf{B}$  are column matrices.

There are several methods for solving Eq. (A.1) or (A.3). These include substitution, Gaussian elimination, Cramer's rule, matrix inversion, and numerical analysis.

# A.1 Cramer's Rule

In many cases, Cramer's rule can be used to solve the simultaneous equations we encounter in circuit analysis. Cramer's rule states that the solution to Eq. (A.1) or (A.3) is

$$
\begin{array}{r}{x_{1} = \frac{\Delta_{1}}{\Delta}}\\ {x_{2} = \frac{\Delta_{2}}{\Delta}}\\ {\vdots}\\ {x_{n} = \frac{\Delta_{n}}{\Delta}} \end{array} \tag{A.5}
$$

where the  $\Delta$  's are the determinants given by

$$
\Delta = \left| \begin{array}{cccc}a_{11} & a_{12} & \dots & a_{1n}\\ a_{21} & a_{22} & \dots & a_{2n}\\ \vdots & \vdots & \dots & \vdots \\ a_{n1} & a_{n2} & \dots & a_{nn} \end{array} \right|,\qquad \Delta_{1} = \left| \begin{array}{cccc}b_{1} & a_{12} & \dots & a_{1n}\\ b_{2} & a_{22} & \dots & a_{2n}\\ \vdots & \vdots & \dots & \vdots \\ b_{n} & a_{n2} & \dots & a_{nn} \end{array} \right|
$$

$$
\Delta_{2} = \left| \begin{array}{cccc}a_{11} & b_{1} & \dots & a_{1n}\\ a_{21} & b_{2} & \dots & a_{2n}\\ \vdots & \vdots & \dots & \vdots \\ a_{n1} & b_{n} & \dots & a_{nn} \end{array} \right|,\ldots ,\Delta_{n} = \left| \begin{array}{cccc}a_{11} & a_{12} & \dots & b_{1}\\ a_{21} & a_{22} & \dots & b_{2}\\ \vdots & \vdots & \dots & \vdots \\ a_{n1} & a_{n2} & \dots & b_{n} \end{array} \right|
$$

Notice that  $\Delta$  is the determinant of matrix A and  $\Delta_{k}$  is the determinant of the matrix formed by replacing the  $k$ th column of  $\mathbf{A}$  by  $\mathbf{B}$ . It is evident from Eq. (A.5) that Cramer's rule applies only when  $\Delta \neq 0$ . When  $\Delta = 0$ , the set of equations has no unique solution, because the equations are linearly dependent.

The value of the determinant  $\Delta$ , for example, can be obtained by expanding along the first row:

$$
\Delta = \left| \begin{array}{cccc}a_{11} & a_{12} & a_{13} & \dots & a_{1n}\\ a_{21} & a_{22} & a_{23} & \dots & a_{2n}\\ \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \dots & \vdots \\ a_{n1} & a_{n2} & a_{n3} & \dots & a_{nn} \end{array} \right| \tag{A.7}
$$

$$
= a_{11}M_{11} - a_{12}M_{12} + a_{13}M_{13} + \dots +(-1)^{n + 1}a_{1n}M_{1n}
$$

where the minor  $M_{ij}$  is an  $(n - 1) \times (n - 1)$  determinant of the matrix formed by striking out the  $i$ th row and  $j$ th column. The value of  $\Delta$  may also be obtained by expanding along the first column:

$$
\Delta = a_{11}M_{11} - a_{21}M_{21} + a_{31}M_{31} + \dots +(-1)^{n + 1}a_{n1}M_{n1} \tag{A.8}
$$

We now specifically develop the formulas for calculating the determinants of  $2 \times 2$  and  $3 \times 3$  matrices, because of their frequent occurrence in this text. For a  $2 \times 2$  matrix,

$$
\Delta = \left| \begin{array}{cc}a_{11} & a_{12}\\ a_{21} & a_{22} \end{array} \right| = a_{11}a_{22} - a_{12}a_{21} \tag{A.9}
$$

For a  $3 \times 3$  matrix,

$$
\begin{array}{r l} & {\Delta = \left| \begin{array}{l l l}{a_{11}} & {a_{12}} & {a_{13}}\\ {a_{21}} & {a_{22}} & {a_{23}}\\ {a_{31}} & {a_{32}} & {a_{33}} \end{array} \right| = a_{11}(-1)^{2}\left| \begin{array}{l l}{a_{22}} & {a_{23}}\\ {a_{32}} & {a_{33}} \end{array} \right| + a_{21}(-1)^{3}\left| \begin{array}{l l}{a_{12}} & {a_{13}}\\ {a_{32}} & {a_{33}} \end{array} \right|}\\ & {\qquad +a_{31}(-1)^{4}\left| \begin{array}{l l}{a_{12}} & {a_{13}}\\ {a_{22}} & {a_{23}} \end{array} \right|}\\ & {\qquad = a_{11}(a_{22}a_{33} - a_{32}a_{23}) - a_{21}(a_{12}a_{33} - a_{32}a_{13})}\\ & {\qquad +a_{31}(a_{12}a_{23} - a_{22}a_{13})} \end{array} \tag{A.10}
$$

An alternative method of obtaining the determinant of a  $3 \times 3$  matrix is by repeating the first two rows and multiplying the terms diagonally as follows.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-14/63c420e9-9220-47ad-935a-09e6b2aeb2a8/0361299f66f5dee70c2cce4ea132a80d0ca95265d56a5b988673b99575374623.jpg)

In summary:

The solution of linear simultaneous equations by Cramer's rule boils down to finding

$$
x_{k} = \frac{\Delta_{k}}{\Delta},\qquad k = 1,2,\ldots ,n \tag{A.12}
$$

where  $\Delta$  is the determinant of matrix  $\mathbf{A}$  and  $\Delta_{k}$  is the determinant of the matrix formed by replacing the  $k$ th column of  $\mathbf{A}$  by  $\mathbf{B}$ .

One may use other methods, such as matrix inversion and elimination. Only Cramer's method is covered here, because of its simplicity and also because of the availability of powerful calculators.

You may not find much need to use Cramer's method described in this appendix, in view of the availability of calculators, computers, and software packages such as MATLAB, which can be used easily to solve a set of linear equations. But in case you need to solve the equations by hand, the material covered in this appendix becomes useful. At any rate, it is important to know the mathematical basis of those calculators and software packages.

# Example A.1

Solve the simultaneous equations

$$
4x_{1} - 3x_{2} = 17, \qquad -3x_{1} + 5x_{2} = -21
$$

# Solution:

The given set of equations is cast in matrix form as

$$
\left[ \begin{array}{cc}4 & -3 \\ -3 & 5 \end{array} \right] \left[ \begin{array}{c}x_{1} \\ x_{2} \end{array} \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{c}17 \\ -21 \end{array} \right]
$$

The determinants are evaluated as

$$
\Delta = \left| \begin{array}{cc}4 & -3 \\ -3 & 5 \end{array} \right| = 4 \times 5 - (-3)(-3) = 11
$$

$$
\Delta_{1} = \left| \begin{array}{cc}17 & -3 \\ -21 & 5 \end{array} \right| = 17 \times 5 - (-3)(-21) = 22
$$

$$
\Delta_{2} = \left| \begin{array}{cc}4 & 17 \\ -3 & -21 \end{array} \right| = 4 \times (-21) - 17 \times (-3) = -33
$$

Hence,

$$
x_{1} = \frac{\Delta_{1}}{\Delta} = \frac{22}{11} = 2, \qquad x_{2} = \frac{\Delta_{2}}{\Delta} = \frac{-33}{11} = -3
$$

Find the solution to the following simultaneous equations:

$$
3x_{1} - x_{2} = 4, \qquad -6x_{1} + 18x_{2} = 16
$$

Answer:  $x_{1} = 1.833$ ,  $x_{2} = 1.5$

Determine  $x_{1}$ ,  $x_{2}$ , and  $x_{3}$  for this set of simultaneous equations:

$$
\begin{array}{r}25x_{1} - 5x_{2} - 20x_{3} = 50 \\ -5x_{1} + 10x_{2} - 4x_{3} = 0 \\ -5x_{1} - 4x_{2} + 9x_{3} = 0 \end{array}
$$

# Solution:

In matrix form, the given set of equations becomes

$$
\left[ \begin{array}{rrr}25 & -5 & -20 \\ -5 & 10 & -4 \\ -5 & -4 & 9 \end{array} \right]\left[ \begin{array}{l}x_{1} \\ x_{2} \\ x_{3} \end{array} \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{l}50 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{array} \right]
$$

We apply Eq. (A.11) to find the determinants. This requires that we repeat the first two rows of the matrix. Thus,

$$
\Delta = \left| \begin{array}{rrr}25 & -5 & -20 \\ -5 & 10 & -4 \\ -5 & -4 & 9 \end{array} \right| = \left| \begin{array}{r}25 - 5 - 20 \\ -5 - 10 - 4 \\ -5 - 4 - 9 \\ -5 - 5 - 20 \\ -5 - 10 - 4 \\ -5 - 10 - 4 \end{array} \right| + \left| \begin{array}{r}25 - 5 - 20 \\ -5 - 10 - 4 \\ -5 - 4 - 9 \\ -5 - 10 - 4 \\ -5 - 10 - 4 \end{array} \right|.
$$

$$
\begin{array}{rl} & = 25(10)9 + (-5)(-4)(-20) + (-5)(-5)(-4) \\ & \quad -(-20)(10)(-5) - (-4)(-4)25 - 9(-5)(-5) \\ & = 2250 - 400 - 100 - 1000 - 400 - 225 = 125 \end{array}
$$

Similarly,

$$
\Delta_{1} = \left| \begin{array}{rrr}50 & -5 & -20 \\ 0 & 10 & -4 \\ 0 & -4 & 9 \end{array} \right| = \left| \begin{array}{r}50 - 5 - 20 \\ 0 - 10 - 4 \\ 0 - 4 - 9 \\ 50 - 5 - 20 \\ 0 - 10 - 4 \\ 0 - 10 - 4 \end{array} \right| + \left| \begin{array}{r}50 - 5 - 20 \\ 0 - 10 - 4 \\ 0 - 10 - 4 \\ 0 - 10 - 4 \\ 0 - 10 - 4 \end{array} \right|.
$$

$$
= 4500 + 0 + 0 - 0 - 800 - 0 = 3700
$$

$$
= 0 + 0 + 1000 - 0 - 0 + 2250 = 3250
$$

$$
\Delta_{3} = \left| \begin{array}{ccc}25 & -5 & 50 \\ -5 & 10 & 0 \\ -5 & -4 & 0 \end{array} \right| = \left| \begin{array}{ccc}25 & -5 & 50 \\ -5 & -4 & 0 \\ -5 & -4 & 0 \end{array} \right| + \left| \begin{array}{ccc}25 & -5 & 50 \\ -5 & -4 & 0 \\ -5 & -4 & 0 \end{array} \right| + \left| \begin{array}{ccc}25 & -5 & 50 \\ -5 & -4 & 0 \\ -5 & -4 & 0 \end{array} \right| + \left| \begin{array}{}\\ -5 & -4 & 0 \\ -5 & -4 & 0 \end{array} \right| + \left| \begin{array}{}\\ -5 & -4 & 0 \\ -5 & -4 & 0 \end{array} \right| + \left| \begin{array}{}\\ -5 & -4 & 0 \\ -5 & -4 & 0 \end{array} \right| + \frac{1}{-5} \left| \begin{array}{}\\ -5 & -4 & 0 \\ -5 & -4 & 0 \end{array} \right| + \frac{1}{-5} \left| \begin{array}{}\\ -5 & -4 & 0 \\ -5 & -4 & 0 \end{array} \right| + \frac{1}{-5} \left| \begin{array}{}\\ -4 & 0 \\ -5 & -4 & 0 \end{array} \right| + \frac{1}{-5} \left| \begin{array}{}\\ -4 & 0 \\ -5 & -4 & 0 \end{array} \right| + \frac{1}{-5} \left| \begin{array}{}\\ -4 & 0 \\ -5 & -4 & 0 \end{ array} \right| + \frac{1}{-5} \left| \begin{array}{}\\ -4 & 0 \\ -5 & -4 & 0 \end{array} \right| + \frac{1}{-5} \left| \begin{array}{}\\ -4 & 0 \\ -5 & -4 & 0 \end{array} \right| + \frac{1}{-5} \left| \right| \end{array}
$$

$$
= 0 + 1000 + 0 + 2500 - 0 - 0 = 3500
$$

Hence, we now find

$$
\begin{array}{l}x_{1} = \frac{\Delta_{1}}{\Delta} = \frac{3700}{125} = 29.6 \\ x_{2} = \frac{\Delta_{2}}{\Delta} = \frac{3250}{125} = 26 \\ x_{3} = \frac{\Delta_{2}}{\Delta} = \frac{3500}{125} = 28 \end{array}
$$

Practice Problem A.2 Obtain the solution of this set of simultaneous equations:

$$
\begin{array}{r}3x_{1} - x_{2} - 2x_{3} = 1 \\ -x_{1} + 6x_{2} - 3x_{3} = 0 \\ -2x_{1} - 3x_{2} + 6x_{3} = 6 \end{array}
$$

Answer:  $x_{1} = 3 = x_{3}, x_{2} = 2$ .

# A.2 Matrix Inversion

The linear system of equations in Eq. (A.3) can be solved by matrix inversion. In the matrix equation  $\mathbf{A} \mathbf{X} = \mathbf{B}$ , we may invert  $\mathbf{A}$  to get  $\mathbf{X}$ , i.e.,

$$
\mathbf{X} = \mathbf{A}^{-1} \mathbf{B} \tag{A.13}
$$

where  $\mathbf{A}^{- 1}$  is the inverse of  $\mathbf{A}$ . Matrix inversion is needed in other applications apart from using it to solve a set of equations.

By definition, the inverse of matrix  $\mathbf{A}$  satisfies

$$
\mathbf{A}^{-1} \mathbf{A} = \mathbf{A} \mathbf{A}^{-1} = \mathbf{I} \tag{A.14}
$$

where  $\mathbf{I}$  is an identity matrix.  $\mathbf{A}^{- 1}$  is given by

$$
\mathbf{A}^{-1} = \frac{\operatorname{adj}\mathbf{A}}{\operatorname{det}\mathbf{A}} \tag{A.15}
$$

where adj  $\mathbf{A}$  is the adjoint of  $\mathbf{A}$  and det  $\mathbf{A} = |\mathbf{A}|$  is the determinant of  $\mathbf{A}$ . The adjoint of  $\mathbf{A}$  is the transpose of the cofactors of  $\mathbf{A}$ . Suppose we are given an  $n\times n$  matrix  $\mathbf{A}$  as

$$
\mathbf{A} = \left[ \begin{array}{c c c c}{a_{11}} & {a_{12}} & \dots & {a_{1n}}\\ {a_{21}} & {a_{22}} & \dots & {a_{2n}}\\ \vdots & & & \\ {a_{n1}} & {a_{n2}} & \dots & {a_{n n}} \end{array} \right] \tag{A.16}
$$

The cofactors of  $\mathbf{A}$  are defined as

$$
\mathbf{C} = \operatorname {cof}\left(\mathbf{A}\right) = \left[ \begin{array}{c c c c}{c_{11}} & {c_{12}} & \dots & {c_{1n}}\\ {c_{21}} & {c_{22}} & \dots & {c_{2n}}\\ \vdots & & & \\ {c_{n1}} & {c_{n2}} & \dots & {c_{n n}} \end{array} \right] \tag{A.17}
$$

where the cofactor  $c_{ij}$  is the product of  $(- 1)^{i + j}$  and the determinant of the  $(n - 1)\times (n - 1)$  submatrix is obtained by deleting the  $i$ th row and  $j$ th column from  $\mathbf{A}$ . For example, by deleting the first row and the first column of  $\mathbf{A}$  in Eq. (A.16), we obtain the cofactor  $c_{11}$  as

$$
c_{11} = (-1)^{T}\left[ \begin{array}{l l l l}{a_{22}} & {a_{23}} & \dots & {a_{2n}}\\ {a_{32}} & {a_{33}} & \dots & {a_{3n}}\\ \vdots & & & \\ {a_{n2}} & {a_{n3}} & \dots & {a_{n n}} \end{array} \right] \tag{A.18}
$$

Once the cofactors are found, the adjoint of  $\mathbf{A}$  is obtained as

$$
\operatorname {adj}\left(\mathbf{A}\right) = \left[ \begin{array}{c c c c}{c_{11}} & {c_{12}} & \dots & {c_{1n}}\\ {c_{21}} & {c_{22}} & \dots & {c_{2n}}\\ \vdots & & & \\ {c_{n1}} & {c_{n2}} & \dots & {c_{n}} \end{array} \right]^{T} = \mathbf{C}^{T} \tag{A.19}
$$

where  $T$  denotes transpose.

In addition to using the cofactors to find the adjoint of  $\mathbf{A}$ , they are also used in finding the determinant of  $\mathbf{A}$  which is given by

$$
|\mathbf{A}| = \sum_{j = 1}^{n}a_{ij}c_{ij} \tag{A.20}
$$

where  $i$  is any value from 1 to  $n$ . By substituting Eqs. (A.19) and (A.20) into Eq. (A.15), we obtain the inverse of  $\mathbf{A}$  as

$$
\mathbf{A}^{-1} = \frac{\mathbf{C}^{T}}{|\mathbf{A}|} \tag{A.21}
$$

For a  $2\times 2$  matrix, if

$$
\mathbf{A} = \left[ \begin{array}{ll}a & b \\ c & d \end{array} \right] \tag{A.22}
$$

its inverse is

$$
\mathbf{A}^{-1} = \frac{1}{|\mathbf{A}|}\left[ \begin{array}{cc}d & -b \\ -c & a \end{array} \right] = \frac{1}{ad - bc}\left[ \begin{array}{cc}d & -b \\ -c & a \end{array} \right] \tag{A.23}
$$

For a  $3 \times 3$  matrix, if

$$
\mathbf{A} = \left[ \begin{array}{lll}a_{11} & a_{12} & a_{13} \\ a_{21} & a_{22} & a_{23} \\ a_{31} & a_{32} & a_{33} \end{array} \right] \tag{A.24}
$$

we first obtain the cofactors as

$$
\mathbf{C} = \left[ \begin{array}{lll}c_{11} & c_{12} & c_{13} \\ c_{21} & c_{22} & c_{23} \\ c_{31} & c_{32} & c_{33} \end{array} \right] \tag{A.25}
$$

where

$$
\begin{array}{r l r l} & {c_{11} = \left| \begin{array}{l l}{a_{22}} & {a_{23}}\\ {a_{32}} & {a_{33}} \end{array} \right|,\qquad} & {c_{12} = -\left| \begin{array}{l l}{a_{21}} & {a_{23}}\\ {a_{31}} & {a_{33}} \end{array} \right|,\quad c_{13} = \left| \begin{array}{l l}{a_{21}} & {a_{22}}\\ {a_{31}} & {a_{32}} \end{array} \right|,}\\ & {c_{21} = -\left| \begin{array}{l l}{a_{12}} & {a_{13}}\\ {a_{32}} & {a_{33}} \end{array} \right|,\qquad} & {c_{22} = \left| \begin{array}{l l}{a_{11}} & {a_{13}}\\ {a_{31}} & {a_{33}} \end{array} \right|,\qquad} & {c_{23} = -\left| \begin{array}{l l}{a_{11}} & {a_{12}}\\ {a_{31}} & {a_{32}} \end{array} \right|,}\\ & {c_{31} = \left| \begin{array}{l l}{a_{12}} & {a_{13}}\\ {a_{22}} & {a_{23}} \end{array} \right|,\qquad} & {c_{32} = -\left| \begin{array}{l l}{a_{11}} & {a_{13}}\\ {a_{21}} & {a_{23}} \end{array} \right|,\qquad} & {c_{33} = \left| \begin{array}{l l}{a_{11}} & {a_{12}}\\ {a_{21}} & {a_{22}} \end{array} \right|} \end{array}
$$

(A.26)

The determinant of the  $3 \times 3$  matrix can be found using Eq. (A.11). Here, we want to use Eq. (A.20), i.e.,

$$
|\mathbf{A}| = a_{11}c_{11} + a_{12}c_{12} + a_{13}c_{13} \tag{A.27}
$$

The idea can be extended  $n > 3$ , but we deal mainly with  $2 \times 2$  and  $3 \times 3$  matrices in this book.

Example A.3 Use matrix inversion to solve the simultaneous equations

$$
2x_{1} + 10x_{2} = 2, \qquad -x_{1} + 3x_{2} = 7
$$

# Solution:

We first express the two equations in matrix form as

$$
\left[ \begin{array}{cc}2 & 10 \\ -1 & 3 \end{array} \right]\left[ \begin{array}{c}x_{1} \\ x_{2} \end{array} \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{c}2 \\ 7 \end{array} \right]
$$

or

$$
\mathbf{A}\mathbf{X} = \mathbf{B} \longrightarrow \mathbf{X} = \mathbf{A}^{-1}\mathbf{B}
$$

where

$$
\mathbf{A} = \left[ \begin{array}{cc}2 & 10 \\ -1 & 3 \end{array} \right], \qquad \mathbf{X} = \left[ \begin{array}{c}x_{1} \\ x_{2} \end{array} \right], \qquad \mathbf{B} = \left[ \begin{array}{c}2 \\ 7 \end{array} \right]
$$

The determinant of  $\mathbf{A}$  is  $|\mathbf{A}| = 2 \times 3 - 10(- 1) = 16$ , so the inverse of  $\mathbf{A}$  is

$$
\mathbf{A}^{-1} = \frac{1}{16}\left[ \begin{array}{cc}3 & -10 \\ 1 & 2 \end{array} \right]
$$

Hence,

$$
\mathbf{X} = \mathbf{A}^{-1}\mathbf{B} = \frac{1}{16}\left[ \begin{array}{cc}3 & -10\\ 1 & 2 \end{array} \right]\left[ \begin{array}{c}2\\ 7 \end{array} \right] = \frac{1}{16}\left[ \begin{array}{c} - 64\\ 16 \end{array} \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{c} - 4\\ 1 \end{array} \right]
$$

i.e.,  $x_{1} = - 4$  and  $x_{2} = 1$

Solve the following two equations by matrix inversion.

Practice Problem A.3

$$
2y_{1} - y_{2} = 4,\quad y_{1} + 3y_{2} = 9
$$

Answer:  $y_{1} = 3, y_{2} = 2$

Determine  $x_{1}, x_{2}$ , and  $x_{3}$  for the following simultaneous equations using matrix inversion.

$$
\begin{array}{c}{x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 5}\\ {-x_1 + 2x_2 = 9}\\ {4x_1 + x_2 - x_3 = -2} \end{array}
$$

# Solution:

In matrix form, the equations become

$$
\left[ \begin{array}{rrr}1 & 1 & 1\\ -1 & 2 & 0\\ 4 & 1 & -1 \end{array} \right]\left[ \begin{array}{r}x_{1}\\ x_{2}\\ x_{3} \end{array} \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{r}5\\ 9\\ -2 \end{array} \right]
$$

or

$$
\mathbf{A}\mathbf{X} = \mathbf{B}\longrightarrow \mathbf{X} = \mathbf{A}^{-1}\mathbf{B}
$$

where

$$
\mathbf{A} = \left[ \begin{array}{ccc}1 & 1 & 1\\ -1 & 2 & 0\\ 4 & 1 & -1 \end{array} \right],\qquad \mathbf{X} = \left[ \begin{array}{c}x_{1}\\ x_{2}\\ x_{3} \end{array} \right],\qquad \mathbf{B} = \left[ \begin{array}{c}5\\ 9\\ -2 \end{array} \right]
$$

We now find the cofactors

$$
\begin{array}{l}{{c_{11}=\left|{\begin{array}{c c}{{2}}&{{0}}\\ {{1}}&{{-1}}\end{array}}\right|=-2,\quad c_{12}=-\left|{\begin{array}{c c}{{-1}}&{{0}}\\ {{4}}&{{-1}}\end{array}}\right|=-1,\quad c_{13}=\left|{\begin{array}{c c}{{-1}}&{{2}}\\ {{4}}&{{1}}\end{array}}\right|=-9}}\\ {{c_{21}=-\left|{\begin{array}{c c}{{1}}&{{1}}\\ {{1}}&{{-1}}\end{array}}\right|=2,\quad c_{22}=\left|{\begin{array}{c c}{{1}}&{{1}}\\ {{4}}&{{-1}}\end{array}}\right|=-5,\qquad c_{23}=-\left|{\begin{array}{c c}{{1}}&{{1}}\\ {{4}}&{{1}}\end{array}}\right|=3}}\\ {{c_{31}=\left|{\begin{array}{c c}{{1}}&{{1}}\\ {{2}}&{{0}}\end{array}}\right|=-2,\quad c_{32}=-\left|{\begin{array}{c c}{{1}}&{{1}}\\ {{-1}}&{{0}}\end{array}}\right|=-1,\qquad c_{33}=\left|{\begin{array}{c c}{{1}}&{{1}}\\ {{-1}}&{{2}}\end{array}}\right|=3}}\end{array}
$$

The adjoint of matrix A is

$$
\operatorname {adj}\mathbf{A}={\left[\begin{array}{l l l}{-2}&{-1}&{-9}\\ {2}&{-5}&{3}\\ {-2}&{-1}&{3}\end{array}\right]}^{T}={\left[\begin{array}{l l l}{-2}&{2}&{-2}\\ {-1}&{-5}&{-1}\\ {-9}&{3}&{3}\end{array}\right]}
$$

We can find the determinant of A using any row or column of A. Because one element of the second row is 0, we can take advantage of this to find the determinant as

$$
|\mathbf{A}| = -1c_{21} + 2c_{22} + (0)c_{23} = -1(2) + 2(-5) = -12
$$

Hence, the inverse of A is

$$
\mathbf{A}^{-1} = \frac{1}{-12}\left[ \begin{array}{ccc} - 2 & 2 & -2 \\ -1 & -5 & -1 \\ -9 & 3 & 3 \end{array} \right]
$$

$$
\mathbf{X} = \mathbf{A}^{-1}\mathbf{B} = \frac{1}{-12}\left[ \begin{array}{ccc} - 2 & 2 & -2 \\ -1 & -5 & -1 \\ -9 & 3 & 3 \end{array} \right]\left[ \begin{array}{c}5 \\ 9 \\ -2 \end{array} \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{c} - 1 \\ 4 \\ 2 \end{array} \right]
$$

i.e.,  $x_{1} = -1$ ,  $x_{2} = 4$ ,  $x_{3} = 2$ .

Practice Problem A.4 Solve the following equations using matrix inversion.

$$
\begin{array}{r}y_{1} - y_{3} = 1 \\ 2y_{1} + 3y_{2} - y_{3} = 1 \\ y_{1} - y_{2} - y_{3} = 3 \end{array}
$$

Answer:  $y_{1} = 6$ ,  $y_{2} = - 2$ ,  $y_{3} = 5$ .

# Appendix B

# Complex Numbers

The ability to manipulate complex numbers is very handy in circuit analysis and in electrical engineering in general. Complex numbers are particularly useful in the analysis of ac circuits. Again, although calculators and computer software packages are now available to manipulate complex numbers, it is still advisable for a student to be familiar with how to handle them by hand.

# B.1 Representations of Complex Numbers

A complex number  $z$  may be written in rectangular form as

$$
z = x + jy \tag{B.1}
$$

where  $j = \sqrt{- 1}$ ;  $x$  is the real part of  $z$  while  $y$  is the imaginary part of  $z$ ; that is,

$$
x = \operatorname {Re}(z),\qquad y = \operatorname {Im}(z) \tag{B.2}
$$

The complex number  $z$  is shown plotted in the complex plane in Fig. B.1. Because  $j = \sqrt{- 1}$ ,

$$
\begin{array}{c}\frac{1}{j} = -j \\ j^2 = -1 \\ j^3 = j\cdot j^2 = -j \\ j^4 = j^2\cdot j^2 = 1 \\ j^5 = j\cdot j^4 = j \\ \vdots \\ j^{n + 4} = j^n \end{array} \tag{B.3}
$$

A second way of representing the complex number  $z$  is by specifying its magnitude  $r$  and the angle  $\theta$  it makes with the real axis, as Fig. B.1 shows. This is known as the polar form. It is given by

$$
z = |z| / \theta = r / \theta \tag{B.4}
$$

where

$$
r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2},\qquad \theta = \tan^{-1}\frac{y}{x} \tag{B.5a}
$$

or

$$
x = r\cos \theta ,\qquad y = r\sin \theta \tag{B.5b}
$$

that is,

$$
z = x + jy = r / \theta = r\cos \theta +jr\sin \theta \tag{B.6}
$$

The complex plane looks like the two- dimensional curvilinear coordinatespace, but it is not.

Figure B.1 Graphical representation of a complex number.

In converting from rectangular to polar form using Eq. (B.5), we must exercise care in determining the correct value of  $\theta$ . These are the four possibilities:

$$
\begin{array}{r l r l} & {z = x + j y,} & {\theta = \tan^{-1}\frac{y}{x}} & {\mathrm{(1st~Quadrant)}}\\ & {} & {}\\ & {z = -x + j y,} & {\theta = 180^{\circ} - \tan^{-1}\frac{y}{x}} & {\mathrm{(2nd~Quadrant)}}\\ & {} & {}\\ & {z = -x - j y,} & {\theta = 180^{\circ} + \tan^{-1}\frac{y}{x}} & {\mathrm{(3rd~Quadrant)}}\\ & {} & {}\\ & {z = x - j y,} & {\theta = 360^{\circ} - \tan^{-1}\frac{y}{x}} & {\mathrm{(4th~Quadrant)}} \end{array} \tag{1st Quadrant}
$$

In the exponential form,  $z = r e^{j\theta}$  so that  $d z / d\theta = j r e^{j\theta} = j z$ .

assuming that  $x$  and  $y$  are positive.

The third way of representing the complex  $z$  is the exponential form:

$$
z = r e^{j\theta} \tag{B.8}
$$

This is almost the same as the polar form, because we use the same magnitude  $r$  and the angle  $\theta$ .

The three forms of representing a complex number are summarized as follows.

$$
\begin{array}{r l r l} & {z = x + j y,} & {(x = r\cos \theta ,y = r\sin \theta)} & {\mathrm{Rectangular~form}}\\ & {z = r / \theta ,} & {\left(r = \sqrt{x^{2} + y^{2}},\theta = \tan^{-1}\frac{y}{x}\right)} & {\mathrm{Polar~form}}\\ & {z = r e^{j\theta},} & {\left(r = \sqrt{x^{2} + y^{2}},\theta = \tan^{-1}\frac{y}{x}\right)} & {\mathrm{Exponential~form}} \end{array}
$$

(B.9)

The first two forms are related by Eqs. (B.5) and (B.6). In Section B.3 we will derive Euler's formula, which proves that the third form is also equivalent to the first two.

# Example B.1

Express the following complex numbers in polar and exponential form: (a)  $z_{1} = 6 + j8$ , (b)  $z_{2} = 6 - j8$ , (c)  $z_{3} = - 6 + j8$ , (d)  $z_{4} = - 6 - j8$ .

# Solution:

Notice that we have deliberately chosen these complex numbers to fall in the four quadrants, as shown in Fig. B.2.

(a) For  $z_{1} = 6 + j8$  (1st quadrant),

$$
r_{1} = \sqrt{6^{2} + 8^{2}} = 10, \qquad \theta_{1} = \tan^{-1}\frac{8}{6} = 53.13^{\circ}
$$

Hence, the polar form is  $10 / 53.13^{\circ}$  and the exponential form is  $10e^{j53.13^{\circ}}$ . (b) For  $z_{2} = 6 - j8$  (4th quadrant),

$$
r_{2} = \sqrt{6^{2} + (-8)^{2}} = 10, \quad \theta_{2} = 360^{\circ} - \tan^{-1}\frac{8}{6} = 306.87^{\circ}
$$

so that the polar form is  $10 / 306.87^{\circ}$  and the exponential form is  $10e^{j306.87^{\circ}}$ . The angle  $\theta_{2}$  may also be taken as  $- 53.13^{\circ}$ , as shown in Fig. B.2, so that the polar form becomes  $10 / - 53.13^{\circ}$  and the exponential form becomes  $10e^{- j53.13^{\circ}}$ .

(c) For  $z_{3} = -6 + j8$  (2nd quadrant),

$$
r_{3} = \sqrt{(-6)^{2} + 8^{2}} = 10, \quad \theta_{3} = 180^{\circ} - \tan^{-1}\frac{8}{6} = 126.87^{\circ}
$$

Hence, the polar form is  $10 / 126.87^{\circ}$  and the exponential form is  $10e^{j126.87^{\circ}}$ . (d) For  $z_{4} = - 6 - j8$  (3rd quadrant),

$$
r_{4} = \sqrt{(-6)^{2} + (-8)^{2}} = 10, \quad \theta_{4} = 180^{\circ} + \tan^{-1}\frac{8}{6} = 233.13^{\circ}

Figure B.2 For Example B.1.

Convert the following complex numbers to polar and exponential forms:

(a)  $z_{1} = 3 - j4$ , 
(b)  $z_{2} = 5 + j12$ , 
(c)  $z_{3} = -3 - j9$ , 
(d)  $z_{4} = -7 + j$ .

Answer: (a)  $5 / 306.9^{\circ}$ ,  $5e^{j306.9^{\circ}}$ , (b)  $13 / 67.38^{\circ}$ ,  $13e^{j67.38^{\circ}}$ .

(c)  $9.487 / 251.6^{\circ}$ ,  $9.487e^{j251.6^{\circ}}$ , (d)  $7.071 / 171.9^{\circ}$ ,  $7.071e^{j171.9^{\circ}}$ .

Convert the following complex numbers into rectangular form:

(a)  $12 / - 60^{\circ}$ , (b)  $-50 / 285^{\circ}$ , (c)  $8e^{j10^{\circ}}$ , (d)  $20e^{-j\pi /3}$ .

# Solution:

(a) Using Eq. (B.6),

$$
12 / - 60^{\circ} = 12\cos (-60^{\circ}) + j12\sin (-60^{\circ}) = 6 - j10.39
$$

Note that  $\theta = - 60^{\circ}$  is the same as  $\theta = 360^{\circ} - 60^{\circ} = 300^{\circ}$ .

(b) We can write

$$
-50 / 285^{\circ} = -50\cos 285^{\circ} - j50\sin 285^{\circ} = -12.94 + j48.3
$$

(c) Similarly,

$$
8e^{j10^{\circ}} = 8\cos 10^{\circ} + j8\sin 10^{\circ} = 7.878 + j1.389
$$

(d) Finally,

$$
20e^{-j\pi /3} = 20\cos (-\pi /3) + j20\sin (-\pi /3) = 10 - j17.32
$$

Find the rectangular form of the following complex numbers: (a)  $- 8 / 210^{\circ}$ , (b)  $40 / 305^{\circ}$ , (c)  $10e^{- j30^{\circ}}$ , (d)  $50e^{j\pi /2}$ .

Answer: (a)  $6.928 + j4$ , (b)  $22.94 - j32.77$ , (c)  $8.66 - j5$ , (d)  $j50$ .

We have used lightface notation for complex numbers- since they are not time- or frequency- dependent- - whereas we use boldface notation for phasors.

# B.2 Mathematical Operations

Two complex numbers  $z_{1} = x_{1} + j y_{1}$  and  $z_{2} = x_{2} + j y_{2}$  are equal if and only if their real parts are equal and their imaginary parts are equal,

$$
x_{1} = x_{2},\qquad y_{1} = y_{2} \tag{B.10}
$$

The complex conjugate of the complex number  $z = x + j y$  is

$$
z^{*} = x - j y = r\underline{{\underline{{\theta}}}} = r e^{-j\theta} \tag{B.11}
$$

Thus, the complex conjugate of a complex number is found by replacing every  $j$  by  $- j$

Given two complex numbers  $z_{1} = x_{1} + j y_{1} = r_{1} / \theta_{1}$  and  $z_{2} = x_{2} + j y_{2} =$ $r_{2} / \theta_{2}$  their sum is

$$
z_{1} + z_{2} = (x_{1} + x_{2}) + j(y_{1} + y_{2}) \tag{B.12}
$$

and their difference is

$$
z_{1} - z_{2} = (x_{1} - x_{2}) + j(y_{1} - y_{2}) \tag{B.13}
$$

While it is more convenient to perform addition and subtraction of complex numbers in rectangular form, the product and quotient of the two complex numbers are best done in polar or exponential form. For their product,

$$
z_{1}z_{2} = r_{1}r_{2} / \theta_{1} + \theta_{2} \tag{B.14}
$$

Alternatively, using the rectangular form,

$$
\begin{array}{r l} & {z_{1}z_{2} = (x_{1} + j y_{1})(x_{2} + j y_{2})}\\ & {\qquad = (x_{1}x_{2} - y_{1}y_{2}) + j(x_{1}y_{2} + x_{2}y_{1})} \end{array} \tag{B.15}
$$

For their quotient,

$$
\frac{z_{1}}{z_{2}} = \frac{r_{1}}{r_{2}} / \theta_{1} - \theta_{2} \tag{B.16}
$$

Alternatively, using the rectangular form,

$$
\frac{z_{1}}{z_{2}} = \frac{x_{1} + j y_{1}}{x_{2} + j y_{2}} \tag{B.17}
$$

We rationalize the denominator by multiplying both the numerator and denominator by  $z_{2}^{*}$

$$
\frac{z_{1}}{z_{2}} = \frac{(x_{1} + j y_{1})(x_{2} - j y_{2})}{(x_{2} + j y_{2})(x_{2} - j y_{2})} = \frac{x_{1}x_{2} + y_{1}y_{2}}{x_{2}^{2} + y_{2}^{2}} +\frac{j x_{2}y_{1} - x_{1}y_{2}}{x_{2}^{2} + y_{2}^{2}} \tag{B.18}
$$

# Example B.3

If  $A = 2 + j5$ $B = 4 - j6$  , find: (a)  $A^{*}(A + B)$  , (b)  $(A + B) / (A - B)$

# Solution:

(a) If  $A = 2 + j5$  , then  $A^{*} = 2 - j5$  and

$$
A + B = (2 + 4) + j(5 - 6) = 6 - j
$$

so that

$$
A^{*}(A + B) = (2 - j5)(6 - j) = 12 - j2 - j30 - 5 = 7 - j32
$$

(b) Similarly,

$$
A - \mathbf{B} = (2 - 4) + j(5 - -6) = -2 + j11
$$

Hence,

$$
\begin{array}{l}{{{\frac{A+B}{A-B}}=\frac{6-j}{-2+j11}=\frac{(6-j)(-2-j11)}{(-2+j11)(-2-j11)}}}\\ {{~=\frac{-12-j66+j2-11}{(-2)^{2}+11^{2}}=\frac{-23-j64}{125}=-0.184-j0.512}}\end{array}
$$

Given that  $C = - 3 + j7$  and  $D = 8 + j$ , calculate:

(a)  $(C - D^{*})(C + D^{*})$ , 
(b)  $D^{2} / C^{*}$ , 
(c)  $2CD / (C + D)$ .

Answer: (a)  $- 103 - j26$ , (b)  $- 5.19 + j6.776$ , (c)  $6.045 + j11.53$ .

Evaluate:

Example B.4

(a)  $\frac{(2 + j5)(8e^{j10^{\circ}})}{2 + j4 + 2\underline{{/-40^{\circ}}}}$  
(b)  $\frac{j(3 - j4)^{*}}{(-1 + j6)(2 + j)^{2}}$

# Solution:

(a) Because there are terms in polar and exponential forms, it may be best to express all terms in polar form:

$$
2 + j5 = \sqrt{2^{2} + 5^{2}} \tan^{-1} 5 / 2 = 5.385 \underline{/68.2^{\circ}}
$$

$$
(2 + j5)(8e^{j10^{\circ}}) = (5.385 \underline{/68.2^{\circ}})(8 \underline{/10^{\circ}}) = 43.08 \underline{/78.2^{\circ}}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{r}{2 + j4 + 2\underline{{/ - 40^{\circ}}} = 2 + j4 + 2\cos (-40^{\circ}) + j2\sin (-40^{\circ})}\\ {= 3.532 + j2.714 = 4.454\underline{{/37.54^{\circ}}}} \end{array}
$$

Thus,

$$
\frac{(2 + j5)(8e^{j10^{\circ}})}{2 + j4 + 2\underline{{/-40^{\circ}}}} = \frac{43.08 \underline{{/78.2^{\circ}}}}{4.454 \underline{{/37.54^{\circ}}}} = 9.672 \underline{{/40.66^{\circ}}}
$$

(b) We can evaluate this in rectangular form, because all terms are in that form. But

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{j(3-j4)^{*}=j(3+j4)=-4+j3}}\\ {{(2+j)^{2}=4+j4-1=3+j4}}\\ {{(-1+j6)(2+j)^{2}=(-1+j6)(3+j4)=-3-j j18-24}}\\ {{=-27+j14}}\end{array}
$$

Hence,

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{\frac{j(3-j4)^{*}}{(-1+j6)(2+j)^{2}}=\frac{-4+j3}{-27+j14}=\frac{(-4+j3)(-27-j14)}{27^{2}+14^{2}}}}\\ {{=\frac{108+j56-j81+42}{925}=0.1622-j0.027}}\end{array}
$$

# Practice Problem B.4

Evaluate these complex fractions:

(a)  $\frac{6\sqrt{30^{\circ}} + j5 - 3}{-1 + j + 2e^{j45^{\circ}}}$  
(b)  $\left[\frac{(15 - j7)(3 + j2)^{*}}{(4 + j6)^{*}(3\sqrt{70^{\circ}})}\right]^{*}$

Answer: (a)  $3.387\sqrt{- 5.615^{\circ}}$ , (b)  $2.759\sqrt{- 287.6^{\circ}}$ .

# B.3 Euler's Formula

Euler's formula is an important result in complex variables. We derive it from the series expansion of  $e^{x}$ ,  $\cos \theta$ , and  $\sin \theta$ . We know that

$$
e^{x} = 1 + x + \frac{x^{2}}{2!} +\frac{x^{3}}{3!} +\frac{x^{4}}{4!} +\dots \tag{B.19}
$$

Replacing  $x$  by  $j\theta$  gives

$$
e^{j\theta} = 1 + j\theta -\frac{\theta^{2}}{2!} -j\frac{\theta^{3}}{3!} +\frac{\theta^{4}}{4!} +\dots \tag{B.20}
$$

Also,

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{\cos\theta=1-\frac{\theta^{2}}{2!}+\frac{\theta^{4}}{4!}-\frac{\theta^{6}}{6!}+\cdots}}\\ {{\sin\theta=\theta-\frac{\theta^{3}}{3!}+\frac{\theta^{5}}{5!}-\frac{\theta^{7}}{7!}+\cdots}}\end{array} \tag{B.21}
$$

so that

$$
\cos \theta +j\sin \theta = 1 + j\theta -\frac{\theta^{2}}{2!} -j\frac{\theta^{3}}{3!} +\frac{\theta^{4}}{4!} +j\frac{\theta^{5}}{5!} -\dots \tag{B.22}
$$

Comparing Eqs. (B.20) and (B.22), we conclude that

$$
e^{j\theta} = \cos \theta +j\sin \theta \tag{B.23}
$$

This is known as Euler's formula. The exponential form of representing a complex number as in Eq. (B.8) is based on Euler's formula. From Eq. (B.23), notice that

$$
\cos \theta = \operatorname {Re}(e^{j\theta}),\qquad \sin \theta = \operatorname {Im}(e^{j\theta}) \tag{B.24}
$$

and that

$$
|e^{j\theta}| = \sqrt{\cos^{2}\theta + \sin^{2}\theta} = 1
$$

Replacing  $\theta$  by  $- \theta$  in Eq. (B.23) gives

$$
e^{-j\theta} = \cos \theta -j\sin \theta \tag{B.25}
$$

Adding Eqs. (B.23) and (B.25) yields

$$
\cos \theta = \frac{1}{2} (e^{j\theta} + e^{-j\theta}) \tag{B.26}
$$

Subtracting Eq. (B.25) from Eq. (B.23) yields

$$
\sin \theta = \frac{1}{2j} (e^{j\theta} - e^{-j\theta}) \tag{B.27}
$$

# Useful Identities

The following identities are useful in dealing with complex numbers. If  $z = x + jy = r / \theta$ , then

$$
z z^{*} = x^{2} + y^{2} = r^{2} \tag{B.28}
$$

$$
\sqrt{z} = \sqrt{x + jy} = \sqrt{r} e^{j\theta /2} = \sqrt{r} \big / \theta /2 \tag{B.29}
$$

$$
z^{n} = (x + jy)^{n} = r^{n} \big / n\theta = r^{n}e^{jn\theta} = r^{n}(\cos n\theta + j \sin n\theta) \tag{B.30}
$$

$$
z^{1 / n} = (x + jy)^{1 / n} = r^{1 / n} \big / \theta /n + 2\pi k / n \tag{B.31}
$$

$$
k = 0, 1, 2, \ldots , n - 1 \tag{B.31}
$$

$$
\ln (re^{j\theta}) = \ln r + \ln e^{j\theta} = \ln r + j\theta + j2k\pi \tag{B.32}
$$

$(k =$  integer)

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{\frac{1}{j}=-j}}\\ {{e^{\pm j\pi}=-1}}\\ {{e^{\pm j2\pi}=1}}\\ {{e^{j\pi/2}=j}}\\ {{e^{j\pi/2}=-j}}\end{array} \tag{B.33}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{r l} & {\mathrm{Re}(e^{(\alpha +j\omega)t}) = \mathrm{Re} (e^{\alpha t}e^{j\omega t}) = e^{\alpha t}\cos \omega t}\\ & {\mathrm{Im}(e^{(\alpha +j\omega)t}) = \mathrm{Im}(e^{\alpha t}e^{j\omega t}) = e^{\alpha t}\sin \omega t} \end{array} \tag{B.34}
$$

If  $A = 6 + j8$ , find: (a)  $\sqrt{A}$ , (b)  $A^{4}$ .

# Solution:

(a) First, convert A to polar form:

$$
r = \sqrt{6^{2} + 8^{2}} = 10, \qquad \theta = \tan^{-1} \frac{8}{6} = 53.13^{\circ}, \qquad A = 10 / 53.13^{\circ}
$$

Then

$$
\sqrt{A} = \sqrt{10} \big / 53.13^{\circ} / 2 = 3.162 \big / 26.56^{\circ}
$$

(b) Because  $A = 10 \big / 53.13^{\circ}$ ,

$$
A^{4} = r^{4} / 4\theta = 10^{4} / 4 \times 53.13^{\circ} = 10,000 / 212.52^{\circ}
$$

If  $A = 3 - j4$ , find: (a)  $A^{1 / 3}$  (3 roots), and (b)  $\ln A$ .

Answer: (a)  $1.71 \big / 102.3^{\circ}$ ,  $1.71 \big / 222.3^{\circ}$ ,  $1.71 \big / 342.3^{\circ}$ ,

(b)  $1.609 + j5.356 + j2n\pi$ $(n = 0, 1, 2, \ldots)$ .

6.71 By combining a summer with an integrator, we get the circuit shown in Fig. D.9 where  $C = 2 \mu \mathrm{F}$ ,  $R_{1} = 500 \mathrm{k}\Omega$ ,  $R_{2} = 125 \mathrm{k}\Omega$ , and  $R_{3} = 50 \mathrm{k}\Omega$ .

For the given problem,  $C = 2 \mu \mathrm{F}: R_{1} = 500 \mathrm{k}\Omega$ ,  $R_{2} = 125 \mathrm{k}\Omega$ ,  $R_{3} = 50 \mathrm{k}\Omega$ .

Let  $\nu_{a} = \nu_{b} = \nu$ . At node  $a$ ,

$$
\frac{0 - \nu}{R} = \frac{\nu - \nu_{0}}{R} \longrightarrow 2\nu - \nu_{0} = 0 \tag{1}
$$

At node  $b$ ,  $\frac{\nu_{i} - \nu}{R} = \frac{\nu - \nu_{0}}{R} + C \frac{d\nu}{dt}$

$$
\nu_{i} = 2\nu - \nu_{o} + RC \frac{d\nu}{dt} \tag{2}
$$

Combining Eqs. (1) and (2),

$$
\nu_{i} = \nu_{o} - \nu_{o} + \frac{RC}{2} \frac{d\nu_{o}}{dt} \quad \text{or} \quad \nu_{o} = \frac{2}{RC} \int \nu_{i} dt
$$

showing that the circuit is a noninverting integrator.
