# Preface

In keeping with our focus on space for the covers for our book, we have chosen a picture from the NASA Hubble Space Telescope for the seventh edition. The reason for this is that like any satellite, many electrical circuits play critical roles in their functionality.

Conceived in the 1940s as the Large Space Telescope, the Hubble Space Telescope became the most significant development in astronomy! Why was it needed? No matter how big and accurate a terrestrial telescope could be made, it would always be severely limited because of the earth's atmosphere. Building a telescope to operate above the atmosphere would open up the things that could be seen to essentially the whole universe. Finally, we can see deeper into space than ever before. After decades of research and planning, the Hubble Space Telescope was finally launched into space on April 24, 1990.

This incredible telescope has expanded the field of astronomy and our knowledge of the universe well beyond our very limited knowledge prior to its launch. It led to determining the age of the universe, a much better understanding of our own solar system, as well as our being able to peer into the deepest recesses of the universe.

Our cover is a Hubble picture of the "Pillars of Creation! It is a picture taken deep within the galaxy and is of the Carina Nebula. Rising from the wall of the nebula, dust and towers of cool hydrogen mix to create this beautiful and dramatic image!

# Features

FeaturesA course in circuit analysis is perhaps the first exposure students have to electrical engineering. This is also a place where we can enhance some of the skills that they will later need as they learn how to design. An important part of this book is our 121 design a problem problems. These problems were developed to enhance skills that are an important part of the design process. We know it is not possible to fully develop a student's design skills in a fundamental course like circuits. To fully develop design skills a student needs a design experience normally reserved for their senior year. This does not mean that some of those skills cannot be developed and exercised in a circuits course. The text already included open- ended questions that help students use creativity, which is an important part of learning how to design. We already have some questions that are open- ended but we desired to add much more into our text in this important area and have developed an approach to do just that. When we develop problems for the student to solve our goal is that in solving the problem the student learns more about the theory and the problem solving process. Why not have the students design problems like we do? That is exactly what we do in each chapter. Within the normal problem set, we have a set of problems where we ask the student to design a problem to

help other students better understand an important concept. This has two very important results. The first will be a better understanding of the basic theory and the second will be the enhancement of some of the student's basic design skills. We are making effective use of the principle of learning by teaching. Essentially we all learn better when we teach a subject. Designing effective problems is a key part of the teaching process. Students should also be encouraged to develop problems, when appropriate, which have nice numbers and do not necessarily overemphasize complicated mathematical manipulations.

A very important advantage to our textbook, we have a total of 2,481 Examples, Practice Problems, Review Questions, and End- of- Chapter Problems! Answers are provided for all practice problems and the odd numbered end- of- chapter problems.

The main objective of the seventh edition of this book remains the same as the previous editions—to present circuit analysis in a manner that is clearer, more interesting, and easier to understand than other circuit textbooks, and to assist the student in beginning to see the “fun” in engineering. This objective is achieved in the following ways:

# Chapter Openers and Summaries

Each chapter opens with a discussion about how to enhance skills which contribute to successful problem solving as well as successful careers or a career- oriented talk on a subdiscipline of electrical engineering. This is followed by an introduction that links the chapter with the previous chapters and states the chapter objectives. The chapter ends with a summary of key points and formulas.

# Learning Objectives

Each chapter has learning objectives that reflect what we believe are the most important items to learn from that chapter. These should help you focus more carefully on what you should be learning.

# Problem-Solving Methodology

Chapter 1 introduces a six- step method for solving circuit problems which is used consistently throughout the book and media supplements to promote best- practice problem- solving procedures.

# Student-Friendly Writing Style

All principles are presented in a lucid, logical, step- by- step manner. As much as possible, we avoid wordiness and giving too much detail that could hide concepts and impede overall understanding of the material.

# Boxed Formulas and Key Terms

Important formulas are boxed as a means of helping students sort out what is essential from what is not. Also, to ensure that students clearly understand the key elements of the subject matter, key terms are defined and highlighted.

# Margin Notes

Marginal notes are used as a pedagogical aid. They serve multiple uses such as hints, cross- references, more exposition, warnings, reminders not to make some particular common mistakes, and problem- solving insights.

# Worked Examples

Worked ExamplesThoroughly worked examples are liberally given at the end of every section. The examples are regarded as a part of the text and are clearly explained without asking the reader to fill in missing steps. Thoroughly worked examples give students a good understanding of the solution process and the confidence to solve problems themselves. Some of the problems are solved in two or three different ways to facilitate a substantial comprehension of the subject material as well as a comparison of different approaches.

# Practice Problems

Practice ProblemsTo give students practice opportunity, each illustrative example is immediately followed by a practice problem with the answer. The student can follow the example step- by- step to aid in the solution of the practice problem without flipping pages or looking at the end of the book for answers. The practice problem is also intended to test a student's understanding of the preceding example. It will reinforce their grasp of the material before the student can move on to the next section. Complete solutions to the practice problems are available to students on the website.

# Application Sections

Application SectionsThe last section in each chapter is devoted to practical application aspects of the concepts covered in the chapter. The material covered in the chapter is applied to at least one or two practical problems or devices. This helps students see how the concepts are applied to real- life situations.

# Review Questions

Review QuestionsTen review questions in the form of multiple- choice objective items are provided at the end of each chapter with answers. The review questions are intended to cover the little "tricks" that the examples and end- of- chapter problems may not cover. They serve as a self test device and help students determine how well they have mastered the chapter.

# Computer Tools

Computer ToolsIn recognition of the requirements by ABET® on integrating computer tools, the use of PSpice, Multisim, MATLAB, and developing design skills are encouraged in a student- friendly manner. PSpice is covered early on in the text so that students can become familiar and use it throughout the text. Tutorials on all of these are available on Connect. MATLAB is also introduced early in the book.

# Design a Problem Problems

Design a Problem ProblemsDesign a problem problems are meant to help the student develop skills that will be needed in the design process.

# Historical Tidbits

Historical TidbitsHistorical sketches throughout the text provide profiles of important pioneers and events relevant to the study of electrical engineering.

# Early Op Amp Discussion

The operational amplifier (op amp) as a basic element is introduced early in the text.

# Fourier and Laplace Transforms Coverage

Fourier and Laplace Transforms CoverageTo ease the transition between the circuit course and signals and systems courses, Fourier and Laplace transforms are covered lucidly and thoroughly. The chapters are developed in a manner that the interested instructor can go from solutions of first- order circuits to Chapter 15. This then allows a very natural progression from Laplace to Fourier to AC.

# Extended Examples

Examples worked in detail according to the six- step problem solving method provide a road map for students to solve problems in a consistent fashion. At least one example in each chapter is developed in this manner.

# EC 2000 Chapter Openers

EC 2000 Chapter OpenersBased on ABET's skill- based CRITERION 3, these chapter openers are devoted to discussions as to how students can acquire the skills that will lead to a significantly enhanced career as an engineer. Because these skills are so very important to the student while still in college as well after graduation, we use the heading, "Enhancing your Skills and your Career."

# Homework Problems

There are 580 new or revised end- of- chapter problems and changed practice problems which will provide students with plenty of practice as well as reinforce key concepts. We continue to try to make the problems as practical as possible.

# Homework Problem Icons

Icons are used to highlight problems that relate to engineering design as well as problems that can be solved using PSpice, Multisim, or MATLAB.

# Organization

This book was written for a two- semester or three- quarter course in linear circuit analysis. The book may also be used for a one- semester course by a proper selection of chapters and sections by the instructor. It is broadly divided into three parts.

Part 1, consisting of Chapters 1 to 8, is devoted to dc circuits. It covers the fundamental laws and theorems, circuits techniques, and passive and active elements. Part 2, which contains Chapter 9 to 14, deals with ac circuits. It introduces phasors, sinusoidal steady- state analysis, ac power, rms values, three- phase systems, and frequency response. Part 3, consisting of Chapters 15 to 19, are devoted to advanced techniques for network analysis. It provides students with a solid introduction to the Laplace transform, Fourier series, Fourier transform, and two- port network analysis.

The material in the three parts is more than sufficient for a two- semester course, so the instructor must select which chapters or

sections to cover. Sections marked with the dagger sign  $(\dagger)$  may be skipped, explained briefly, or assigned as homework. They can be omitted without loss of continuity. Each chapter has plenty of problems grouped according to the sections of the related material and diverse enough that the instructor can choose some as examples and assign some as homework. As stated earlier, we are using three icons with this edition.

denotes problems that either require PSpice in the solution process, where the circuit complexity is such that PSpice or Multisim would make the solution process easier, and where PSpice or Multisim makes a good check to see if the problem has been solved correctly.

denotes problems where MATLAB is required in the solution process, where MATLAB makes sense because of the problem makeup and its complexity, and where MATLAB makes a good check to see if the problem has been solved correctly.

e2d identifies problems that help the student develop skills that are needed for engineering design.  $(\ast)$  identifies more difficult problems.

Comprehensive problems follow the end- of- chapter problems. They are mostly applications problems that require skills learned from that particular chapter.

# Prerequisites

As with most introductory circuit courses, the main prerequisites, for a course using this textbook, are physics and calculus. Although familiarity with complex numbers is helpful in the later part of the book, it is not required. A very important asset of this text is that ALL the mathematical equations and fundamentals of physics needed by the student, are included in the text.

# A Note to the Student

This may be your first course in electrical engineering. Although electrical engineering is an exciting and challenging discipline, the course may intimidate you. This book was written to prevent that. A good textbook and a good professor are an advantage—but you are the one who does the learning. If you keep the following ideas in mind, you will do very well in this course.

- This course is the foundation on which most other courses in the electrical engineering curriculum rest. For this reason, put in as much effort as you can. Study the course regularly.

- Problem solving is an essential part of the learning process. Solve as many problems as you can. Begin by solving the practice problem following each example, and then proceed to the end-of-chapter problems. The best way to learn is to solve a lot of problems. An asterisk in front of a problem indicates a challenging problem.

- Spice and Multisim, computer circuit analysis programs, are used throughout the textbook. PSpice, the personal computer version of Spice, is the popular standard circuit analysis program at most universities. PSpice for Windows and Multisim are described on our website. Make an effort to learn PSpice and/or Multisim, because you can check any circuit problem with them and be sure you are handing in a correct problem solution.

- MATLAB is another software that is very useful in circuit analysis and other courses you will be taking. A brief tutorial on MATLAB can be found on our website. The best way to learn MATLAB is to start working with it once you know a few commands.

- Each chapter ends with a section on how the material covered in the chapter can be applied to real-life situations. The concepts in this section may be new and advanced to you. No doubt, you will learn more of the details in other courses. We are mainly interested in gaining a general familiarity with these ideas.

- Attempt the review questions at the end of each chapter. They will help you discover some "tricks" not revealed in class or in the textbook.

- Clearly a lot of effort has gone into making the technical details in this book easy to understand. It also contains all the mathematics and physics necessary to understand the theory and will be very useful in your other engineering courses. However, we have also focused on creating a reference for you to use both in school as well as when working in industry or seeking a graduate degree.

- It is very tempting to sell your book after you have completed your classroom experience; however, our advice to you is DO NOT SELL YOUR ENGINEERING BOOKS! Books have always been expensive; however, the cost of this book is virtually the same as I paid for my circuits text back in the early 60s in terms of real dollars. In fact, it is actually cheaper. In addition, engineering books of the past are nowhere near as complete as what is available now.

When I was a student, I did not sell any of my engineering textbooks and was very glad I did not! I found that I needed most of them throughout my career.

A short review on finding determinants is covered in Appendix A, complex numbers in Appendix B, and mathematical formulas in Appendix C. Answers to odd- numbered problems are given in Appendix D.

# Enhancing Your Skills and Your Career

# ABET EC 2000 criteria (3.a), "an ability to apply knowledge of mathematics, science, and engineering."

As students, you are required to study mathematics, science, and engineering with the purpose of being able to apply that knowledge to the solution of engineering problems. The skill here is the ability to apply the fundamentals of these areas in the solution of a problem. So how do you develop and enhance this skill?

The best approach is to work as many problems as possible in all of your courses. However, if you are really going to be successful with this, you must spend time analyzing where and when and why you have difficulty in easily arriving at successful solutions. You may be surprised to learn that most of your problem- solving problems are with mathematics rather than your understanding of theory. You may also learn that you start working the problem too soon. Taking time to think about the problem and how you should solve it will always save you time and frustration in the end.

What I have found that works best for me is to apply our six- step problem- solving technique. Then I carefully identify the areas where I have difficulty solving the problem. Many times, my actual deficiencies are in my understanding and ability to use correctly certain mathematical principles. I then return to my fundamental math texts and carefully review the appropriate sections, and in some cases, work some example problems in that text. This brings me to another important thing you should always do: Keep nearby all your basic mathematics, science, and engineering textbooks.

This process of continually looking up material you thought you had acquired in earlier courses may seem very tedious at first; however, as your skills develop and your knowledge increases, this process will become easier and easier. On a personal note, it is this very process that led me from being a much less than average student to someone who could earn a Ph.D. and become a successful researcher.

# 1.1 Introduction

Electric circuit theory and electromagnetic theory are the two fundamental theories upon which all branches of electrical engineering are built. Many branches of electrical engineering, such as power, electric machines, control, electronics, communications, and instrumentation, are based on electric circuit theory. Therefore, the basic electric circuit theory course is the most important course for an electrical engineering student, and always an excellent starting point for a beginning student in electrical engineering education. Circuit theory is also valuable to students specializing in other branches of the physical sciences because circuits are a good model for the study of energy systems in general, and because of the applied mathematics, physics, and topology involved.

In electrical engineering, we are often interested in communicating or transferring energy from one point to another. To do this requires an interconnection of electrical devices. Such interconnection is referred to as an electric circuit, and each component of the circuit is known as an element.

An electric circuit is an interconnection of electrical elements.

Figure 1.1 A simple electric circuit.

A simple electric circuit is shown in Fig. 1.1. It consists of three basic elements: a battery, a lamp, and connecting wires. Such a simple circuit can exist by itself; it has several applications, such as a flashlight, a search light, and so forth.

A complicated real circuit is displayed in Fig. 1.2, representing the schematic diagram for a radio receiver. Although it seems complicated, this circuit can be analyzed using the techniques we cover in this book. Our goal in this text is to learn various analytical techniques and computer software applications for describing the behavior of a circuit like this.

Electric circuits are used in numerous electrical systems to accomplish different tasks. Our objective in this book is not the study of various uses and applications of circuits. Rather, our major concern is the analysis of the circuits. By the analysis of a circuit, we mean a study of the behavior

of the circuit: How does it respond to a given input? How do the interconnected elements and devices in the circuit interact?

We commence our study by defining some basic concepts. These concepts include charge, current, voltage, circuit elements, power, and energy. Before defining these concepts, we must first establish a system of units that we will use throughout the text.

# 1.2 Systems of Units

As electrical engineers, we must deal with measurable quantities. Our measurements, however, must be communicated in a standard language that virtually all professionals can understand, irrespective of the country in which the measurement is conducted. Such an international measurement language is the International System of Units (SI), adopted by the General Conference on Weights and Measures in 1960. In this system, there are seven base units from which the units of all other physical quantities can be derived. Table 1.1 shows six base units and one derived unit (the coulomb) that are related to this text. SI units are commonly used in electrical engineering.

One great advantage of the SI unit is that it uses prefixes based on the power of 10 to relate larger and smaller units to the basic unit. Table 1.2 shows the SI prefixes and their symbols. For example, the following are expressions of the same distance in meters  $(\mathrm{m})$  ..

# 1.3 Charge and Current

The concept of electric charge is the underlying principle for explaining all electrical phenomena. Also, the most basic quantity in an electric circuit is the electric charge. We all experience the effect of electric charge when we try to remove our wool sweater and have it stick to our body or walk across a carpet and receive a shock.

Charge is an electrical property of the atomic particles of which matter consists, measured in coulombs (C).

We know from elementary physics that all matter is made of fundamental building blocks known as atoms and that each atom consists of electrons, protons, and neutrons. We also know that the charge  $e$  on an electron is negative and equal in magnitude to  $1.602 \times 10^{- 19}$  C, while a proton carries a positive charge of the same magnitude as the electron. The presence of equal numbers of protons and electrons leaves an atom neutrally charged.

The following points should be noted about electric charge:

1. The coulomb is a large unit for charges. In  $1\mathrm{C}$  of charge, there are  $1 / (1.602\times 10^{-19}) = 6.24\times 10^{18}$  electrons. Thus realistic or laboratory values of charges are on the order of pC, nC, or  $\mu \mathrm{C}$  1 
2. According to experimental observations, the only charges that occur in nature are integral multiples of the electronic charge  $e = -1.602\times 10^{-19}\mathrm{C}$  
3. The law of conservation of charge states that charge can neither be created nor destroyed, only transferred. Thus, the algebraic sum of the electric charges in a system does not change.

We now consider the flow of electric charges. A unique feature of electric charge or electricity is the fact that it is mobile; that is, it can be transferred from one place to another, where it can be converted to another form of energy.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-13/c95faf42-d8e0-4f06-a665-945fc5e108f1/e42c469fadea1a4703a233f5f02d39f2a4c794fb9b06f9a8c6ae15fa0634d0bd.jpg)  
Figure 1.3 Electric current due to flow of electronic charge in a conductor.

A convention is a standard way of describing something so that others in the profession can understand what we mean. We will be using IEEE conventions throughout this book.

When a conducting wire (consisting of several atoms) is connected to a battery (a source of electromotive force), the charges are compelled to move; positive charges move in one direction while negative charges move in the opposite direction. This motion of charges creates electric current. It is conventional to take the current flow as the movement of positive charges. That is, opposite to the flow of negative charges, as Fig. 1.3 illustrates. This convention was introduced by Benjamin Franklin (1706- 1790), the American scientist and inventor. Although we now know that current in metallic conductors is due to negatively charged electrons, we will follow the universally accepted convention that current is the net flow of positive charges. Thus,

Electric current is the time rate of change of charge, measured in amperes (A).

Mathematically, the relationship between current  $i$ , charge  $q$ , and time  $t$  is

$$
i\triangleq \frac{dq}{dt} \tag{1.1}
$$

# Historical

Andre- Marie Ampere (1775- 1836), a French mathematician and physicist, laid the foundation of electrodynamics. He defined the electric current and developed a way to measure it in the 1820s.

Born in Lyons, France, Ampere at age 12 mastered Latin in a few weeks, as he was intensely interested in mathematics and many of the best mathematical works were in Latin. He was a brilliant scientist and a prolific writer. He formulated the laws of electromagnetics. He invented the electromagnet and the ammeter. The unit of electric current, the ampere, was named after him.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-13/c95faf42-d8e0-4f06-a665-945fc5e108f1/9293468cb96b5d06298f59f600d56afbe80c5045a0fb74cacf53acb603771e9f.jpg)  
Apic/Getty Images

where current is measured in amperes (A), and

$$
1\mathrm{ampere} = 1\mathrm{coulomb / second}
$$

The charge transferred between time  $t_0$  and  $t$  is obtained by integrating both sides of Eq. (1.1). We obtain

$$
Q\triangleq \int_{t_0}^{t}i dt \tag{1.2}
$$

The way we define current as  $i$  in Eq. (1.1) suggests that current need not be a constant- valued function. As many of the examples and problems in this chapter and subsequent chapters suggest, there can be several types of current; that is, charge can vary with time in several ways.

There are different ways of looking at direct current and alternating current. The best definition is that there are two ways that current can flow: It can always flow in the same direction, where it does not reverse direction, in which case we have direct current (dc). These currents can be constant or time varying. If the current flows in both directions, then we have alternating current (ac).

A direct current (dc) flows only in one direction and can be constant or time varying.

By convention, we will use the symbol  $I$  to represent a constant current. If the current varies with respect to time (either dc or ac) we will use the symbol  $i$ . A common use of this would be the output of a rectifier (dc) such as  $i(t) = |5 \sin (377t)|$  amps or a sinusoidal current (ac) such as  $i(t) = 160 \sin (377t)$  amps.

An alternating current (ac) is a current that changes direction with respect to time.

An example of alternating current (ac) is the current you use in your house to run the air conditioner, refrigerator, washing machine, and other electric appliances. Figure 1.4 depicts two common examples of dc

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-13/c95faf42-d8e0-4f06-a665-945fc5e108f1/e0f122850995aa063c2cedab56f119c795bdfb200c7f43b0fdca116ddaa61042.jpg)

Figure 1.5 Conventional current flow: (a) positive current flow, (b) negative current flow.

(coming from a battery) and ac (coming from your home outlets). We will consider other types later in the book.

Once we define current as the movement of charge, we expect current to have an associated direction of flow. As mentioned earlier, the direction of current flow is conventionally taken as the direction of positive charge movement. Based on this convention, a current of  $5\mathrm{A}$  may be represented positively or negatively as shown in Fig. 1.5. In other words, a negative current of  $- 5\mathrm{A}$  flowing in one direction as shown in Fig. 1.5(b) is the same as a current of  $+5\mathrm{A}$  flowing in the opposite direction.

Example 1.1 How much charge is represented by 4,600 electrons?

# Solution:

Each electron has  $- 1.602 \times 10^{- 19}$  C. Hence 4,600 electrons will have  $- 1.602 \times 10^{- 19}$  C/electron  $\times 4,600$  electrons  $= - 7.369 \times 10^{- 16}$  C

# Practice Problem 1.1

Calculate the amount of charge represented by 10 billion protons.

Answer:  $1.6021 \times 10^{- 9}$  C.

# Example 1.2

The total charge entering a terminal is given by  $q = 5t$  sin  $4\pi t$  mC. Calculate the current at  $t = 0.5$  s.

# Solution:

$$
i = \frac{dq}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt} (5t\sin 4\pi t)\mathrm{mC / s} = (5\sin 4\pi t + 20\pi t\cos 4\pi t)\mathrm{mA}
$$

At  $t = 0.5$

$$
i = 5\sin 2\pi +10\pi \cos 2\pi = 0 + 10\pi = 31.42\mathrm{mA}
$$

# Practice Problem 1.2

If in Example 1.2,  $q = (20 - 15t - 10e^{- 3t})$  mC, find the current at  $t = 1.0$  s.

Answer:  $- 13.506$  mA.

# Example 1.3

Determine the total charge entering a terminal between  $t = 1$  s and  $t = 2$  s if the current passing the terminal is  $i = (3t^2 - t)$  A.

# Solution:

$$
\begin{array}{l}{{Q=\int_{t=1}^{2}i d t=\int_{1}^{2}\left(3t^{2}-t\right)d t}}\\ {{\ }}\\ {{=\left(t^{3}-\frac{t^{2}}{2}\right)\Big|_{1}^{2}=\left(8-2\right)-\left(1-\frac{1}{2}\right)=5.5\mathrm{~C}}}\end{array}
$$

The current flowing through an element is

$$
i = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}8\mathrm{A}, & 0< t< 1\\ 8t^2\mathrm{A}, & t > 1 \end{array} \right.
$$

Calculate the charge entering the element from  $t = 0$  to  $t = 2 \mathrm{~s}$ .

Answer: 26.67 C.

# 1.4 Voltage

As explained briefly in the previous section, to move the electron in a conductor in a particular direction requires some work or energy transfer. This work is performed by an external electromotive force (emf), typically represented by the battery in Fig. 1.3. This emf is also known as voltage or potential difference. The voltage  $\nu_{ab}$  between two points  $a$  and  $b$  in an electric circuit is the energy (or work) needed to move a unit charge from  $b$  to  $a$ ; mathematically,

$$
\nu_{ab}\triangleq \frac{dw}{dq} \tag{1.3}
$$

where  $w$  is energy in joules (J) and  $q$  is charge in coulombs (C). The voltage  $\nu_{ab}$  or simply  $v$  is measured in volts (V), named in honor of the Italian physicist Alessandro Antonio Volta (1745- 1827), who invented the first voltaic battery. From Eq. (1.3), it is evident that

Thus,

Voltage (or potential difference) is the energy required to move a unit charge from a reference point  $(- )$  to another point  $(+)$ , measured in volts (V).

Figure 1.6 shows the voltage across an element (represented by a rectangular block) connected to points  $a$  and  $b$ . The plus  $(+)$  and minus  $(- )$  signs are used to define reference direction or voltage polarity. The  $\nu_{ab}$  can be interpreted in two ways: (1) Point  $a$  is at a potential of  $\nu_{ab}$  volts higher than point  $b$ , or (2) the potential at point  $a$  with respect to point  $b$  is  $\nu_{ab}$ . It follows logically that in general

$$
\nu_{ab} = -\nu_{ba} \tag{1.4}
$$

For example, in Fig. 1.7, we have two representations of the same voltage. In Fig. 1.7(a), point  $a$  is  $+9 \mathrm{~V}$  above point  $b$ ; in Fig. 1.7(b), point  $b$  is  $- 9 \mathrm{~V}$  above point  $a$ . We may say that in Fig. 1.7(a), there is a 9- V voltage drop from  $a$  to  $b$  or equivalently a 9- V voltage rise from  $b$  to  $a$ . In other words, a voltage drop from  $a$  to  $b$  is equivalent to a voltage rise from  $b$  to  $a$ .

Current and voltage are the two basic variables in electric circuits. The common term signal is used for an electric quantity such as a current or a voltage (or even electromagnetic wave) when it is used for

Alessandro Antonio Volta (1745- 1827), an Italian physicist, invented the electric battery- which provided the first continuous flow of electricity- and the capacitor.

Born into a noble family in Como, Italy, Volta was performing electrical experiments at age 18. His invention of the battery in 1796 revolutionized the use of electricity. The publication of his work in 1800 marked the beginning of electric circuit theory. Volta received many honors during his lifetime. The unit of voltage or potential difference, the volt, was named in his honor.

Keep in mind that electric current is always through an element and that electric voltage is always across the element or between two points.

conveying information. Engineers prefer to call such variables signals rather than mathematical functions of time because of their importance in communications and other disciplines. Like electric current, a constant voltage is called a dc voltage and is represented by  $V_{\cdot}$  whereas a sinusoidally time- varying voltage is called an ac voltage and is represented by  $\nu$  A dc voltage is commonly produced by a battery; ac voltage is produced by an electric generator.

# 1.5 Power and Energy

Although current and voltage are the two basic variables in an electric circuit, they are not sufficient by themselves. For practical purposes, we need to know how much power an electric device can handle. We all know from experience that a 100- watt bulb gives more light than a 60- watt bulb. We also know that when we pay our bills to the electric utility companies, we are paying for the electric energy consumed over a certain period of time. Thus, power and energy calculations are important in circuit analysis.

To relate power and energy to voltage and current, we recall from physics that:

Power is the time rate of expending or absorbing energy, measured in watts (W).

We write this relationship as

$$
p\triangleq \frac{dw}{dt} \tag{1.5}
$$

where  $p$  is power in watts (W),  $w$  is energy in joules (J), and  $t$  is time in seconds (s). From Eqs. (1.1), (1.3), and (1.5), it follows that

$$
p = \frac{d w}{d t} = \frac{d w}{d q}\cdot \frac{d q}{d t} = \nu i \tag{1.6}
$$

or

$$
\boxed{p = \nu i} \tag{1.7}
$$

The power  $p$  in Eq. (1.7) is a time- varying quantity and is called the instantaneous power. Thus, the power absorbed or supplied by an element is the product of the voltage across the element and the current through it. If the power has a + sign, power is being delivered to or absorbed by the element. If, on the other hand, the power has a - sign, power is being supplied by the element. But how do we know when the power has a negative or a positive sign?

Current direction and voltage polarity play a major role in determining the sign of power. It is therefore important that we pay attention to the relationship between current  $i$  and voltage  $\nu$  in Fig. 1.8(a). The voltage polarity and current direction must conform with those shown in Fig. 1.8(a) in order for the power to have a positive sign. This is known as the passive sign convention. By the passive sign convention, current enters through the positive polarity of the voltage. In this case,  $p = +\nu i$  or  $\nu i > 0$  implies that the element is absorbing power. However, if  $p = - \nu i$  or  $\nu i< 0$ , as in Fig. 1.8(b), the element is releasing or supplying power.

Passive sign convention is satisfied when the current enters through the positive terminal of an element and  $p = +\nu i$ . If the current enters through the negative terminal,  $p = - \nu i$ .

Unless otherwise stated, we will follow the passive sign convention throughout this text. For example, the element in both circuits of Fig. 1.9 has an absorbing power of  $+12$  W because a positive current enters the positive terminal in both cases. In Fig. 1.10, however, the element is supplying power of  $+12$  W because a positive current enters the negative terminal. Of course, an absorbing power of  $- 12$  W is equivalent to a supplying power of  $+12$  W. In general,

# +Power absorbed = -Power supplied

In fact, the law of conservation of energy must be obeyed in any electric circuit. For this reason, the algebraic sum of power in a circuit, at any instant of time, must be zero:

$$
\boxed{\sum p = 0} \tag{1.8}
$$

This again confirms the fact that the total power supplied to the circuit must balance the total power absorbed.

From Eq. (1.6), the energy absorbed or supplied by an element from time  $t_0$  to time  $t$  is

$$
w = \int_{t_0}^t p dt = \int_{t_0}^t \nu i dt \tag{1.9}
$$

Energy is the capacity to do work, measured in joules (J).

The electric power utility companies measure energy in watt- hours (Wh), where

$$
1\mathrm{Wh} = 3,600\mathrm{J}
$$

# Example 1.4

An energy source forces a constant current of 2 A for 10 s to flow through a light bulb. If  $2.3 \mathrm{kJ}$  is given off in the form of light and heat energy, calculate the voltage drop across the bulb.

# Solution:

The total charge is

$$
\Delta q = i \Delta t = 2 \times 10 = 20 \mathrm{C}
$$

The voltage drop is

$$
\nu = \frac{\Delta w}{\Delta q} = \frac{2.3 \times 10^{3}}{20} = 115 \mathrm{V}
$$

# Practice Problem 1.4

To move charge  $q$  from point  $b$  to point  $a$  requires  $100 \mathrm{J}$ . Find the voltage drop  $\nu_{ab}$  (the voltage at  $a$  positive with respect to  $b$ ) if: (a)  $q = 5 \mathrm{C}$ , (b)  $q = - 10 \mathrm{C}$ .

Answer: (a)  $20 \mathrm{V}$ , (b)  $- 10 \mathrm{V}$ .

# Example 1.5

Find the power delivered to an element at  $t = 3 \mathrm{ms}$  if the current entering its positive terminal is

$$
i = 5\cos 60\pi t\mathrm{A}
$$

and the voltage is: (a)  $\nu = 3i$ , (b)  $\nu = 3 \mathrm{d}i / \mathrm{d}t$ .

# Solution:

(a) The voltage is  $\nu = 3i = 15 \cos 60\pi t$ ; hence, the power is

$$
p = \nu i = 75\cos^{2}60\pi t\mathrm{W}
$$

At  $t = 3 \mathrm{ms}$ ,

$$
p = 75\cos^{2}(60\pi \times 3\times 10^{-3}) = 75\cos^{2}0.18\pi = 53.48\mathrm{~W}
$$

(b) We find the voltage and the power as

$$
\nu = 3\frac{dI}{dt} = 3(-60\pi)5\sin 60\pi t = -900\pi \sin 60\pi t\mathrm{~V~}
$$

$$
p = \nu i = -4500\pi \sin 60\pi t\cos 60\pi t\mathrm{~W~}
$$

At  $t = 3 \mathrm{ms}$ ,

$$
\begin{array}{c}p = -4500\pi \sin 0.18\pi \cos 0.18\pi \mathrm{~W~} \\ = -14137.167 \sin 32.4^{\circ} \cos 32.4^{\circ} = -6.396 \mathrm{~kW~} \end{array}
$$

# Historical

1884 Exhibition In the United States, nothing promoted the future of electricity like the 1884 International Electrical Exhibition. Just imagine a world without electricity, a world illuminated by candles and gaslights, a world where the most common transportation was by walking and riding on horseback or by horse- drawn carriage. Into this world an exhibition was created that highlighted Thomas Edison and reflected his highly developed ability to promote his inventions and products. His exhibit featured spectacular lighting displays powered by an impressive 100- kW "Jumbo" generator.

Edward Weston's dynamos and lamps were featured in the United States Electric Lighting Company's display. Weston's well known collection of scientific instruments was also shown.

Other prominent exhibitors included Frank Sprague, Elihu Thompson, and the Brush Electric Company of Cleveland. The American Institute of Electrical Engineers (AIEE) held its first technical meeting on October 7- 8 at the Franklin Institute during the exhibit. AIEE merged with the Institute of Radio Engineers (IRE) in 1964 to form the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE).

Find the power delivered to the element in Example 1.5 at  $t = 5$  ms if the current remains the same but the voltage is: (a)  $\nu = 6i\mathrm{V}$

(b)  $\nu = \left(6 + 10\int_{0}^{t}i dt\right)\mathrm{V}$ .

# Example 1.6

How much energy does a 100- W electric bulb consume in two hours?

# Solution:

# 1.6 Circuit Elements

As we discussed in Section 1.1, an element is the basic building block of a circuit. An electric circuit is simply an interconnection of the elements. Circuit analysis is the process of determining voltages across (or the currents through) the elements of the circuit.

There are two types of elements found in electric circuits: passive elements and active elements. An active element is capable of generating energy while a passive element is not. Examples of passive elements are resistors, capacitors, and inductors. Typical active elements include generators, batteries, and operational amplifiers. Our aim in this section is to gain familiarity with some important active elements.

The most important active elements are voltage or current sources that generally deliver power to the circuit connected to them. There are two kinds of sources: independent and dependent sources.

An ideal independent source is an active element that provides a specified voltage or current that is completely independent of other circuit elements.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-13/c95faf42-d8e0-4f06-a665-945fc5e108f1/43e3d9f110d208097cce352d47e3e64b67a0fbf39b880fcf1e9e1d41dc1dda34.jpg)  
Figure 1.11 Symbols for independent voltage sources: (a) used for constant or time-varying voltage, (b) used for constant voltage (dc).

In other words, an ideal independent voltage source delivers to the circuit whatever current is necessary to maintain its terminal voltage. Physical sources such as batteries and generators may be regarded as approximations to ideal voltage sources. Figure 1.11 shows the symbols for independent voltage sources. Notice that both symbols in Fig. 1.11(a) and (b) can be used to represent a dc voltage source, but only the symbol in Fig. 1.11(a) can be used for a time- varying voltage source. Similarly, an ideal independent current source is an active element that provides a specified current completely independent of the voltage across the source. That is, the current source delivers to the circuit whatever voltage

is necessary to maintain the designated current. The symbol for an independent current source is displayed in Fig. 1.12, where the arrow indicates the direction of current  $i$ .

An ideal dependent (or controlled) source is an active element in which the source quantity is controlled by another voltage or current.

Dependent sources are usually designated by diamond- shaped symbols, as shown in Fig. 1.13. Since the control of the dependent source is achieved by a voltage or current of some other element in the circuit, and the source can be voltage or current, it follows that there are four possible types of dependent sources, namely:

1. A voltage-controlled voltage source (VCVS). 
2. A current-controlled voltage source (CCVS). 
3. A voltage-controlled current source (VCCS). 
4. A current-controlled current source (CCCS).

Dependent sources are useful in modeling elements such as transistors, operational amplifiers, and integrated circuits. An example of a current- controlled voltage source is shown on the right- hand side of Fig. 1.14, where the voltage  $10i$  of the voltage source depends on the current  $i$  through element C. Students might be surprised that the value of the dependent voltage source is  $10i$  V (and not  $10i$  A) because it is a voltage source. The key idea to keep in mind is that a voltage source comes with polarities  $(+ - )$  in its symbol, while a current source comes with an arrow, irrespective of what it depends on.

It should be noted that an ideal voltage source (dependent or independent) will produce any current required to ensure that the terminal voltage is as stated, whereas an ideal current source will produce the necessary voltage to ensure the stated current flow. Thus, an ideal source could in theory supply an infinite amount of energy. It should also be noted that not only do sources supply power to a circuit, they can absorb power from a circuit too. For a voltage source, we know the voltage but not the current supplied or drawn by it. By the same token, we know the current supplied by a current source but not the voltage across it.

Figure 1.14 The source on the right-hand side is a current-controlled voltage source.

Calculate the power supplied or absorbed by each element in Fig. 1.15.

# Solution:

We apply the sign convention for power shown in Figs. 1.8 and 1.9. For  $p_1$ , the 5- A current is out of the positive terminal (or into the negative terminal); hence,

$$
p_1 = 20(-5) = -100\mathrm{W}\qquad \mathrm{Supplied~power}
$$

For  $p_2$  and  $p_3$ , the current flows into the positive terminal of the element in each case.

$$
\begin{array}{rl}p_2 = 12(5) = 60\mathrm{W} & \mathrm{Absorbed~power}\\ p_3 = 8(6) = 48\mathrm{W} & \mathrm{Absorbed~power} \end{array}
$$

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-13/c95faf42-d8e0-4f06-a665-945fc5e108f1/0fc9fa63371bc11e928177b449712c39a597fd34a06651a6b5b05056e8353e85.jpg)  
Figure 1.15 For Example 1.7.

For  $p_4$ , we should note that the voltage is  $8 \mathrm{V}$  (positive at the top), the same as the voltage for  $p_3$  since both the passive element and the dependent source are connected to the same terminals. (Remember that voltage is always measured across an element in a circuit.) Since the current flows out of the positive terminal,

$$
p_4 = 8(-0.2I) = 8(-0.2\times 5) = -8\mathrm{W}\qquad \mathrm{Supplied~power}
$$

We should observe that the 20- V independent voltage source and  $0.2I$  dependent current source are supplying power to the rest of the network, while the two passive elements are absorbing power. Also,

$$
p_1 + p_2 + p_3 + p_4 = -100 + 60 + 48 - 8 = 0
$$

In agreement with Eq. (1.8), the total power supplied equals the total power absorbed.

# 1.7 Applications

In this section, we will consider two practical applications of the concepts developed in this chapter. The first one deals with the TV picture tube and the other with how electric utilities determine your electric bill.

# 1.7.1 TV Picture Tube

One important application of the motion of electrons is found in both the transmission and reception of TV signals. At the transmission end, a TV camera reduces a scene from an optical image to an electrical signal. Scanning is accomplished with a thin beam of electrons in an iconoscope camera tube.

At the receiving end, the image is reconstructed by using a cathode- ray tube (CRT) located in the TV receiver. The CRT is depicted in Fig. 1.17. Unlike the iconoscope tube, which produces an electron beam of constant intensity, the CRT beam varies in intensity according to the incoming signal. The electron gun, maintained at a high potential, fires the electron beam. The beam passes through two sets of plates for vertical and horizontal deflections so that the spot on the screen where the beam strikes can move right and left and up and down. When the electron beam strikes the fluorescent screen, it gives off light at that spot. Thus, the beam can be made to "paint" a picture on the TV screen.

Figure 1.17 Cathode-ray tube.

# Historical

# Karl Ferdinand Braun and Vladimir K. Zworykin

Karl Ferdinand Braun (1850- 1918), of the University of Strasbourg, invented the Braun cathode- ray tube in 1879. This then became the basis for the picture tube used for so many years for televisions. It is still the most economical device today, although the price of flat- screen systems is rapidly becoming competitive. Before the Braun tube could be used in television, it took the inventiveness of Vladimir K. Zworykin (1889- 1982) to develop the iconoscope so that the modern television would become a reality. The iconoscope developed into the orthicon and the image orthicon, which allowed images to be captured and converted into signals that could be sent to the television receiver. Thus, the television camera was born.

The electron beam in a TV picture tube carries  $10^{15}$  electrons per second. As a design engineer, determine the voltage  $V_{o}$  needed to accelerate the electron beam to achieve  $4 \text{W}$ .

# Solution:

The charge on an electron is

$$
e = -1.6\times 10^{-19}\mathrm{C}
$$

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-13/c95faf42-d8e0-4f06-a665-945fc5e108f1/39e53dc957a428fd1fad69b71cdbad18985a240c7dc123228f7bc4069c09de84.jpg)  
Figure 1.18 A simplified diagram of the cathode-ray tube; for Example 1.8.

If the number of electrons is  $n$ , then  $q = ne$  and

$$
i = \frac{dq}{dt} = e\frac{dn}{dt} = (-1.6\times 10^{-19})(10^{15}) = -1.6\times 10^{-4}\mathrm{A}
$$

The negative sign indicates that the current flows in a direction opposite to electron flow as shown in Fig. 1.18, which is a simplified diagram of the CRT for the case when the vertical deflection plates carry no charge. The beam power is

$$
p = V_{o}t\qquad \mathrm{or}\qquad V_{o} = \frac{p}{i} = \frac{4}{1.6\times 10^{-4}} = 25,000\mathrm{~V}
$$

Thus, the required voltage is  $25\mathrm{kV}$ .

# Practice Problem 1.8

If an electron beam in a TV picture tube carries  $10^{13}$  electrons/second and is passing through plates maintained at a potential difference of  $25\mathrm{kV}$ , calculate the power in the beam.

Answer:  $40\mathrm{mW}$ .

# 1.7.2 Electricity Bills

The second application deals with how an electric utility company charges their customers. The cost of electricity depends upon the amount of energy consumed in kilowatt- hours (kWh). (Other factors that affect the cost include demand and power factors; we will ignore these for now.) However, even if a consumer uses no energy at all, there is a minimum service charge the customer must pay because it costs money to stay connected to the power line. As energy consumption increases, the cost per kWh drops. It is interesting to note the average monthly consumption of household appliances for a family of five, shown in Table 1.3.

# TABLE 1.3

Typical average monthly consumption of household appliances.  

<table><tr><td>Appliance</td><td>kWh consumed</td><td>Appliance</td><td>kWh consumed</td></tr><tr><td>Water heater</td><td>500</td><td>Washing machine</td><td>120</td></tr><tr><td>Freezer</td><td>100</td><td>Stove</td><td>100</td></tr><tr><td>Lighting</td><td>100</td><td>Dryer</td><td>80</td></tr><tr><td>Dishwasher</td><td>35</td><td>Microwave oven</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>Electric iron</td><td>15</td><td>Personal computer</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>TV</td><td>10</td><td>Radio</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>Toaster</td><td>4</td><td>Clock</td><td>2</td></tr></table>

A homeowner consumes  $700\mathrm{kWh}$  in January. Determine the electricity bill for the month using the following residential rate schedule:

Base monthly charge of  $\) 12.00\(. First$ 100\mathrm{kWh} $per month at 16 cents / kWh. Next$ 200\mathrm{kWh} $per month at 10 cents / kWh. Over$ 300\mathrm{kWh}$ per month at 6 cents/kWh.

# Solution:

We calculate the electricity bill as follows.

Base monthly charge  $=$  12.00 $First$ 100\mathrm{kWh}\@\ $0.16 / \mathrm{kWh} =$  16.00 $Next$ 200\mathrm{kWh}\@\ $0.10 / \mathrm{kWh} =$  20.00 $Remaining$ 400\mathrm{kWh}\@\ $0.06 / \mathrm{kWh} =$  24.00 $Total charge$ =\ $72.00$  Average cost  $=$ $\mathrm{cost}=\frac{\S 72}{100+200+400}=10.2\mathrm{cents/kWh}$

Referring to the residential rate schedule in Example 1.9, calculate the average cost per kWh if only  $260\mathrm{kWh}$  are consumed in July when the family is on vacation most of the time.

Answer: 16.923 cents/kWh.

# 1.8 Problem Solving

Although the problems to be solved during one's career will vary in complexity and magnitude, the basic principles to be followed remain the same. The process outlined here is the one developed by the authors over many years of problem solving with students, for the solution of engineering problems in industry, and for problem solving in research.

We will list the steps simply and then elaborate on them.

1. Carefully define the problem.

2. Present everything you know about the problem.

3. Establish a set of alternative solutions and determine the one that promises the greatest likelihood of success.

4. Attempt a problem solution.

5. Evaluate the solution and check for accuracy.

6. Has the problem been solved satisfactorily? If so, present the solution; if not, then return to step 3 and continue through the process again.

1. Carefully define the problem. This may be the most important part of the process, because it becomes the foundation for all the rest of the steps. In general, the presentation of engineering problems is

somewhat incomplete. You must do all you can to make sure you understand the problem as thoroughly as the presenter of the problem understands it. Time spent at this point clearly identifying the problem will save you considerable time and frustration later. As a student, you can clarify a problem statement in a textbook by asking your professor. A problem presented to you in industry may require that you consult several individuals. At this step, it is important to develop questions that need to be addressed before continuing the solution process. If you have such questions, you need to consult with the appropriate individuals or resources to obtain the answers to those questions. With those answers, you can now refine the problem, and use that refinement as the problem statement for the rest of the solution process.

2. Present everything you know about the problem. You are now ready to write down everything you know about the problem and its possible solutions. This important step will save you time and frustration later.

3. Establish a set of alternative solutions and determine the one that promises the greatest likelihood of success. Almost every problem will have a number of possible paths that can lead to a solution. It is highly desirable to identify as many of those paths as possible. At this point, you also need to determine what tools are available to you, such as PSpice and MATLAB and other software packages that can greatly reduce effort and increase accuracy. Again, we want to stress that time spent carefully defining the problem and investigating alternative approaches to its solution will pay big dividends later. Evaluating the alternatives and determining which promises the greatest likelihood of success may be difficult but will be well worth the effort. Document this process well since you will want to come back to it if the first approach does not work.

4. Attempt a problem solution. Now is the time to actually begin solving the problem. The process you follow must be well documented in order to present a detailed solution if successful, and to evaluate the process if you are not successful. This detailed evaluation may lead to corrections that can then lead to a successful solution. It can also lead to new alternatives to try. Many times, it is wise to fully set up a solution before putting numbers into equations. This will help in checking your results.

5. Evaluate the solution and check for accuracy. You now thoroughly evaluate what you have accomplished. Decide if you have an acceptable solution, one that you want to present to your team, boss, or professor.

6. Has the problem been solved satisfactorily? If so, present the solution; if not, then return to step 3 and continue through the process again. Now you need to present your solution or try another alternative. At this point, presenting your solution may bring closure to the process. Often, however, presentation of a solution leads to further refinement of the problem definition, and the process continues. Following this process will eventually lead to a satisfactory conclusion.

Now let us look at this process for a student taking an electrical and computer engineering foundations course. (The basic process also applies to almost every engineering course.) Keep in mind that although the steps have been simplified to apply to academic types of problems, the process as stated always needs to be followed. We consider a simple example.

Solve for the current flowing through the 8-  $\Omega$  resistor in Fig. 1.19.

# Solution:

1. Carefully define the problem. This is only a simple example, but we can already see that we do not know the polarity on the 3-V source. We have the following options. We can ask the professor what the polarity should be. If we cannot ask, then we need to make a decision on what to do next. If we have time to work the problem both ways, we can solve for the current when the 3-V source is plus on top and then plus on the bottom. If we do not have the time to work it both ways, assume a polarity and then carefully document your decision. Let us assume that the professor tells us that the source is plus on the bottom as shown in Fig. 1.20.

2. Present everything you know about the problem. Presenting all that we know about the problem involves labeling the circuit clearly so that we define what we seek.

Given the circuit shown in Fig. 1.20, solve for  $i_{8\Omega}$

We now check with the professor, if reasonable, to see if the problem is properly defined.

3. Establish a set of alternative solutions and determine the one that promises the greatest likelihood of success. There are essentially three techniques that can be used to solve this problem. Later in the text you will see that you can use circuit analysis (using Kirchhoff's laws and Ohm's law), nodal analysis, and mesh analysis.

To solve for  $i_{8\Omega}$  using circuit analysis will eventually lead to a solution, but it will likely take more work than either nodal or mesh analysis. To solve for  $i_{8\Omega}$  using mesh analysis will require writing two simultaneous equations to find the two loop currents indicated in Fig. 1.21. Using nodal analysis requires solving for only one unknown. This is the easiest approach.

Figure 1.21 Using nodal analysis.

Therefore, we will solve for  $i_{8\Omega}$  using nodal analysis.

4. Attempt a problem solution. We first write down all of the equations we will need in order to find  $i_{8\Omega}$

$$
i_{8\Omega} = i_{2},\qquad i_{2} = \frac{\nu_{1}}{8},\qquad i_{8\Omega} = \frac{\nu_{1}}{8}
$$

$$
\frac{\nu_{1} - 5}{2} +\frac{\nu_{1} - 0}{8} +\frac{\nu_{1} + 3}{4} = 0
$$

Now we can solve for  $\nu_{1}$ .

$$
8\left[\frac{\nu_{1} - 5}{2} +\frac{\nu_{1} - 0}{8} +\frac{\nu_{1} + 3}{4}\right] = 0
$$

leads to  $(4\nu_{1} - 20) + (\nu_{1}) + (2\nu_{1} + 6) = 0$

$$
7\nu_{1} = +14,\qquad \nu_{1} = +2\mathrm{~V},\qquad i_{8\Omega} = \frac{\nu_{1}}{8} = \frac{2}{8} = 0.25\mathrm{~A}
$$

5. Evaluate the solution and check for accuracy. We can now use Kirchhoff's voltage law (KVL) to check the results.

$$
i_{1} = \frac{\nu_{1} - 5}{2} = \frac{2 - 5}{2} = -\frac{3}{2} = -1.5\mathrm{~A~}
$$

$$
i_{2} = i_{8\Omega} = 0.25\mathrm{~A~}
$$

$$
i_{3} = \frac{\nu_{1} + 3}{4} = \frac{2 + 3}{4} = \frac{5}{4} = 1.25\mathrm{~A~}
$$

$$
i_{1} + i_{2} + i_{3} = -1.5 + 0.25 + 1.25 = 0 \tag{Checks.}
$$

Applying KVL to loop 1,

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{-5+\nu_{2\Omega}+\nu_{8\Omega}=-5+(-i_{1}\times2)+(i_{2}\times8)}}\\ {{{}}}\\ {{=-5+[-(-1.5)2]+(0.25\times8)}}\\ {{{}}}\\ {{=-5+3+2=\mathbf{0}\qquad\mathrm{(Check s.)}}}\end{array}
$$

Applying KVL to loop 2,

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{-v_{8\Omega}+\nu_{4\Omega}-3=-(i_{2}\times8)+(i_{3}\times4)-3}}\\ {{{}}}\\ {{=-(0.25\times8)+(1.25\times4)-3}}\\ {{{}}}\\ {{=-2+5-3=0\qquad\mathrm{(Check s.)}}}\end{array}
$$

So we now have a very high degree of confidence in the accuracy of our answer.

6. Has the problem been solved satisfactorily? If so, present the solution; if not, then return to step 3 and continue through the process again. This problem has been solved satisfactorily.

The current through the 8- Ω resistor is 0.25 A flowing down through the 8- Ω resistor.

# Practice Problem 1.10

Try applying this process to some of the more difficult problems at the end of the chapter.

# 1.9 Summary

1. An electric circuit consists of electrical elements connected together.

2. The International System of Units (SI) is the international measurement language, which enables engineers to communicate their results. From the seven principal units, the units of other physical quantities can be derived.

3. Current is the rate of charge flow past a given point in a given direction.

$$
i = \frac{dq}{dt}
$$

4. Voltage is the energy required to move  $1\mathrm{C}$  of charge from a reference point  $(-)$  to another point  $(+)$

$$
\nu_{ab} = \frac{dw}{dq}
$$

5. Power is the energy supplied or absorbed per unit time. It is also the product of voltage and current.

$$
p = \frac{dw}{dt} = \nu i
$$

6. According to the passive sign convention, power assumes a positive sign when the current enters the positive polarity of the voltage across an element.

7. An ideal voltage source produces a specific potential difference across its terminals regardless of what is connected to it. An ideal current source produces a specific current through its terminals regardless of what is connected to it.

8. Voltage and current sources can be dependent or independent. A dependent source is one whose value depends on some other circuit variable.

9. Two areas of application of the concepts covered in this chapter are the TV picture tube and electricity billing procedure.

# Enhancing Your Skills and Your Career

# ABET EC 2000 criteria (3.b), "an ability to design and conduct experiments, as well as to analyze and interpret data."

Engineers must be able to design and conduct experiments, as well as analyze and interpret data. Most students have spent many hours performing experiments in high school and in college. During this time, you have been asked to analyze the data and to interpret the data. Therefore, you should already be skilled in these two activities. My recommendation is that, in the process of performing experiments in the future, you spend more time in analyzing and interpreting the data in the context of the experiment. What does this mean?

If you are looking at a plot of voltage versus resistance or current versus resistance or power versus resistance, what do you actually see? Does the curve make sense? Does it agree with what the theory tells you? Does it differ from expectation, and, if so, why? Clearly, practice with analyzing and interpreting data will enhance this skill.

Since most, if not all, the experiments you are required to do as a student involve little or no practice in designing the experiment, how can you develop and enhance this skill?

Actually, developing this skill under this constraint is not as difficult as it seems. What you need to do is to take the experiment and analyze it. Just break it down into its simplest parts, reconstruct it trying to understand why each element is there, and finally, determine what the author of the experiment is trying to teach you. Even though it may not always seem so, every experiment you do was designed by someone who was sincerely motivated to teach you something.

# 2.1 Introduction

Chapter 1 introduced basic concepts such as current, voltage, and power in an electric circuit. To actually determine the values of these variables in a given circuit requires that we understand some fundamental laws that govern electric circuits. These laws, known as Ohm's law and Kirchhoff's laws, form the foundation upon which electric circuit analysis is built.

In this chapter, in addition to these laws, we shall discuss some techniques commonly applied in circuit design and analysis. These techniques include combining resistors in series or parallel, voltage division, current division, and delta- to- wye and wye- to- delta transformations. The application of these laws and techniques will be restricted to resistive circuits in this chapter. We will finally apply the laws and techniques to real- life problems of electrical lighting and the design of dc meters.

Figure 2.1 (a) Resistor, (b) Circuit symbol for resistance.

Materials in general have a characteristic behavior of resisting the flow of electric charge. This physical property, or ability to resist current, is known as resistance and is represented by the symbol  $R$ . The resistance of any material with a uniform cross- sectional area  $A$  depends on  $A$  and its length  $\ell$ , as shown in Fig. 2.1(a). We can represent resistance (as measured in the laboratory), in mathematical form,

$$
R = \rho \frac{\ell}{A} \tag{2.1}
$$

where  $\rho$  is known as the resistivity of the material in ohm- meters. Good conductors, such as copper and aluminum, have low resistivities, while insulators, such as mica and paper, have high resistivities. Table 2.1 presents the values of  $\rho$  for some common materials and shows which materials are used for conductors, insulators, and semiconductors.

The circuit element used to model the current- resisting behavior of a material is the resistor. For the purpose of constructing circuits, resistors

are usually made from metallic alloys and carbon compounds. The circuit symbol for the resistor is shown in Fig. 2.1(b), where  $R$  stands for the resistance of the resistor. The resistor is the simplest passive element.

Georg Simon Ohm (1787- 1854), a German physicist, is credited with finding the relationship between current and voltage for a resistor. This relationship is known as Ohm's law.

Ohm's law states that the voltage v across a resistor is directly proportional to the current  $i$  flowing through the resistor.

That is,

$$
\nu \propto i \tag{2.2}
$$

Ohm defined the constant of proportionality for a resistor to be the resistance,  $R$ . (The resistance is a material property which can change if the internal or external conditions of the element are altered, e.g., if there are changes in the temperature.) Thus, Eq. (2.2) becomes

$$
\nu = iR \tag{2.3}
$$

# Historical

Georg Simon Ohm (1787- 1854), a German physicist, in 1826 experimentally determined the most basic law relating voltage and current for a resistor. Ohm's work was initially denied by critics.

Born of humble beginnings in Erlangen, Bavaria, Ohm threw himself into electrical research. His efforts resulted in his famous law. He was awarded the Copley Medal in 1841 by the Royal Society of London. In 1849, he was given the Professor of Physics chair by the University of Munich. To honor him, the unit of resistance was named the ohm.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-13/c95faf42-d8e0-4f06-a665-945fc5e108f1/ef24179a7c0056899ddf9444a62e95612911fdea7ab60af4acf0197d44f0bf98.jpg)

which is the mathematical form of Ohm's law.  $R$  in Eq. (2.3) is measured in the unit of ohms, designated  $\Omega$ . Thus,

The resistance  $R$  of an element denotes its ability to resist the flow of electric current, it is measured in ohms  $(\Omega)$ .

We may deduce from Eq. (2.3) that

$$
R = \frac{\nu}{i} \tag{2.4}
$$

so that

$$
1\Omega = 1\mathrm{V / A}
$$

To apply Ohm's law as stated in Eq. (2.3), we must pay careful attention to the current direction and voltage polarity. The direction of current  $i$  and the polarity of voltage  $\nu$  must conform with the passive sign convention, as shown in Fig. 2.1(b). This implies that current flows from a higher potential to a lower potential in order for  $\nu = iR$ . If current flows from a lower potential to a higher potential,  $\nu = - iR$ .

Since the value of  $R$  can range from zero to infinity, it is important that we consider the two extreme possible values of  $R$ . An element with  $R = 0$  is called a short circuit, as shown in Fig. 2.2(a). For a short circuit,

$$
\nu = iR = 0 \tag{2.5}
$$

showing that the voltage is zero but the current could be anything. In practice, a short circuit is usually a connecting wire assumed to be a perfect conductor. Thus,

A short circuit is a circuit element with resistance approaching zero.

Similarly, an element with  $R = \infty$  is known as an open circuit, as shown in Fig. 2.2(b). For an open circuit,

$$
i = \lim_{R\to \infty}\frac{\nu}{R} = 0 \tag{2.6}
$$

An open circuit is a circuit element with resistance approaching infinity.

Figure 2.4 Circuit symbol for: (a) a variable resistor in general, (b) a potentiometer.

A resistor is either fixed or variable. Most resistors are of the fixed type, meaning their resistance remains constant. The two common types of fixed resistors (wire wound and composition) are shown in Fig. 2.3. The composition resistors are used when large resistance is needed. The circuit symbol in Fig. 2.1(b) is for a fixed resistor. Variable resistors have adjustable resistance. The symbol for a variable resistor is shown in Fig. 2.4(a). A common variable resistor is known as a potentiometer or pot for short, with the symbol shown in Fig. 2.4(b). The pot is a three- terminal element with a sliding contact or wiper. By sliding the wiper, the resistances between the wiper terminal and the fixed terminals vary. Like fixed resistors, variable resistors can be of either wire wound or composition type, as shown in Fig. 2.5. Although resistors like those in Figs. 2.3 and 2.5 are used in circuit designs, today most circuit components including resistors are either surface mounted or integrated, as typically shown in Fig. 2.6.

It should be pointed out that not all resistors obey Ohm's law. A resistor that obeys Ohm's law is known as a linear resistor. It has a constant resistance and thus its current- voltage characteristic is as illustrated in Fig. 2.7(a): Its  $i$ -  $\nu$  graph is a straight line passing through the origin. A nonlinear resistor does not obey Ohm's law. Its resistance varies with current and its  $i$ -  $\nu$  characteristic is typically shown in Fig. 2.7(b). Examples of devices with nonlinear resistance are the light bulb and the diode. Although all practical resistors may exhibit nonlinear behavior under certain conditions, we will assume in this book that all elements actually designated as resistors are linear.

A useful quantity in circuit analysis is the reciprocal of resistance  $R$ , known as conductance and denoted by  $G$ :

$$
\begin{array}{r}{G = \frac{1}{R} = \frac{i}{\nu}} \end{array} \tag{2.7}
$$

The conductance is a measure of how well an element will conduct electric current. The unit of conductance is the mho (ohm spelled backward) or reciprocal ohm, with symbol  $\mathfrak{O}$ , the inverted omega. Although engineers often use the mho, in this book we prefer to use the siemens (S), the SI unit of conductance:

$$
1\mathrm{S} = 1\mathfrak{O} = 1\mathrm{A} / \mathrm{V} \tag{2.8}
$$

Thus,

Conductance is the ability of an element to conduct electric current; it is measured in mhos ( $\mathfrak{O}$ ) or siemens (S).

The same resistance can be expressed in ohms or siemens. For example,  $10 \Omega$  is the same as  $0.1 \mathrm{~S}$ . From Eq. (2.7), we may write

$$
i = G\nu \tag{2.9}
$$

The power dissipated by a resistor can be expressed in terms of  $R$ . Using Eqs. (1.7) and (2.3),

$$
p = \nu i = i^2 R = \frac{\nu^2}{R} \tag{2.10}
$$

The power dissipated by a resistor may also be expressed in terms of  $G$  as

$$
p = \nu i = \nu^{2}G = \frac{i^{2}}{G} \tag{2.11}
$$

We should note two things from Eqs. (2.10) and (2.11):

1. The power dissipated in a resistor is a nonlinear function of either current or voltage.

2. Since  $R$  and  $G$  are positive quantities, the power dissipated in a resistor is always positive. Thus, a resistor always absorbs power from the circuit. This confirms the idea that a resistor is a passive element, incapable of generating energy.

# Solution:

From Ohm's law,

$$
R = \frac{\nu}{i} = \frac{120}{2} = 60 \Omega
$$

Figure 2.8 For Example 2.2.

In the circuit shown in Fig. 2.8, calculate the current  $i$ , the conductance  $G$ , and the power  $p$ .

# Solution:

The voltage across the resistor is the same as the source voltage  $(30 \mathrm{V})$  because the resistor and the voltage source are connected to the same pair of terminals. Hence, the current is

$$
i = \frac{\nu}{R} = \frac{30}{5 \times 10^{3}} = 6 \mathrm{mA}
$$

The conductance is

$$
G = \frac{1}{R} = \frac{1}{5 \times 10^{3}} = 0.2 \mathrm{mS}
$$

We can calculate the power in various ways using either Eqs. (1.7), (2.10), or (2.11).

$$
p = \nu i = 30(6 \times 10^{-3}) = 180 \mathrm{mW}
$$

or

$$
p = i^{2} R = \left(6 \times 10^{-3}\right)^{2} \times 10^{3} = 180 \mathrm{mW}
$$

or

$$
p = \nu^{2} G = (30)^{2} 0.2 \times 10^{-3} = 180 \mathrm{mW}

# 2.3 Nodes, Branches, and Loops

Since the elements of an electric circuit can be interconnected in several ways, we need to understand some basic concepts of network topology. To differentiate between a circuit and a network, we may regard a network as an interconnection of elements or devices, whereas a circuit is a network providing one or more closed paths. The convention, when addressing network topology, is to use the word network rather than circuit. We do this even though the word network and circuit mean the same thing when used in this context. In network topology, we study the properties relating to the placement of elements in the network and the geometric configuration of the network. Such elements include branches, nodes, and loops.

A branch represents a single element such as a voltage source or a resistor.

In other words, a branch represents any two- terminal element. The circuit in Fig. 2.10 has five branches, namely, the 10- V voltage source, the 2- A current source, and the three resistors.

A node is the point of connection between two or more branches.

A node is usually indicated by a dot in a circuit. If a short circuit (a connecting wire) connects two nodes, the two nodes constitute a single node. The circuit in Fig. 2.10 has three nodes  $a$ ,  $b$ , and  $c$ . Notice that the

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-13/c95faf42-d8e0-4f06-a665-945fc5e108f1/346be7f644283f58cf83729531eb34055b8fc028b34f24395bee83dafde3c462.jpg)

Figure 2.11 The three-node circuit of Fig. 2.10 is redrawn.

three points that form node  $b$  are connected by perfectly conducting wires and therefore constitute a single point. The same is true of the four points forming node  $c$ . We demonstrate that the circuit in Fig. 2.10 has only three nodes by redrawing the circuit in Fig. 2.11. The two circuits in Figs. 2.10 and 2.11 are identical. However, for the sake of clarity, nodes  $b$  and  $c$  are spread out with perfect conductors as in Fig. 2.10.

A loop is any closed path in a circuit.

A loop is a closed path formed by starting at a node, passing through a set of nodes, and returning to the starting node without passing through any node more than once. A loop is said to be independent if it contains at least one branch which is not a part of any other independent loop. Independent loops or paths result in independent sets of equations.

It is possible to form an independent set of loops where one of the loops does not contain such a branch. In Fig. 2.11, abca with the  $2\Omega$  resistor is independent. A second loop with the  $3\Omega$  resistor and the current source is independent. The third loop could be the one with the  $2\Omega$  resistor in parallel with the  $3\Omega$  resistor. This does form an independent set of loops.

A network with  $b$  branches,  $n$  nodes, and  $l$  independent loops will satisfy the fundamental theorem of network topology:

$$
b = l + n - 1 \tag{2.12}
$$

As the next two definitions show, circuit topology is of great value to the study of voltages and currents in an electric circuit.

Two or more elements are in series if they exclusively share a single node and consequently carry the same current.

Two or more elements are in parallel if they are connected to the same two nodes and consequently have the same voltage across them.

Elements are in series when they are chain- connected or connected sequentially, end to end. For example, two elements are in series if they share one common node and no other element is connected to that common node. Elements in parallel are connected to the same pair of terminals. Elements may be connected in a way that they are neither in series nor in parallel. In the circuit shown in Fig. 2.10, the voltage source and the  $5 - \Omega$  resistor are in series because the same current will flow through them. The  $2 - \Omega$  resistor, the  $3 - \Omega$  resistor, and the current source are in parallel because they are connected to the same two nodes  $b$  and  $c$  and consequently have the same voltage across them. The  $5 - \Omega$  and  $2 - \Omega$  resistors are neither in series nor in parallel with each other.

# Example 2.4

Determine the number of branches and nodes in the circuit shown in Fig. 2.12. Identify which elements are in series and which are in parallel.

# Solution:

Since there are four elements in the circuit, the circuit has four branches:  $10\mathrm{V},5\Omega ,6\Omega$  and 2 A. The circuit has three nodes as identified in Fig. 2.13. The  $5 - \Omega$  resistor is in series with the 10- V voltage source because the same current would flow in both. The  $6 - \Omega$  resistor is in parallel with the 2- A current source because both are connected to the same nodes 2 and 3.

# 2.4 Kirchhoff's Laws

Ohm's law by itself is not sufficient to analyze circuits. However, when it is coupled with Kirchhoff's two laws, we have a sufficient, powerful set of tools for analyzing a large variety of electric circuits. Kirchhoff's laws were first introduced in 1847 by the German physicist Gustav Robert Kirchhoff (1824- 1887). These laws are formally known as Kirchhoff's current law (KCL) and Kirchhoff's voltage law (KVL).

Kirchhoff's first law is based on the law of conservation of charge, which requires that the algebraic sum of charges within a system cannot change.

Kirchhoff's current law (KCL) states that the algebraic sum of currents entering a node (or a closed boundary) is zero.

Mathematically, KCL implies that

$$
\sum_{n = 1}^{N}i_{n} = 0 \tag{2.13}
$$

where  $N$  is the number of branches connected to the node and  $i_{n}$  is the  $n$ th current entering (or leaving) the node. By this law, currents entering a node may be regarded as positive, while currents leaving the node may be taken as negative or vice versa.

Gustav Robert Kirchhoff (1824- 1887), a German physicist, stated two basic laws in 1847 concerning the relationship between the currents and voltages in an electrical network. Kirchhoff's laws, along with Ohm's law, form the basis of circuit theory.

Born the son of a lawyer in Konigsberg, East Prussia, Kirchhoff entered the University of Konigsberg at age 18 and later became a lecturer in Berlin. His collaborative work in spectroscopy with German chemist Robert Bunsen led to the discovery of cesium in 1860 and rubidium in 1861. Kirchhoff was also credited with the Kirchhoff law of radiation. Thus, Kirchhoff is famous among engineers, chemists, and physicists.

To prove KCL, assume a set of currents  $i_{k}(t), k = 1,2,\ldots$ , flow into a node. The algebraic sum of currents at the node is

$$
i_{T}(t) = i_{1}(t) + i_{2}(t) + i_{3}(t) + \dots \tag{2.14}
$$

Integrating both sides of Eq. (2.14) gives

$$
q_{T}(t) = q_{1}(t) + q_{2}(t) + q_{3}(t) + \dots \tag{2.15}
$$

Figure 2.16 Currents at a node illustrating KCL.

where  $\begin{array}{r}{q_{k}(t) = \int i_{k}(t)d t} \end{array}$  and  $\begin{array}{r}{q_{T}(t) = \int i_{T}(t)d t} \end{array}$  . But the law of conservation of electric charge requires that the algebraic sum of electric charges at the node must not change; that is, the node stores no net charge. Thus,  $q_{T}(t) = 0\rightarrow i_{T}(t) = 0$  , confirming the validity of KCL.

Consider the node in Fig. 2.16. Applying KCL gives

$$
i_{1} + (-i_{2}) + i_{3} + i_{4} + (-i_{5}) = 0 \tag{2.16}
$$

since currents  $i_{1}, i_{3}$ , and  $i_{4}$  are entering the node, while currents  $i_{2}$  and  $i_{5}$  are leaving it. By rearranging the terms, we get

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-13/c95faf42-d8e0-4f06-a665-945fc5e108f1/7edb1e83ea6ca303666039c9277c0bc1b894138ec4ace32061b5b4730ba3e43f.jpg)  
Figure 2.17 Applying KCL to a closed boundary.

$$
i_{1} + i_{3} + i_{4} = i_{2} + i_{5} \tag{2.17}
$$

Equation (2.17) is an alternative form of KCL:

The sum of the currents entering a node is equal to the sum of the currents leaving the node.

Two sources (or circuits in general) are said to be equivalent if they have the same  $i$ -  $v$  relationship at a pair of terminals.

Note that KCL also applies to a closed boundary. This may be regarded as a generalized case, because a node may be regarded as a closed surface shrunk to a point. In two dimensions, a closed boundary is the same as a closed path. As typically illustrated in the circuit of Fig. 2.17, the total current entering the closed surface is equal to the total current leaving the surface.

A simple application of KCL is combining current sources in parallel. The combined current is the algebraic sum of the current supplied by the individual sources. For example, the current sources shown in

Fig. 2.18(a) can be combined as in Fig. 2.18(b). The combined or equivalent current source can be found by applying KCL to node  $a$ .

$$
I_{T} + I_{2} = I_{1} + I_{3}
$$

or

$$
I_{T} = I_{1} - I_{2} + I_{3} \tag{2.18}
$$

A circuit cannot contain two different currents,  $I_{1}$  and  $I_{2}$ , in series, unless  $I_{1} = I_{2}$ ; otherwise KCL will be violated.

Kirchhoff's second law is based on the principle of conservation of energy:

Kirchhoff's voltage law (KVL) states that the algebraic sum of all voltages around a closed path (or loop) is zero.

Expressed mathematically, KVL states that

$$
\sum_{m = 1}^{M}\nu_{m} = 0 \tag{2.19}
$$

where  $M$  is the number of voltages in the loop (or the number of branches in the loop) and  $\nu_{m}$  is the  $m$ th voltage.

To illustrate KVL, consider the circuit in Fig. 2.19. The sign on each voltage is the polarity of the terminal encountered first as we travel around the loop. We can start with any branch and go around the loop either clockwise or counterclockwise. Suppose we start with the voltage source and go clockwise around the loop as shown; then voltages would be  $- \nu_{1}, + \nu_{2}, + \nu_{3}, + \nu_{4}$ , and  $- \nu_{5}$ , in that order. For example, as we reach branch 3, the positive terminal is met first; hence, we have  $+\nu_{3}$ . For branch 4, we reach the negative terminal first; hence,  $- \nu_{4}$ . Thus, KVL yields

$$
-\nu_{1} + \nu_{2} + \nu_{3} - \nu_{4} + \nu_{5} = 0 \tag{2.20}
$$

Rearranging terms gives

$$
\nu_{2} + \nu_{3} + \nu_{5} = \nu_{1} + \nu_{4} \tag{2.21}
$$

which may be interpreted as

$$
\mathrm{Sum~of~voltage~drops~ = ~Sum~of~voltage~risas} \tag{2.22}
$$

This is an alternative form of KVL. Notice that if we had traveled counterclockwise, the result would have been  $+\nu_{1}, - \nu_{5}, + \nu_{4}, - \nu_{3}$ , and  $- \nu_{2}$ , which is the same as before except that the signs are reversed. Hence, Eqs. (2.20) and (2.21) remain the same.

When voltage sources are connected in series, KVL can be applied to obtain the total voltage. The combined voltage is the algebraic sum of the voltages of the individual sources. For example, for the voltage sources shown in Fig. 2.20(a), the combined or equivalent voltage source in Fig. 2.20(b) is obtained by applying KVL.

$$
-V_{ab} + V_{1} + V_{2} - V_{3} = 0
$$

# Solution:

To find  $\nu_{1}$  and  $\nu_{2}$  we apply Ohm's law and Kirchhoff's voltage law. Assume that current  $i$  flows through the loop as shown in Fig. 2.21(b). From Ohm's law,

$$
\nu_{1} = 2i, \qquad \nu_{2} = -3i \tag{2.5.1}
$$

Applying KVL around the loop gives

$$
-20 + \nu_{1} - \nu_{2} = 0 \tag{2.5.2}
$$

Substituting Eq. (2.5.1) into Eq. (2.5.2), we obtain

$$
-20 + 2i + 3i = 0 \qquad \text{or} \qquad 5i = 20 \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad i = 4 \mathrm{~A}
$$

Substituting  $i$  in Eq. (2.5.1) finally gives

$$
\nu_{1} = 8 \mathrm{~V}, \qquad \nu_{2} = -12 \mathrm{~V}
$$

Figure 2.27 For Example 2.8.

# Solution:

We apply Ohm's law and Kirchhoff's laws. By Ohm's law,

$$
\nu_{1} = 8i_{1}, \qquad \nu_{2} = 3i_{2}, \qquad \nu_{3} = 6i_{3} \tag{2.8.1}
$$

Since the voltage and current of each resistor are related by Ohm's law as shown, we are really looking for three things:  $(\nu_{1}, \nu_{2}, \nu_{3})$  or  $(i_{1}, i_{2}, i_{3})$ . At node  $a$ , KCL gives

$$
i_{1} - i_{2} - i_{3} = 0 \tag{2.8.2}
$$

Applying KVL to loop 1 as in Fig. 2.27(b),

$$
-30 + \nu_{1} + \nu_{2} = 0
$$

We express this in terms of  $i_{1}$  and  $i_{2}$  as in Eq. (2.8.1) to obtain

$$
-30 + 8i_{1} + 3i_{2} = 0
$$

or

$$
i_{1} = \frac{(30 - 3i_{2})}{8} \tag{2.8.3}
$$

Applying KVL to loop 2,

$$
-\nu_{2} + \nu_{3} = 0 \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad \nu_{3} = \nu_{2} \tag{2.8.4}
$$

as expected since the two resistors are in parallel. We express  $\nu_{1}$  and  $\nu_{2}$  in terms of  $i_{1}$  and  $i_{2}$  as in Eq. (2.8.1). Equation (2.8.4) becomes

$$
6i_{3} = 3i_{2} \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad i_{3} = \frac{i_{2}}{2} \tag{2.8.5}
$$

Substituting Eqs. (2.8.3) and (2.8.5) into (2.8.2) gives

$$
\frac{30 - 3i_{2}}{8} -i_{2} - \frac{i_{2}}{2} = 0
$$

or  $i_{2} = 2$  A. From the value of  $i_{2}$ , we now use Eqs. (2.8.1) to (2.8.5) to obtain

$$
i_{1} = 3\mathrm{A},\qquad i_{3} = 1\mathrm{A},\qquad \nu_{1} = 24\mathrm{V},\qquad \nu_{2} = 6\mathrm{V},\qquad \nu_{3} = 6\mathrm{V}
$$

Find the currents and voltages in the circuit shown in Fig. 2.28.

Answer:  $\nu_{1} = 6\mathrm{V}$ ,  $\nu_{2} = 4\mathrm{V}$ ,  $\nu_{3} = 10\mathrm{V}$ ,  $i_{1} = 3\mathrm{A}$ ,  $i_{2} = 500\mathrm{mA}$ ,  $i_{3} = 2.5\mathrm{A}$ .

# 2.5 Series Resistors and Voltage Division

The need to combine resistors in series or in parallel occurs so frequently that it warrants special attention. The process of combining the resistors is facilitated by combining two of them at a time. With this in mind, consider the single- loop circuit of Fig. 2.29. The two resistors are in series, since the same current  $i$  flows in both of them. Applying Ohm's law to each of the resistors, we obtain

$$
\nu_{1} = iR_{1}, \qquad \nu_{2} = iR_{2} \tag{2.24}
$$

If we apply KVL to the loop (moving in the clockwise direction), we have

$$
-\nu +\nu_{1} + \nu_{2} = 0 \tag{2.25}
$$

Combining Eqs. (2.24) and (2.25), we get

$$
\nu = \nu_{1} + \nu_{2} = i(R_{1} + R_{2}) \tag{2.26}
$$

or

$$
i = \frac{\nu}{R_{1} + R_{2}} \tag{2.27}
$$

Equivalent circuit of the Fig. 2.29 circuit.

implying that the two resistors can be replaced by an equivalent resistor  $R_{\mathrm{eq}}$ ; that is,

$$
R_{\mathrm{eq}} = R_{1} + R_{2} \tag{2.29}
$$

Thus, Fig. 2.29 can be replaced by the equivalent circuit in Fig. 2.30. The two circuits in Figs. 2.29 and 2.30 are equivalent because they exhibit the same voltage- current relationships at the terminals  $a - b$ . An equivalent circuit such as the one in Fig. 2.30 is useful in simplifying the analysis of a circuit. In general,

The equivalent resistance of any number of resistors connected in series is the sum of the individual resistances.

Resistors in series behave as a single resistor whose resistance is equal to the sum of the resistances of the individual resistors.

For  $N$  resistors in series then,

$$
R_{\mathrm{eq}} = R_{1} + R_{2} + \dots +R_{N} = \sum_{n = 1}^{N}R_{n} \tag{2.30}
$$

To determine the voltage across each resistor in Fig. 2.29, we substitute Eq. (2.26) into Eq. (2.24) and obtain

$$
\nu_{1} = \frac{R_{1}}{R_{1} + R_{2}} \nu , \qquad \nu_{2} = \frac{R_{2}}{R_{1} + R_{2}} \nu \tag{2.31}
$$

Notice that the source voltage  $\nu$  is divided among the resistors in direct proportion to their resistances; the larger the resistance, the larger the voltage drop. This is called the principle of voltage division, and the circuit in Fig. 2.29 is called a voltage divider. In general, if a voltage divider has  $N$  resistors  $(R_{1}, R_{2}, \ldots , R_{N})$  in series with the source voltage  $\nu$ , the  $n$ th resistor  $(R_{n})$  will have a voltage drop of

$$
\nu_{n} = \frac{R_{n}}{R_{1} + R_{2} + \cdots + R_{N}} \nu \tag{2.32}
$$

# 2.6 Parallel Resistors and Current Division

Figure 2.31 Two resistors in parallel.

Consider the circuit in Fig. 2.31, where two resistors are connected in parallel and therefore have the same voltage across them. From Ohm's law,

$$
\nu = i_{1}R_{1} = i_{2}R_{2}
$$

or

$$
i_{1} = \frac{\nu}{R_{1}}, \qquad i_{2} = \frac{\nu}{R_{2}} \tag{2.33}
$$

Applying KCL at node  $a$  gives the total current  $i$  as

$$
i = i_{1} + i_{2} \tag{2.34}
$$

Substituting Eq. (2.33) into Eq. (2.34), we get

$$
i = \frac{\nu}{R_{1}} +\frac{\nu}{R_{2}} = \nu \left(\frac{1}{R_{1}} +\frac{1}{R_{2}}\right) = \frac{\nu}{R_{\mathrm{eq}}} \tag{2.35}
$$

where  $R_{\mathrm{eq}}$  is the equivalent resistance of the resistors in parallel:

$$
\frac{1}{R_{\mathrm{eq}}} = \frac{1}{R_{1}} +\frac{1}{R_{2}} \tag{2.36}
$$

or

$$
\frac{1}{R_{\mathrm{eq}}} = \frac{R_{1} + R_{2}}{R_{1}R_{2}}
$$

or

$$
R_{\mathrm{eq}} = \frac{R_{1}R_{2}}{R_{1} + R_{2}} \tag{2.37}
$$

Thus,

The equivalent resistance of two parallel resistors is equal to the product of their resistances divided by their sum.

It must be emphasized that this applies only to two resistors in parallel. From Eq. (2.37), if  $R_{1} = R_{2}$  then  $R_{\mathrm{eq}} = R_{1} / R_{2}$

We can extend the result in Eq. (2.36) to the general case of a circuit with  $N$  resistors in parallel. The equivalent resistance is

$$
\frac{1}{R_{\mathrm{eq}}} = \frac{1}{R_{1}} +\frac{1}{R_{2}} +\dots +\frac{1}{R_{N}} \tag{2.38}
$$

Note that  $R_{\mathrm{eq}}$  is always smaller than the resistance of the smallest resistor in the parallel combination. If  $R_{1} = R_{2} = \dots = R_{N} = R$ , then

$$
R_{\mathrm{eq}} = \frac{R}{N} \tag{2.39}
$$

For example, if four  $100 - \Omega$  resistors are connected in parallel, their equivalent resistance is  $25\Omega$

It is often more convenient to use conductance rather than resistance when dealing with resistors in parallel. From Eq. (2.38), the equivalent conductance for  $N$  resistors in parallel is

$$
G_{\mathrm{eq}} = G_{1} + G_{2} + G_{3} + \dots +G_{N} \tag{2.40}
$$

where  $G_{\mathrm{eq}} = 1 / R_{\mathrm{eq}}$ ,  $G_{1} = 1 / R_{1}$ ,  $G_{2} = 1 / R_{2}$ ,  $G_{3} = 1 / R_{3}$ ,  $\dots$ ,  $G_{N} = 1 / R_{N}$ . Equation (2.40) states:

The equivalent conductance of resistors connected in parallel is the sum of their individual conductances.

This means that we may replace the circuit in Fig. 2.31 with that in Fig. 2.32. Notice the similarity between Eqs. (2.30) and (2.40). The equivalent conductance of parallel resistors is obtained the same way as the equivalent resistance of series resistors. In the same manner, the equivalent conductance of resistors in series is obtained just the same

Conductances in parallel behave as a single conductance whose value is equal to the sum of the individual conductances.

\frac{1}{G_{\mathrm{eq}}} = \frac{1}{G_{1}} +\frac{1}{G_{2}} +\frac{1}{G_{3}} +\dots +\frac{1}{G_{N}} \tag{2.41}
$$

Figure 2.33 (a) A shorted circuit, (b) an open circuit.

Given the total current  $i$  entering node  $a$  in Fig. 2.31, how do we obtain current  $i_{1}$  and  $i_{2}$ ? We know that the equivalent resistor has the same voltage, or

$$
\nu = i R_{\mathrm{eq}} = \frac{i R_{1} R_{2}}{R_{1} + R_{2}} \tag{2.42}
$$

Combining Eqs. (2.33) and (2.42) results in

$$
\boxed{ \begin{array}{r l} & {i_{1} = \frac{R_{2} i}{R_{1} + R_{2}},\qquad i_{2} = \frac{R_{1} i}{R_{1} + R_{2}}} \end{array} } \tag{2.43}
$$

which shows that the total current  $i$  is shared by the resistors in inverse proportion to their resistances. This is known as the principle of current division, and the circuit in Fig. 2.31 is known as a current divider. Notice that the larger current flows through the smaller resistance.

As an extreme case, suppose one of the resistors in Fig. 2.31 is zero, say  $R_{2} = 0$ , that is,  $R_{2}$  is a short circuit, as shown in Fig. 2.33(a). From Eq. (2.43),  $R_{2} = 0$  implies that  $i_{1} = 0$ ,  $i_{2} = i$ . This means that the entire current  $i$  bypasses  $R_{1}$  and flows through the short circuit  $R_{2} = 0$ , the path of least resistance. Thus when a circuit is short circuited, as shown in Fig. 2.33(a), two things should be kept in mind:

1. The equivalent resistance  $R_{\mathrm{eq}} = 0$ . [See what happens when  $R_{2} = 0$  in Eq. (2.37).]

2. The entire current flows through the short circuit.

As another extreme case, suppose  $R_{2} = \infty$ , that is,  $R_{2}$  is an open circuit, as shown in Fig. 2.33(b). The current still flows through the path of least resistance,  $R_{1}$ . By taking the limit of Eq. (2.37) as  $R_{2} \to \infty$ , we obtain  $R_{\mathrm{eq}} = R_{1}$  in this case.

If we divide both the numerator and denominator by  $R_{1} R_{2}$ , Eq. (2.43) becomes

$$
i_{1} = \frac{G_{1}}{G_{1} + G_{2}} i \tag{2.44a}
$$

$$
i_{2} = \frac{G_{2}}{G_{1} + G_{2}} i \tag{2.44b}
$$

Thus, in general, if a current divider has  $N$  conductors  $(G_{1}, G_{2}, \ldots , G_{N})$  in parallel with the source current  $i$ , the  $n$ th conductor  $(G_{n})$  will have current

$$
i_{n} = \frac{G_{n}}{G_{1} + G_{2} + \cdots + G_{N}} i \tag{2.45}
$$

In general, it is often convenient and possible to combine resistors in series and parallel and reduce a resistive network to a single equivalent resistance  $R_{\mathrm{eq}}$ . Such an equivalent resistance is the resistance between the designated terminals of the network and must exhibit the same  $i - \nu$  characteristics as the original network at the terminals.

Find  $R_{\mathrm{eq}}$  for the circuit shown in Fig. 2.34.

# Solution:

To get  $R_{\mathrm{eq}}$ , we combine resistors in series and in parallel. The  $6 - \Omega$  and  $3 - \Omega$  resistors are in parallel, so their equivalent resistance is

$$
6\Omega \| 3\Omega = \frac{6\times 3}{6 + 3} = 2\Omega
$$

(The symbol  $\parallel$  is used to indicate a parallel combination.) Also, the  $1 - \Omega$  and  $5 - \Omega$  resistors are in series; hence their equivalent resistance is

$$
1\Omega +5\Omega = 6\Omega
$$

Thus the circuit in Fig. 2.34 is reduced to that in Fig. 2.35(a). In Fig. 2.35(a), we notice that the two  $2 - \Omega$  resistors are in series, so the equivalent resistance is

$$
2\Omega +2\Omega = 4\Omega
$$

This  $4 - \Omega$  resistor is now in parallel with the  $6 - \Omega$  resistor in Fig. 2.35(a); their equivalent resistance is

$$
4\Omega \| 6\Omega = \frac{4\times 6}{4 + 6} = 2.4\Omega
$$

The circuit in Fig. 2.35(a) is now replaced with that in Fig. 2.35(b). In Fig. 2.35(b), the three resistors are in series. Hence, the equivalent resistance for the circuit is

Calculate the equivalent resistance  $R_{ab}$  in the circuit in Fig. 2.37.  
Figure 2.37 For Example 2.10.

# Solution:

The  $3 - \Omega$  and  $6 - \Omega$  resistors are in parallel because they are connected to the same two nodes  $c$  and  $b$ . Their combined resistance is

$$
3\Omega \| 6\Omega = \frac{3\times 6}{3 + 6} = 2\Omega \tag{2.10.1}
$$

Similarly, the  $12 - \Omega$  and  $4 - \Omega$  resistors are in parallel since they are connected to the same two nodes  $d$  and  $b$ . Hence

$$
12\Omega \| 4\Omega = \frac{12\times 4}{12 + 4} = 3\Omega \tag{2.10.2}
$$

Also the  $1 - \Omega$  and  $5 - \Omega$  resistors are in series; hence, their equivalent resistance is

$$
1\Omega +5\Omega = 6\Omega \tag{2.10.3}
$$

With these three combinations, we can replace the circuit in Fig. 2.37 with that in Fig. 2.38(a). In Fig. 2.38(a),  $3 - \Omega$  in parallel with  $6 - \Omega$  gives  $2 - \Omega$ , as calculated in Eq. (2.10.1). This  $2 - \Omega$  equivalent resistance is now in series with the  $1 - \Omega$  resistance to give a combined resistance of  $1\Omega +2\Omega = 3\Omega$ . Thus, we replace the circuit in Fig. 2.38(a) with that in Fig. 2.38(b). In Fig. 2.38(b), we combine the  $2 - \Omega$  and  $3 - \Omega$  resistors in parallel to get

$$
2\Omega \| 3\Omega = \frac{2\times 3}{2 + 3} = 1.2\Omega
$$

This  $1.2 - \Omega$  resistor is in series with the  $10 - \Omega$  resistor, so that

$$
R_{ab} = 10 + 1.2 = 11.2\Omega
$$

Find  $R_{ab}$  for the circuit in Fig. 2.39.

Answer:  $19\Omega$

Find the equivalent conductance  $G_{\mathrm{eq}}$  for the circuit in Fig. 2.40(a).

# Solution:

The 8- S and 12- S resistors are in parallel, so their conductance is

$$
8\mathrm{S} + 12\mathrm{S} = 20\mathrm{S}
$$

This 20- S resistor is now in series with  $5\mathrm{S}$  as shown in Fig. 2.40(b) so that the combined conductance is

$$
\frac{20\times 5}{20 + 5} = 4\mathrm{S}
$$

This is in parallel with the 6- S resistor. Hence,

$$
G_{\mathrm{eq}} = 6 + 4 = 10\mathrm{S}
$$

We should note that the circuit in Fig. 2.40(a) is the same as that in Fig. 2.40(c). While the resistors in Fig. 2.40(a) are expressed in siemens, those in Fig. 2.40(c) are expressed in ohms. To show that the circuits are the same, we find  $R_{\mathrm{eq}}$  for the circuit in Fig. 2.40(c).

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{R_{\mathrm{eq}}=\frac{1}{6}\bigg\|(\frac{1}{5}+\frac{1}{8}|\frac{1}{12})=\frac{1}{6}\bigg\|(\frac{1}{5}+\frac{1}{20})=\frac{1}{6}\bigg\|\frac{1}{4}}}\\ {{=\frac{\frac{1}{6}\times\frac{1}{4}}{\frac{1}{6}+\frac{1}{4}}=\frac{1}{10}\Omega}}\\ {{G_{\mathrm{eq}}=\frac{1}{R_{\mathrm{eq}}}=\frac{1}{10}\mathrm{S}}}\end{array}
$$

This is the same as we obtained previously.

Figure 2.41 For Practice Prob. 2.11.

Find  $i_{o}$  and  $\nu_{o}$  in the circuit shown in Fig. 2.42(a). Calculate the power dissipated in the  $3 - \Omega$  resistor.

# Solution:

The  $6 - \Omega$  and  $3 - \Omega$  resistors are in parallel, so their combined resistance is

$$
6\Omega \parallel 3\Omega = \frac{6\times 3}{6 + 3} = 2\Omega
$$

Thus, our circuit reduces to that shown in Fig. 2.42(b). Notice that  $\nu_{o}$  is not affected by the combination of the resistors because the resistors are

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-13/c95faf42-d8e0-4f06-a665-945fc5e108f1/4183e7062fb2610102070a0ccf68225aa07766fc812b67e923f960527be76186.jpg)  
Figure 2.42 For Example 2.12: (a) original circuit, (b) its equivalent circuit.

in parallel and therefore have the same voltage  $\nu_{o}$ . From Fig. 2.42(b), we can obtain  $\nu_{o}$  in two ways. One way is to apply Ohm's law to get

$$
i = \frac{12}{4 + 2} = 2\mathrm{~A~}
$$

and hence,  $\nu_{o} = 2i = 2\times 2 = 4\mathrm{~V~}$ . Another way is to apply voltage division, since the  $12\mathrm{~V~}$  in Fig. 2.42(b) is divided between the  $4 - \Omega$  and  $2 - \Omega$  resistors. Hence,

$$
\nu_{o} = \frac{2}{2 + 4} (12\mathrm{~V}) = 4\mathrm{~V~}
$$

Similarly,  $i_{o}$  can be obtained in two ways. One approach is to apply Ohm's law to the  $3 - \Omega$  resistor in Fig. 2.42(a) now that we know  $\nu_{o}$ ; thus,

$$
\nu_{o} = 3i_{o} = 4\qquad \Rightarrow \qquad i_{o} = \frac{4}{3}\mathrm{~A~}
$$

Another approach is to apply current division to the circuit in Fig. 2.42(a) now that we know  $i$ , by writing

$$
i_{o} = \frac{6}{6 + 3} i = \frac{2}{3} (2\mathrm{~A}) = \frac{4}{3}\mathrm{~A~}
$$

The power dissipated in the  $3 - \Omega$  resistor is

$$
p_{o} = \nu_{o}i_{o} = 4\left(\frac{4}{3}\right) = 5.333\mathrm{~W~}
$$

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-13/c95faf42-d8e0-4f06-a665-945fc5e108f1/6d2ac9727be56f6541d660375f70219d09f438c6058238e9f3136068806a1c86.jpg)

Find  $\nu_{1}$  and  $\nu_{2}$  in the circuit shown in Fig. 2.43. Also calculate  $i_{1}$  and  $i_{2}$  and the power dissipated in the  $12 - \Omega$  and  $40 - \Omega$  resistors.

Answer:  $\nu_{1} = 10\mathrm{~V}, i_{1} = 833.3\mathrm{~mA}, p_{1} = 8.333\mathrm{~W}, \nu_{2} = 20\mathrm{~V}, i_{2} = 500\mathrm{~mA}, p_{2} = 10\mathrm{~W}$ .

# Example 2.13

For the circuit shown in Fig. 2.44(a), determine: (a) the voltage  $\nu_{o}$ , (b) the power supplied by the current source, (c) the power absorbed by each resistor.

# Solution:

(a) The  $6 - \mathrm{k}\Omega$  and  $12 - \mathrm{k}\Omega$  resistors are in series so that their combined value is  $6 + 12 = 18\mathrm{~k}\Omega$ . Thus the circuit in Fig. 2.44(a) reduces to that shown in Fig. 2.44(b). We now apply the current division technique to find  $i_{1}$  and  $i_{2}$ .

$$
\begin{array}{l}i_{1} = \frac{18,000}{9,000 + 18,000} (30\mathrm{~mA}) = 20\mathrm{~mA} \\ i_{2} = \frac{9,000}{9,000 + 18,000} (30\mathrm{~mA}) = 10\mathrm{~mA} \end{array}
$$

Notice that the voltage across the  $9 - \mathrm{k}\Omega$  and  $18 - \mathrm{k}\Omega$  resistors is the same, and  $\nu_{o} = 9,000i_{1} = 18,000i_{2} = 180 \mathrm{V}$ , as expected.

(b) Power supplied by the source is

$$
p_{o} = \nu_{o}i_{o} = 180(30) \mathrm{mW} = 5.4 \mathrm{W}
$$

(c) Power absorbed by the  $12 - \mathrm{k}\Omega$  resistor is

$$
p = i\nu = i_{2}(i_{2}R) = i_{2}^{2}R = (10\times 10^{-3})^{2}(12,000) = 1.2 \mathrm{W}
$$

Power absorbed by the  $6 - \mathrm{k}\Omega$  resistor is

$$
p = i_{2}^{2}R = (10\times 10^{-3})^{2}(6,000) = 0.6 \mathrm{W}
$$

Power absorbed by the  $9 - \mathrm{k}\Omega$  resistor is

$$
p = \frac{\nu_{o}^{2}}{R} = \frac{(180)^{2}}{9,000} = 3.6 \mathrm{W}
$$

or

$$
p = \nu_{o}i_{1} = 180(20) \mathrm{mW} = 3.6 \mathrm{W}
$$

Notice that the power supplied  $(5.4 \mathrm{W})$  equals the power absorbed  $(1.2 + 0.6 + 3.6 = 5.4 \mathrm{W})$ . This is one way of checking results.

# 2.7 Wye-Delta Transformations

Situations often arise in circuit analysis when the resistors are neither in parallel nor in series. For example, consider the bridge circuit in Fig. 2.46. How do we combine resistors  $R_{1}$  through  $R_{6}$  when the resistors are neither in series nor in parallel? Many circuits of the type shown in Fig. 2.46 can be simplified by using three- terminal equivalent networks. These are the wye (Y) or tee (T) network shown in Fig. 2.47 and the delta  $(\Delta)$  or pi (II) network shown in Fig. 2.48. These networks occur by themselves or as part of a larger network. They are used in three- phase networks, electrical filters, and matching networks. Our main interest here is in how to

identify them when they occur as part of a network and how to apply wye- delta transformation in the analysis of that network.

# Delta to Wye Conversion

Suppose it is more convenient to work with a wye network in a place where the circuit contains a delta configuration. We superimpose a wye network on the existing delta network and find the equivalent resistances in the wye network. To obtain the equivalent resistances in the wye network, we compare the two networks and make sure that the resistance between each pair of nodes in the  $\Delta$  (or  $\Pi$ ) network is the same as the resistance between the same pair of nodes in the Y (or T) network. For terminals 1 and 2 in Figs. 2.47 and 2.48, for example,

$$
R_{12}(\mathrm{Y}) = R_{1} + R_{3} \tag{2.46}
$$

$$
R_{12}(\Delta) = R_{b}\| (R_{a} + R_{c})
$$

Setting  $R_{12}(\mathrm{Y}) = R_{12}(\Delta)$  gives

$$
R_{12} = R_{1} + R_{3} = \frac{R_{b}(R_{a} + R_{c})}{R_{a} + R_{b} + R_{c}} \tag{2.47a}
$$

Similarly,

$$
R_{13} = R_{1} + R_{2} = \frac{R_{c}(R_{a} + R_{b})}{R_{a} + R_{b} + R_{c}} \tag{2.47b}
$$

$$
R_{34} = R_{2} + R_{3} = \frac{R_{a}(R_{b} + R_{c})}{R_{a} + R_{b} + R_{c}} \tag{2.47c}
$$

Subtracting Eq. (2.47c) from Eq. (2.47a), we get

$$
R_{1} - R_{2} = \frac{R_{c}(R_{b} - R_{a})}{R_{a} + R_{b} + R_{c}} \tag{2.48}
$$

Adding Eqs. (2.47b) and (2.48) gives

$$
R_{1} = \frac{R_{b}R_{c}}{R_{a} + R_{b} + R_{c}} \tag{2.49}
$$

and subtracting Eq. (2.48) from Eq. (2.47b) yields

$$
R_{2} = \frac{R_{c}R_{a}}{R_{a} + R_{b} + R_{c}} \tag{2.50}
$$

Subtracting Eq. (2.49) from Eq. (2.47a), we obtain

$$
R_{3} = \frac{R_{a}R_{b}}{R_{a} + R_{b} + R_{c}} \tag{2.51}
$$

We do not need to memorize Eqs. (2.49) to (2.51). To transform a  $\Delta$  network to Y, we create an extra node  $n$  as shown in Fig. 2.49 and follow this conversion rule:

Each resistor in the Y network is the product of the resistors in the two adjacent  $\Delta$  branches, divided by the sum of the three  $\Delta$  resistors.

One can follow this rule and obtain Eqs. (2.49) to (2.51) from Fig. 2.49.

# Wye to Delta Conversion

To obtain the conversion formulas for transforming a wye network to an equivalent delta network, we note from Eqs. (2.49) to (2.51) that

\begin{array}{c}{{R_{1}R_{2}+R_{2}R_{3}+R_{3}R_{1}=\frac{R_{a}R_{b}R_{c}(R_{a}+R_{b}+R_{c})}{(R_{a}+R_{b}+R_{c})^{2}}}}\\ {{=\frac{R_{a}R_{b}R_{c}}{R_{a}+R_{b}+R_{c}}}}\end{array} \tag{2.52}
$$

Dividing Eq. (2.52) by each of Eqs. (2.49) to (2.51) leads to the following equations:

$$
R_{a} = \frac{R_{1}R_{2} + R_{2}R_{3} + R_{3}R_{1}}{R_{1}} \tag{2.53}
$$

$$
R_{b} = \frac{R_{1}R_{2} + R_{2}R_{3} + R_{3}R_{1}}{R_{2}} \tag{2.54}
$$

$$
R_{c} = \frac{R_{1}R_{2} + R_{2}R_{3} + R_{3}R_{1}}{R_{3}} \tag{2.55}
$$

From Eqs. (2.53) to (2.55) and Fig. 2.49, the conversion rule for  $\mathrm{Y}$  to  $\Delta$  is as follows:

Each resistor in the  $\Delta$  network is the sum of all possible products of  $\mathrm{Y}$  resistors taken two at a time, divided by the opposite  $\mathrm{Y}$  resistor.

The  $\mathrm{Y}$  and  $\Delta$  networks are said to be balanced when

$$
R_{1} = R_{2} = R_{3} = R_{\mathrm{Y}},\qquad R_{a} = R_{b} = R_{c} = R_{\Delta} \tag{2.56}
$$

Under these conditions, conversion formulas become

$$
R_{\mathrm{Y}} = \frac{R_{\Delta}}{3}\qquad \mathrm{or}\qquad R_{\Delta} = 3R_{\mathrm{Y}} \tag{2.57}
$$

One may wonder why  $R_{\mathrm{Y}}$  is less than  $R_{\Delta}$ . Well, we notice that the  $\mathrm{Y}$ - connection is like a "series" connection while the  $\Delta$ - connection is like a "parallel" connection.

Note that in making the transformation, we do not take anything out of the circuit or put in anything new. We are merely substituting different but mathematically equivalent three- terminal network patterns to create a circuit in which resistors are either in series or in parallel, allowing us to calculate  $R_{\mathrm{eq}}$  if necessary.

# Solution:

Using Eqs. (2.49) to (2.51), we obtain

$$
R_{1} = \frac{R_{b}R_{c}}{R_{a} + R_{b} + R_{c}} = \frac{10\times 25}{15 + 10 + 25} = \frac{250}{50} = 5\Omega
$$

$$
R_{2} = \frac{R_{c}R_{a}}{R_{a} + R_{b} + R_{c}} = \frac{25\times 15}{50} = 7.5\Omega
$$

$$
R_{3} = \frac{R_{a}R_{b}}{R_{a} + R_{b} + R_{c}} = \frac{15\times 10}{50} = 3\Omega
$$

The equivalent Y network is shown in Fig. 2.50(b).

Figure 2.51For Practice Prob. 2.14.

# Example 2.15

Obtain the equivalent resistance  $R_{ab}$  for the circuit in Fig. 2.52 and use it to find current  $i$ .

# Solution:

1. Define. The problem is clearly defined. Please note, this part normally will deservedly take much more time.

2. Present. Clearly, when we remove the voltage source, we end up with a purely resistive circuit. Since it is composed of deltas and wyes, we have a more complex process of combining the elements together.

We can use wye- delta transformations as one approach to find a solution. It is useful to locate the wyes (there are two of them, one at  $n$  and the other at  $c$ ) and the deltas (there are three: can, abn, cnb).

3. Alternative. There are different approaches that can be used to solve this problem. Since the focus of Sec. 2.7 is the wye-delta transformation, this should be the technique to use. Another approach would be to solve for the equivalent resistance by injecting one amp into the circuit and finding the voltage between  $a$  and  $b$ ; we will learn about this approach in Chap. 4.

The approach we can apply here as a check would be to use a wye- delta transformation as the first solution to the problem. Later we can check the solution by starting with a delta- wye transformation.

4. Attempt. In this circuit, there are two Y networks and three  $\Delta$  networks. Transforming just one of these will simplify the circuit. If we convert the Y network comprising the  $5 - \Omega$ ,  $10 - \Omega$ , and  $20 - \Omega$  resistors, we may select

Figure 2.52 For Example 2.15.

$$
R_{1} = 10\Omega ,\qquad R_{2} = 20\Omega ,\qquad R_{3} = 5\Omega
$$

Thus from Eqs. (2.53) to (2.55) we have

$$
\begin{array}{l}{{R_{a}=\frac{R_{1}R_{2}+R_{2}R_{3}+R_{3}R_{1}}{R_{1}}=\frac{10\times 20+20\times 5+5\times 10}{10}}}\\ {{=\frac{350}{10}=35\Omega}}\end{array}
$$

$$
R_{b} = \frac{R_{1}R_{2} + R_{2}R_{3} + R_{3}R_{1}}{R_{2}} = \frac{350}{20} = 17.5\Omega
$$

$$
R_{c} = \frac{R_{1}R_{2} + R_{2}R_{3} + R_{3}R_{1}}{R_{3}} = \frac{350}{5} = 70\Omega
$$

With the Y converted to  $\Delta$ , the equivalent circuit (with the voltage source removed for now) is shown in Fig. 2.53(a). Combining the three pairs of resistors in parallel, we obtain

$$
70\| 30 = \frac{70\times 30}{70 + 30} = 21\Omega
$$

$$
12.5\| 17.5 = \frac{12.5\times 17.5}{12.5 + 17.5} = 7.292\Omega
$$

$$
15\| 35 = \frac{15\times 35}{15 + 35} = 10.5\Omega
$$

Figure 2.53 Equivalent circuits to Fig. 2.52, with the voltage source removed.

so that the equivalent circuit is shown in Fig. 2.53(b). Hence, we find

$$
R_{ab} = (7.292 + 10.5)\parallel 21 = \frac{17.792\times 21}{17.792 + 21} = 9.632\Omega
$$

Then

$$
i = \frac{\nu_{s}}{R_{ab}} = \frac{120}{9.632} = \mathbf{12.458A}
$$

We observe that we have successfully solved the problem. Now we must evaluate the solution.

5. Evaluate. Now we must determine if the answer is correct and then evaluate the final solution.

It is relatively easy to check the answer; we do this by solving the problem starting with a delta- wye transformation. Let us transform the delta, can, into a wye.

Let  $R_{c} = 10\Omega$ ,  $R_{a} = 5\Omega$ , and  $R_{n} = 12.5\Omega$ . This will lead to (let  $d$  represent the middle of the wye):

$$
R_{ad} = \frac{R_{c}R_{n}}{R_{a} + R_{c} + R_{n}} = \frac{10\times 12.5}{5 + 10 + 12.5} = 4.545\Omega
$$

$$
R_{cd} = \frac{R_{c}R_{n}}{27.5} = \frac{5\times 12.5}{27.5} = 2.273\Omega
$$

$$
R_{nd} = \frac{R_{c}R_{n}}{27.5} = \frac{5\times 10}{27.5} = 1.8182\Omega
$$

This now leads to the circuit shown in Figure 2.53(c). Looking at the resistance between  $d$  and  $b$ , we have two series combination in parallel, giving us

$$
R_{db} = \frac{(2.273 + 15)(1.8182 + 20)}{2.273 + 15 + 1.8182 + 20} = \frac{376.9}{39.09} = 9.642\Omega
$$

This is in series with the  $4.545$ -  $\Omega$  resistor, both of which are in parallel with the  $30$ -  $\Omega$  resistor. This then gives us the equivalent resistance of the circuit.

$$
R_{ab} = \frac{(9.642 + 4.545)30}{9.642 + 4.545 + 30} = \frac{425.6}{44.19} = \mathbf{9.631}\Omega
$$

This now leads to

$$
i = \frac{\nu_{s}}{R_{ab}} = \frac{120}{9.631} = \mathbf{12.46A}
$$

We note that using two variations on the wye- delta transformation leads to the same results. This represents a very good check.

6. Satisfactory? Since we have found the desired answer by determining the equivalent resistance of the circuit first and the answer checks, then we clearly have a satisfactory solution. This represents what can be presented to the individual assigning the problem.

For the bridge network in Fig. 2.54, find  $R_{ab}$  and  $i$ .

Answer:  $40\Omega$ ,  $6\mathrm{A}$ .

# 2.8 Applications

2.8 ApplicationsResistors are often used to model devices that convert electrical energy into heat or other forms of energy. Such devices include conducting wire, light bulbs, electric heaters, stoves, ovens, and loudspeakers. In this section, we will consider two real- life problems that apply the concepts developed in this chapter: electrical lighting systems and design of dc meters.

# 2.8.1 Lighting Systems

2.8.1 Lighting SystemsLighting systems, such as in a house or on a Christmas tree, often consist of  $N$  lamps connected either in parallel or in series, as shown in Fig. 2.55. Each lamp is modeled as a resistor. Assuming that all the lamps are identical and  $V_{o}$  is the power- line voltage, the voltage across each lamp is  $V_{o}$  for the parallel connection and  $V_{o} / N$  for the series connection. The series connection is easy to manufacture but is seldom used in practice, for at least two reasons. First, it is less reliable; when a lamp fails, all the lamps go out. Second, it is harder to maintain; when a lamp is bad, one must test all the lamps one by one to detect the faulty one.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-13/c95faf42-d8e0-4f06-a665-945fc5e108f1/05cc1e49855dc2e8c07e10c789566992673d059c6416017a29a0ce80aa841d54.jpg)  
Figure 2.54 For Practice Prob. 2.15.

So far, we have assumed that connecting wires are perfect conductors (i.e., conductors of zero resistance). In real physical systems, however, the resistance of the connecting wire may be appreciably large, and the modeling of the system must include that resistance.

# Historical

Thomas Alva Edison (1847- 1931) was perhaps the greatest American inventor. He patented 1093 inventions, including such history- making inventions as the incandescent electric bulb, the phonograph, and the first commercial motion pictures.

Born in Milan, Ohio, the youngest of seven children, Edison received only three months of formal education because he hated school. He was home- schooled by his mother and quickly began to read on his own. In 1868, Edison read one of Faraday's books and found his calling. He moved to Menlo Park, New Jersey, in 1876, where he managed a well- staffed research laboratory. Most of his inventions came out of this laboratory. His laboratory served as a model for modern research organizations. Because of his diverse interests and the overwhelming number of his inventions and patents, Edison began to establish manufacturing companies for making the devices he invented. He designed the first electric power station to supply electric light. Formal electrical engineering education began in the mid- 1880s with Edison as a role model and leader.

# Example 2.16

Three light bulbs are connected to a 9- V battery as shown in Fig. 2.56(a). Calculate: (a) the total current supplied by the battery, (b) the current through each bulb, (c) the resistance of each bulb.

Figure 2.56(a) Lighting system with three bulbs, (b) resistive circuit equivalent model.

# Solution:

(a) The total power supplied by the battery is equal to the total power absorbed by the bulbs; that is,

$$
p = 15 + 10 + 20 = 45\mathrm{W}
$$

Since  $p = V, I$ , then the total current supplied by the battery is

$$
I = \frac{p}{V} = \frac{45}{9} = 5\mathrm{~A~}
$$

(b) The bulbs can be modeled as resistors as shown in Fig. 2.56(b). Since  $R_{1}$  (20-W bulb) is in parallel with the battery as well as the series combination of  $R_{2}$  and  $R_{3}$ ,

$$
V_{1} = V_{2} + V_{3} = 9\mathrm{~V~}
$$

The current through  $R_{1}$  is

$$
I_{1} = \frac{p_{1}}{V_{1}} = \frac{20}{9} = 2.222\mathrm{~A~}
$$

By KCL, the current through the series combination of  $R_{2}$  and  $R_{3}$  is

$$
I_{2} = I - I_{1} = 5 - 2.222 = 2.778\mathrm{~A}
$$

(c) Since  $p = I^2 R$ ,

$$
\begin{array}{l}{R_1 = \frac{p_1}{I_1^2} = \frac{20}{2.222^2} = 4.05\Omega}\\ {R_2 = \frac{p_2}{I_2^2} = \frac{15}{2.777^2} = 1.945\Omega}\\ {R_3 = \frac{p_3}{I_3^2} = \frac{10}{2.777^2} = 1.297\Omega} \end{array}
$$

Refer to Fig. 2.55 and assume there are ten light bulbs that can be connected in parallel and ten different light bulbs that can be connected in series. In either case, each light bulb is to operate at  $40 \mathrm{W}$ . If the voltage at the plug is  $110 \mathrm{V}$  for the parallel and series connections, calculate the current through each bulb for both cases.Answer: 364 mA (parallel), 3.64 A (series).

Answer:  $364~\mathrm{mA}$  parallel),3.64Aseries.

# 2.8.2 Design of DC Meters

By their nature, resistors are used to control the flow of current. We take advantage of this property in several applications, such as in a potentiometer (Fig. 2.57). The word potentiometer, derived from the words potential and meter, implies that potential can be metered out. The potentiometer (or pot for short) is a three- terminal device that operates on the principle of voltage division. It is essentially an adjustable voltage divider. As a voltage regulator, it is used as a volume or level control on radios, TVs, and other devices. In Fig. 2.57,

$$
V_{\mathrm{out}} = V_{bc} = \frac{R_{bc}}{R_{ac}} V_{\mathrm{in}} \tag{2.58}
$$

where  $R_{ac} = R_{ab} + R_{bc}$  . Thus,  $V_{\mathrm{out}}$  decreases or increases as the sliding contact of the pot moves toward  $c$  or  $a$  , respectively.

Another application where resistors are used to control current flow is in the analog dc meters- the ammeter, voltmeter, and ohmmeter, which measure current, voltage, and resistance, respectively. Each of these meters employs the d'Arsonval meter movement, shown in Fig. 2.58. The movement consists essentially of a movable iron- core coil mounted on a pivot between the poles of a permanent magnet. When current flows through the coil, it creates a torque which causes the pointer to deflect. The amount of current through the coil determines the deflection of the pointer, which is registered on a scale attached to the meter movement. For example, if the meter movement is rated  $1\mathrm{mA}$ $50\Omega$  it would take  $1\mathrm{mA}$  to cause a full- scale deflection of the meter movement. By introducing additional circuitry to the d'Arsonval meter movement, an ammeter, voltmeter, or ohmmeter can be constructed.

Consider Fig. 2.59, where an analog voltmeter and ammeter are connected to an element. The voltmeter measures the voltage across a load and

# Practice Problem 2.16

An instrument capable of measuring voltage, current, and resistance is called a multimeter or a volt- ohm meter (VOM).

A load is a component that is receiving energy (an energy sink), as opposed to a generator supplying energy (an energy source). More about loading will be discussed in Section 4.9.1.

Figure 2.59 Connection of a voltmeter and an ammeter to an element.

is therefore connected in parallel with the element. As shown in Fig. 2.60(a), the voltmeter consists of a d'Arsonval movement in series with a resistor whose resistance  $R_{m}$  is deliberately made very large (theoretically, infinite), to minimize the current drawn from the circuit. To extend the range of voltage that the meter can measure, series multiplier resistors are often connected with the voltmeters, as shown in Fig. 2.60(b). The multiple- range voltmeter in Fig. 2.60(b) can measure voltage from 0 to  $1\mathrm{V}$ , 0 to  $10\mathrm{V}$ , or 0 to  $100\mathrm{V}$ , depending on whether the switch is connected to  $R_{1}$ ,  $R_{2}$ , or  $R_{3}$ , respectively.

Let us calculate the multiplier resistor  $R_{n}$  for the single- range voltmeter in Fig. 2.60(a), or  $R_{n} = R_{1}$ ,  $R_{2}$ , or  $R_{3}$  for the multiple- range voltmeter in Fig. 2.60(b). We need to determine the value of  $R_{n}$  to be connected in series with the internal resistance  $R_{m}$  of the voltmeter. In any design, we consider the worst- case condition. In this case, the worst case occurs when the full- scale current  $I_{\mathrm{fs}} = I_{m}$  flows through the meter. This should also correspond

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-13/c95faf42-d8e0-4f06-a665-945fc5e108f1/9970f4852861aead22228573ceae70986b715d160f75e2c6b4825da87c681615.jpg)  
Figure 2.60 Voltmeters: (a) single-range type, (b) multiple-range type.

to the maximum voltage reading or the full- scale voltage  $V_{\mathrm{fs}}$ . Since the multiplier resistance  $R_{n}$  is in series with the internal resistance  $R_{m}$ ,

$$
V_{\mathrm{fs}} = I_{\mathrm{fs}}(R_n + R_m) \tag{2.59}
$$

From this, we obtain

$$
R_{n} = \frac{V_{\mathrm{fs}}}{I_{\mathrm{fs}}} -R_{m} \tag{2.60}
$$

Similarly, the ammeter measures the current through the load and is connected in series with it. As shown in Fig. 2.61(a), the ammeter consists of a d'Arsonval movement in parallel with a resistor whose resistance  $R_{m}$  is deliberately made very small (theoretically, zero) to minimize the voltage drop across it. To allow multiple ranges, shunt resistors are often connected in parallel with  $R_{m}$  as shown in Fig. 2.61(b). The shunt resistors allow the meter to measure in the range  $0 - 10\mathrm{mA}$ ,  $0 - 100\mathrm{mA}$ , or  $0 - 1\mathrm{A}$ , depending on whether the switch is connected to  $R_{1}$ ,  $R_{2}$ , or  $R_{3}$ , respectively.

Now our objective is to obtain the multiplier shunt  $R_{n}$  for the single- range ammeter in Fig. 2.61(a), or  $R_{n} = R_{1}$ ,  $R_{2}$ , or  $R_{3}$  for the multiple- range ammeter in Fig. 2.61(b). We notice that  $R_{m}$  and  $R_{n}$  are in parallel and that at full- scale reading  $I = I_{\mathrm{fs}} = I_{m} + I_{n}$ , where  $I_{n}$  is the current through the shunt resistor  $R_{n}$ . Applying the current division principle yields

$$
I_{m} = \frac{R_{n}}{R_{n} + R_{m}} I_{\mathrm{fs}}
$$

or

$$
R_{n} = \frac{I_{m}}{I_{\mathrm{fs}} - I_{m}} R_{m} \tag{2.61}
$$

The resistance  $R_{x}$  of a linear resistor can be measured in two ways. An indirect way is to measure the current  $I$  that flows through it by connecting an ammeter in series with it and the voltage  $V$  across it by connecting a voltmeter in parallel with it, as shown in Fig. 2.62(a). Then

$$
R_{x} = \frac{V}{I} \tag{2.62}
$$

The direct method of measuring resistance is to use an ohmmeter. An ohmmeter consists basically of a d'Arsonval movement, a variable resistor or potentiometer, and a battery, as shown in Fig. 2.62(b). Applying KVL to the circuit in Fig. 2.62(b) gives

$$
E = (R + R_{m} + R_{x})I_{m}
$$

or

$$
R_{x} = \frac{E}{I_{m}} -(R + R_{m}) \tag{2.63}
$$

The resistor  $R$  is selected such that the meter gives a full- scale deflection; that is,  $I_{m} = I_{\mathrm{fs}}$  when  $R_{x} = 0$ . This implies that

$$
E = (R + R_{m})I_{\mathrm{fs}} \tag{2.64}
$$

Substituting Eq. (2.64) into Eq. (2.63) leads to

$$
R_{x} = \left(\frac{I_{\mathrm{fs}}}{I_{m}} -1\right)(R + R_{m}) \tag{2.65}
$$

As mentioned, the types of meters we have discussed are known as analog meters and are based on the d'Arsonval meter movement. Another type of meter, called a digital meter, is based on active circuit elements

Samuel F. B. Morse (1791- 1872), an American painter, invented the telegraph, the first practical, commercialized application of electricity.

Morse was born in Charlestown, Massachusetts, and studied at Yale and the Royal Academy of Arts in London to become an artist. In the 1830s, he became intrigued with developing a telegraph. He had a working model by 1836 and applied for a patent in 1838. The U.S. Senate appropriated funds for Morse to construct a telegraph line between Baltimore and Washington, D.C. On May 24, 1844, he sent the famous first message: "What hath God wrought!" Morse also developed a code of dots and dashes for letters and numbers, for sending messages on the telegraph. The development of the telegraph led to the invention of the telephone.

such as op amps. For example, a digital multimeter displays measurements of dc or ac voltage, current, and resistance as discrete numbers, instead of using a pointer deflection on a continuous scale as in an analog multimeter. Digital meters are what you would most likely use in a modern lab. However, the design of digital meters is beyond the scope of this book.

# Example 2.17

Following the voltmeter setup of Fig. 2.60, design a voltmeter for the following multiple ranges:

(a)  $0 - 1\mathrm{V}$  
(b)  $0 - 5\mathrm{V}$  
(c)  $0 - 50\mathrm{V}$  
(d)  $0 - 100\mathrm{V}$  Assume that the internal resistance  $R_{m} = 2\mathrm{k}\Omega$  and the full-scale current  $I_{\mathrm{fs}} = 100\mu \mathrm{A}$

# Solution:

We apply Eq. (2.60) and assume that  $R_{1},R_{2},R_{3},$  and  $R_{4}$  correspond with ranges  $0 - 1\mathrm{V},0 - 5\mathrm{V},0 - 50\mathrm{V},$  and  $0 - 100\mathrm{V},$  respectively.

a) For range  $0 - 1\mathrm{V}$

$$
R_{1} = \frac{1}{100\times 10^{-6}} -2000 = 10,000 - 2000 = 8\mathrm{k}\Omega
$$

b) For range  $0 - 5\mathrm{V}$

$$
R_{2} = \frac{5}{100\times 10^{-6}} -2000 = 50,000 - 2000 = 48\mathrm{k}\Omega
$$

c) For range  $0 - 50\mathrm{V}$

$$
R_{3} = \frac{50}{100\times 10^{-6}} -2000 = 500,000 - 2000 = 498\mathrm{k}\Omega
$$

d) For range  $0 - 100\mathrm{V}$

$$
R_{4} = \frac{100\mathrm{V}}{100\times 10^{-6}} -2000 = 1,000,000 - 2000 = 998\mathrm{k}\Omega
$$

Note that the ratio of the total resistance  $(R_{n} + R_{m})$  to the full- scale voltage  $V_{\mathrm{fs}}$  is constant and equal to  $1 / I_{\mathrm{fs}}$  for the four ranges. This ratio (given in ohms per volt, or  $\Omega /\mathrm{V}$ ) is known as the sensitivity of the voltmeter. The larger the sensitivity, the better the voltmeter.

Following the ammeter setup of Fig. 2.61, design an ammeter for the following multiple ranges:

(a) 0-1 A 
(b)  $0\mathrm{-}100\mathrm{mA}$  
(c)  $0\mathrm{-}10\mathrm{mA}$  Take the full-scale meter current as  $I_{m} = 1\mathrm{mA}$  and the internal resistance of the ammeter as  $R_{m} = 50\Omega$

Answer: Shunt resistors:  $50~\mathrm{m}\Omega$ $505~\mathrm{m}\Omega$ $5.556\Omega$

# 2.9 Summary

1. A resistor is a passive element in which the voltage  $\nu$  across it is directly proportional to the current  $i$  through it. That is, a resistor is a device that obeys Ohm's law,

$$
\nu = iR
$$

where  $R$  is the resistance of the resistor.

2. A short circuit is a resistor (a perfectly, conducting wire) with zero resistance  $(R = 0)$  . An open circuit is a resistor with infinite resistance  $(R = \infty)$

3. The conductance  $G$  of a resistor is the reciprocal of its resistance:

$$
G = \frac{1}{R}
$$

4. A branch is a single two-terminal element in an electric circuit. A node is the point of connection between two or more branches. A loop is a closed path in a circuit. The number of branches  $b$  ,the number of nodes  $n$  , and the number of independent loops  $l$  in a network are related as

$$
b = l + n - 1
$$

5. Kirchhoff's current law (KCL) states that the currents at any node algebraically sum to zero. In other words, the sum of the currents entering a node equals the sum of currents leaving the node.

6. Kirchhoff's voltage law (KVL) states that the voltages around a closed path algebraically sum to zero. In other words, the sum of voltage rises equals the sum of voltage drops.

7. Two elements are in series when they are connected sequentially, end to end. When elements are in series, the same current flows through them  $(l_{1} = l_{2})$  . They are in parallel if they are connected to the same two nodes. Elements in parallel always have the same voltage across them  $(\nu_{1} = \nu_{2})$

8. When two resistors  $R_{1}(= 1 / G_{1})$  and  $R_{2}(= 1 / G_{2})$  are in series, their equivalent resistance  $R_{\mathrm{eq}}$  and equivalent conductance  $G_{\mathrm{eq}}$  are

$$
R_{\mathrm{eq}} = R_{1} + R_{2},\qquad G_{\mathrm{eq}} = \frac{G_{1}G_{2}}{G_{1} + G_{2}}
$$

9. When two resistors  $R_{1}(= 1 / G_{1})$  and  $R_{2}(= 1 / G_{2})$  are in parallel, their equivalent resistance  $R_{\mathrm{eq}}$  and equivalent conductance  $G_{\mathrm{eq}}$  are

$$
R_{\mathrm{eq}} = \frac{R_1R_2}{R_1 + R_2},\qquad G_{\mathrm{eq}} = G_1 + G_2
$$

10. The voltage division principle for two resistors in series is

$$
\nu_{1} = \frac{R_{1}}{R_{1} + R_{2}} \nu , \qquad \nu_{2} = \frac{R_{2}}{R_{1} + R_{2}} \nu
$$

11. The current division principle for two resistors in parallel is

$$
i_{1} = \frac{R_{2}}{R_{1} + R_{2}} i, \qquad i_{2} = \frac{R_{1}}{R_{1} + R_{2}} i
$$

12. The formulas for a delta-to-wye transformation are

$$
R_{1} = \frac{R_{b} R_{c}}{R_{a} + R_{b} + R_{c}}, \qquad R_{2} = \frac{R_{c} R_{a}}{R_{a} + R_{b} + R_{c}}
$$

$$
R_{3} = \frac{R_{a} R_{b}}{R_{a} + R_{b} + R_{c}}
$$

13. The formulas for a wye-to-delta transformation are

$$
R_{a} = \frac{R_{1} R_{2} + R_{2} R_{3} + R_{3} R_{1}}{R_{1}}, \qquad R_{b} = \frac{R_{1} R_{2} + R_{2} R_{3} + R_{3} R_{1}}{R_{2}}
$$

$$
R_{c} = \frac{R_{1} R_{2} + R_{2} R_{3} + R_{3} R_{1}}{R_{3}}
$$

14. The basic laws covered in this chapter can be applied to the problems of electrical lighting and design of dc meters.

# Enhancing Your Career

# Career in Electronics

One area of application for electric circuit analysis is electronics. The term electronics was originally used to distinguish circuits of very low current levels. This distinction no longer holds, as power semiconductor devices operate at high levels of current. Today, electronics is regarded as the science of the motion of charges in a gas, vacuum, or semiconductor. Modern electronics involves transistors and transistor circuits. The earlier electronic circuits were assembled from components. Many electronic circuits are now produced as integrated circuits, fabricated in a semiconductor substrate or chip.

Electronic circuits find applications in many areas, such as automation, broadcasting, computers, and instrumentation. The range of devices that use electronic circuits is enormous and is limited only by our imagination. Radio, television, computers, and stereo systems are but a few.

An electrical engineer usually performs diverse functions and is likely to use, design, or construct systems that incorporate some form of electronic circuits. Therefore, an understanding of the operation and analysis of electronics is essential to the electrical engineer. Electronics has become a specialty distinct from other disciplines within electrical engineering. Because the field of electronics is ever advancing, an electronics engineer must update his/her knowledge from time to time. The best way to do this is by being a member of a professional organization such as the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). With a membership of over 300,000, the IEEE is the largest professional organization in the world. Members benefit immensely from the numerous magazines, journals, transactions, and conference/symposium proceedings published yearly by IEEE. You should consider becoming an IEEE member.

# 3.1 Introduction

Having understood the fundamental laws of circuit theory (Ohm's law and Kirchhoff's laws), we are now prepared to apply these laws to develop two powerful techniques for circuit analysis: nodal analysis, which is based on a systematic application of Kirchhoff's current law (KCL), and mesh analysis, which is based on a systematic application of Kirchhoff's voltage law (KVL). The two techniques are so important that this chapter should be regarded as the most important in the book. Students are therefore encouraged to pay careful attention.

With the two techniques to be developed in this chapter, we can analyze any linear circuit by obtaining a set of simultaneous equations that are then solved to obtain the required values of current or voltage. One method of solving simultaneous equations involves Cramer's rule, which allows us to calculate circuit variables as a quotient of determinants. The examples in the chapter will illustrate this method; Appendix A also briefly summarizes the essentials the reader needs to know for applying Cramer's rule. Another method of solving simultaneous equations is to use MATLAB, a computer software discussed in Appendix E.

Also in this chapter, we introduce the use of PSpice for Windows, a circuit simulation computer software program that we will use throughout the text. Finally, we apply the techniques learned in this chapter to analyze transistor circuits.

# 3.2 Nodal Analysis

Nodal analysis is also known as the node- voltage method.

Nodal analysis provides a general procedure for analyzing circuits using node voltages as the circuit variables. Choosing node voltages instead of element voltages as circuit variables is convenient and reduces the number of equations one must solve simultaneously.

To simplify matters, we shall assume in this section that circuits do not contain voltage sources. Circuits that contain voltage sources will be analyzed in the next section.

In nodal analysis, we are interested in finding the node voltages. Given a circuit with n nodes without voltage sources, the nodal analysis of the circuit involves taking the following three steps.

# Steps to Determine Node Voltages:

1. Select a node as the reference node. Assign voltages  $\nu_{1}, \nu_{2}, \ldots , \nu_{n - 1}$  to the remaining  $n - 1$  nodes. The voltages are referenced with respect to the reference node.

2. Apply KCL to each of the  $n - 1$  nonreference nodes. Use Ohm's law to express the branch currents in terms of node voltages.

3. Solve the resulting simultaneous equations to obtain the unknown node voltages.

We shall now explain and apply these three steps.

The first step in nodal analysis is selecting a node as the reference or datum node. The reference node is commonly called the ground since it is assumed to have zero potential. A reference node is indicated by any of the three symbols in Fig. 3.1. The type of ground in Fig. 3.1(c) is called a chassis ground and is used in devices where the case, enclosure, or chassis acts as a reference point for all circuits. When the potential of the earth is used as reference, we use the earth ground in Fig. 3.1(a) or (b). We shall always use the symbol in Fig. 3.1(b).

Once we have selected a reference node, we assign voltage designations to nonreference nodes. Consider, for example, the circuit in Fig. 3.2(a). Node 0 is the reference node  $(\nu = 0)$ , while nodes 1 and 2 are assigned voltages  $\nu_{1}$  and  $\nu_{2}$ , respectively. Keep in mind that the node voltages are defined with respect to the reference node. As illustrated in Fig. 3.2(a), each node voltage is the voltage rise from the reference node to the corresponding nonreference node or simply the voltage of that node with respect to the reference node.

As the second step, we apply KCL to each nonreference node in the circuit. To avoid putting too much information on the same circuit, the circuit in Fig. 3.2(a) is redrawn in Fig. 3.2(b), where we now add  $i_{1}, i_{2}$ , and  $i_{3}$  as the currents through resistors  $R_{1}, R_{2}$ , and  $R_{3}$ , respectively. At node 1, applying KCL gives

$$
I_{1} = I_{2} + i_{1} + i_{2} \tag{3.1}
$$

At node 2,

$$
I_{2} + i_{2} = i_{3} \tag{3.2}
$$

We now apply Ohm's law to express the unknown currents  $i_{1}, i_{2}$ , and  $i_{3}$  in terms of node voltages. The key idea to bear in mind is that, since resistance is a passive element, by the passive sign convention, current must always flow from a higher potential to a lower potential.

Current flows from a higher potential to a lower potential in a resistor.

We can express this principle as

$$
i = \frac{\nu_{\mathrm{higher}} - \nu_{\mathrm{lower}}}{R} \tag{3.3}
$$

Figure 3.2 Typical circuit for nodal analysis.

Note that this principle is in agreement with the way we defined resistance in Chapter 2 (see Fig. 2.1). With this in mind, we obtain from Fig. 3.2(b),

$$
\begin{array}{c c c}{{i_{1}=\frac{\nu_{1}-0}{R_{1}}}}&{{\mathrm{or}}}&{{i_{1}=G_{1}\nu_{1}}}\\ {{}}&{{}}&{{}}\\ {{i_{2}=\frac{\nu_{1}-\nu_{2}}{R_{2}}}}&{{\mathrm{or}}}&{{i_{2}=G_{2}(\nu_{1}-\nu_{2})}}\\ {{}}&{{}}&{{}}\\ {{i_{3}=\frac{\nu_{2}-0}{R_{3}}}}&{{\mathrm{or}}}&{{i_{3}=G_{3}\nu_{2}}}\end{array} \tag{3.4}
$$

Substituting Eq. (3.4) in Eqs. (3.1) and (3.2) results, respectively, in

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{I_{1}=I_{2}+\frac{\nu_{1}}{R_{1}}+\frac{\nu_{1}-\nu_{2}}{R_{2}}}}\\ {{I_{2}+\frac{\nu_{1}-\nu_{2}}{R_{2}}=\frac{\nu_{2}}{R_{3}}}}\end{array} \tag{3.6}
$$

In terms of the conductances, Eqs. (3.5) and (3.6) become

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{I_{1}=I_{2}+G_{1}\nu_{1}+G_{2}(\nu_{1}-\nu_{2})}}\\ {{{}}}\\ {{I_{2}+G_{2}(\nu_{1}-\nu_{2})=G_{3}\nu_{2}}}\end{array} \tag{3.8}
$$

The third step in nodal analysis is to solve for the node voltages. If we apply KCL to  $n - 1$  nonreference nodes, we obtain  $n - 1$  simultaneous equations such as Eqs. (3.5) and (3.6) or (3.7) and (3.8). For the circuit of Fig. 3.2, we solve Eqs. (3.5) and (3.6) or (3.7) and (3.8) to obtain the node voltages  $\nu_{1}$  and  $\nu_{2}$  using any standard method, such as the substitution method, the elimination method, Cramer's rule, or matrix inversion. To use either of the last two methods, one must cast the simultaneous equations in matrix form. For example, Eqs. (3.7) and (3.8) can be cast in matrix form as

$$
\left[ \begin{array}{c c}{G_{1} + G_{2}} & {-G_{2}}\\ {-G_{2}} & {G_{2} + G_{3}} \end{array} \right]\left[ \begin{array}{c}{\nu_{1}}\\ {\nu_{2}} \end{array} \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{c}{I_{1} - I_{2}}\\ {I_{2}} \end{array} \right] \tag{3.9}
$$

which can be solved to get  $\nu_{1}$  and  $\nu_{2}$ . Equation 3.9 will be generalized in Section 3.6. The simultaneous equations may also be solved using calculators or with software packages such as MATLAB, Mathcad, Maple, and Quattro Pro.

# Example 3.1

Calculate the node voltages in the circuit shown in Fig. 3.3(a).

# Solution:

Consider Fig. 3.3(b), where the circuit in Fig. 3.3(a) has been prepared for nodal analysis. Notice how the currents are selected for the application of KCL. Except for the branches with current sources, the labeling of the currents is arbitrary but consistent. (By consistent, we mean that if, for example, we assume that  $i_{2}$  enters the  $4 - \Omega$  resistor from the left- hand side,  $i_{2}$  must leave the resistor from the right- hand side.) The reference node is selected, and the node voltages  $\nu_{1}$  and  $\nu_{2}$  are now to be determined.

At node 1, applying KCL and Ohm's law gives

$$
i_{1} = i_{2} + i_{3} \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad 5 = \frac{\nu_{1} - \nu_{2}}{4} +\frac{\nu_{1} - 0}{2}
$$

Multiplying each term in the last equation by 4, we obtain

$$
20 = \nu_{1} - \nu_{2} + 2\nu_{1}
$$

or

$$
3\nu_{1} - \nu_{2} = 20 \tag{3.1.1}
$$

At node 2, we do the same thing and get

$$
i_{2} + i_{4} = i_{1} + i_{5} \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad \frac{\nu_{1} - \nu_{2}}{4} + 10 = 5 + \frac{\nu_{2} - 0}{6}
$$

Multiplying each term by 12 results in

$$
3\nu_{1} - 3\nu_{2} + 120 = 60 + 2\nu_{2}
$$

or

$$
-3\nu_{1} + 5\nu_{2} = 60 \tag{3.1.2}
$$

Now we have two simultaneous Eqs. (3.1.1) and (3.1.2). We can solve the equations using any method and obtain the values of  $\nu_{1}$  and  $\nu_{2}$ .

METHOD 1 Using the elimination technique, we add Eqs. (3.1.1) and (3.1.2).

$$
4\nu_{2} = 80 \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad \nu_{2} = 20 \mathrm{~V}
$$

Substituting  $\nu_{2} = 20$  in Eq. (3.1.1) gives

$$
3\nu_{1} - 20 = 20 \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad \nu_{1} = \frac{40}{3} = 13.333 \mathrm{~V}
$$

METHOD 2 To use Cramer's rule, we need to put Eqs. (3.1.1) and (3.1.2) in matrix form as

$$
\left[ \begin{array}{cc}3 & -1 \\ -3 & 5 \end{array} \right] \left[ \nu_{1} \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{c}20 \\ 60 \end{array} \right] \tag{3.1.3}
$$

The determinant of the matrix is

$$
\Delta = \left[ \begin{array}{cc}3 & -1 \\ -3 & 5 \end{array} \right] = 15 - 3 = 12
$$

We now obtain  $\nu_{1}$  and  $\nu_{2}$  as

$$
\nu_{1} = \frac{\Delta_{1}}{\Delta} = \frac{\left|20 - 1\right|}{\Delta} = \frac{100 + 60}{12} = 13.333 \mathrm{~V}
$$

$$
\nu_{2} = \frac{\Delta_{2}}{\Delta} = \frac{\left| - 3 \quad 20 \right|}{\Delta} = \frac{180 + 60}{12} = 20 \mathrm{~V}
$$

giving us the same result as did the elimination method.

If we need the currents, we can easily calculate them from the values of the nodal voltages.

$$
i_{1} = 5 \mathrm{~A}, \qquad i_{2} = \frac{\nu_{1} - \nu_{2}}{4} = -1.6668 \mathrm{~A}, \qquad i_{3} = \frac{\nu_{1}}{2} = 6.666 \mathrm{~A}
$$

$$
i_{4} = 10 \mathrm{~A}, \qquad i_{5} = \frac{\nu_{2}}{6} = 3.333 \mathrm{~A}
$$

The fact that  $i_{2}$  is negative shows that the current flows in the direction opposite to the one assumed.

Figure 3.4 For Practice Prob. 3.1.

Determine the voltages at the nodes in Fig. 3.5(a).

# Solution:

The circuit in this example has three nonreference nodes, unlike the previous example which has two nonreference nodes. We assign voltages to the three nodes as shown in Fig. 3.5(b) and label the currents.

At node 1,

$$
3 = i_{1} + i_{x} \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad 3 = \frac{\nu_{1} - \nu_{3}}{4} +\frac{\nu_{1} - \nu_{2}}{2}
$$

Multiplying by 4 and rearranging terms, we get

$$
3\nu_{1} - 2\nu_{2} - \nu_{3} = 12 \tag{3.2.1}
$$

At node 2,

$$
i_{x} = i_{2} + i_{3} \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad \frac{\nu_{1} - \nu_{2}}{2} = \frac{\nu_{2} - \nu_{3}}{8} +\frac{\nu_{2} - 0}{4}
$$

Figure 3.5 For Example 3.2: (a) original circuit, (b) circuit for analysis.

Multiplying by 8 and rearranging terms, we get

$$
-4\nu_{1} + 7\nu_{2} - \nu_{3} = 0 \tag{3.2.2}
$$

At node 3,

$$
i_{1} + i_{2} = 2i_{x} \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad \frac{\nu_{1} - \nu_{3}}{4} +\frac{\nu_{2} - \nu_{3}}{8} = \frac{2(\nu_{1} - \nu_{2})}{2}
$$

Multiplying by 8, rearranging terms, and dividing by 3, we get

$$
2\nu_{1} - 3\nu_{2} + \nu_{3} = 0 \tag{3.2.3}
$$

We have three simultaneous equations to solve to get the node voltages  $\nu_{1}, \nu_{2}$ , and  $\nu_{3}$ . We shall solve the equations in three ways.

METHOD 1 Using the elimination technique, we add Eqs. (3.2.1) and (3.2.3).

$$
5\nu_{1} - 5\nu_{2} = 12
$$

or

$$
\nu_{1} - \nu_{2} = \frac{12}{5} = 2.4 \tag{3.2.4}
$$

Adding Eqs. (3.2.2) and (3.2.3) gives

$$
-2\nu_{1} + 4\nu_{2} = 0 \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad \nu_{1} = 2\nu_{2} \tag{3.2.5}
$$

Substituting Eq. (3.2.5) into Eq. (3.2.4) yields

$$
2\nu_{2} - \nu_{2} = 2.4\qquad \Rightarrow \qquad \nu_{2} = 2.4,\qquad \nu_{1} = 2\nu_{2} = 4.8 \mathrm{V}
$$

From Eq. (3.2.3), we get

$$
\nu_{3} = 3\nu_{2} - 2\nu_{1} = 3\nu_{2} - 4\nu_{2} = -\nu_{2} = -2.4 \mathrm{V}
$$

Thus,

$$
\nu_{1} = 4.8 \mathrm{V}, \qquad \nu_{2} = 2.4 \mathrm{V}, \qquad \nu_{3} = -2.4 \mathrm{V}
$$

■ METHOD 2 To use Cramer's rule, we put Eqs. (3.2.1) to (3.2.3) in matrix form.

$$
\left[ \begin{array}{rrr}3 & -2 & -1 \\ -4 & 7 & -1 \\ 2 & -3 & 1 \end{array} \right] \left[ \begin{array}{r}\nu_{1} \\ \nu_{2} \\ \nu_{3} \end{array} \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{r}12 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{array} \right] \tag{3.2.6}
$$

From this, we obtain

$$
\nu_{1} = \frac{\Delta_{1}}{\Delta}, \qquad \nu_{2} = \frac{\Delta_{2}}{\Delta}, \qquad \nu_{3} = \frac{\Delta_{3}}{\Delta}
$$

where  $\Delta$ ,  $\Delta_{1}$ ,  $\Delta_{2}$ , and  $\Delta_{3}$  are the determinants to be calculated as follows. As explained in Appendix A, to calculate the determinant of a 3 by 3 matrix, we repeat the first two rows and cross multiply.

$$
\Delta = \left| \begin{array}{rrr}3 & -2 & -1 \\ -4 & 7 & -1 \\ 2 & -3 & 1 \end{array} \right| = \left| \begin{array}{r}3 - 2 - 1 \\ -4 - 3 - 1 \\ -2 - 3 - 1 \\ -3 - 2 - 1 \\ -4 - 7 - 1 \end{array} \right| + \left| \begin{array}{r}3 - 2 - 1 \\ -4 - 3 - 1 \\ -2 - 3 - 1 \\ -3 - 2 - 1 \\ -4 - 7 - 1 \end{array} \right| + \left| \begin{array}{r}3 - 2 - 1 \\ -4 - 3 - 1 \\ -2 - 3 - 1 \\ -4 - 7 - 1 \end{array} \right|.
$$

$$
= 21 - 12 + 4 + 14 - 9 - 8 = 10
$$

Similarly, we obtain

$$
\Delta_{1} = \left| \begin{array}{l}12 - 2 - 1 \\ -4 - 7 - 1 \\ -3 - 1 \\ -2 - 3 - 1 \\ -1 - 2 - 1 \\ -1 - 2 - 1 \\ -1 - 2 - 1 \\ -1 - 2 - 1 \\ -1 - 2 - 1 \\ -1 - 2 - 1 \\ -1 - 2 - 1 \\ -1 - 2 - 1 \\ -1 - 2 - 1 \\ -1 - 2 - 1 \\ -1 - 2 - 1 \\ -1 - 2 + 14 - 0 - 168 - 0 - 0 = -24 \end{array} \right|
$$

$$
\Delta_{2} = \left| \begin{array}{l}3 - 12 - 1 \\ -4 - 0 - 1 \\ -3 - 0 - 1 \\ -2 - 1 \\ -1 - 2 - 1 \\ -1 - 2 - 1 \\ -1 - 2 - 1 \\ -1 - 2 - 1 \\ -1 - 2 - 1 \\ -1 - 2 - 1 \\ -1 - 2 - 1 \\ -1 - 2 - 1 \\ -1 - 2 - 1 \\ -1 - 2 - 1 \\ -1 - 1 - 2 - 1 \\ -1 - 2 - 1 \\ -1 - 2 - 1 \\ -1 - 2 - 1 \\ -1 - 2 - 1 \\ -1 - 2 - 1 \\ -1 - 2 - 1 \\ -1 - 2 - 1 \\ -1 - 2 - 1 \\ -1 - 2 - 1 \\ -1 - 2 - 1 \\ -2 - 1 \\ -1 - 2 - 1 \\ -1 - 2 - 1 \\ -1 - 2 - 1 \\ -1 - 2 - 1 \\ -1 - 2 - 1 \\ -1 - 2 - 1 \\ -1 - 2 - 1 \\ -1 - 2 - 1 \\ -1 - 2 - 1 \\ -1 - 2 - 1 \end{array} \right| = 0 + 0 - 24 - 0 - 0 + 48 = 24
$$

$$
\Delta_{3} = \left| \begin{array}{l}3 - 2 - 12 \\ -4 - 7 - 0 \\ -2 - 3 - 0 \\ -1 - 2 - 1 \\ -1 - 2 - 1 \\ -1 - 2 - 1 \\ -1 - 2 - 1 \\ -1 - 2 - 1 \\ -1 - 2 - 1 \\ -1 - 2 - 1 \\ -1 - 2 - 1 \\ -1 - 2 - 1 \\ -1 - 2 - 1 \\ -1 - 2 - 1 \end{array} + \right| = 0 + 144 + 0 - 168 - 0 - 0 = -24
$$

Thus, we find

$$
\nu_{1} = \frac{\Delta_{1}}{\Delta} = \frac{48}{10} = 4.8 \mathrm{V}, \qquad \nu_{2} = \frac{\Delta_{2}}{\Delta} = \frac{24}{10} = 2.4 \mathrm{V}
$$

$$
\nu_{3} = \frac{\Delta_{3}}{\Delta} = \frac{-24}{10} = -2.4 \mathrm{V}
$$

as we obtained with Method 1.

METHOD 3 We now use MATLAB to solve the matrix. Equation (3.2.6) can be written as

$$
\mathbf{A}\mathbf{V} = \mathbf{B} \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad \mathbf{V} = \mathbf{A}^{-1}\mathbf{B}
$$

where  $\mathbf{A}$  is the 3 by 3 square matrix,  $\mathbf{B}$  is the column vector, and  $\mathbf{V}$  is a column vector comprised of  $\nu_{1}, \nu_{2}$ , and  $\nu_{3}$  that we want to determine. We use MATLAB to determine  $\mathbf{V}$  as follows:

$$
\begin{array}{r l} & {> > \mathrm{A} = [3 - 2 - 1; - 47 - 1;2 - 31];}\\ & {> > \mathrm{B} = [1200];}\\ & {> > \mathrm{V} = \mathrm{inv}(\mathrm{A})*\mathrm{B}}\\ & {\qquad 4.8000}\\ & {\qquad \mathrm{V} = \mathrm{\frac{4.8000}{2.4000}}}\\ & {\qquad -2.4000} \end{array}
$$

Thus,  $\nu_{1} = 4.8 \mathrm{V}, \nu_{2} = 2.4 \mathrm{V}$ , and  $\nu_{3} = - 2.4 \mathrm{V}$ , as obtained previously.

# 3.3 Nodal Analysis with Voltage Sources

We now consider how voltage sources affect nodal analysis. We use the circuit in Fig. 3.7 for illustration. Consider the following two possibilities.

CASE 1 If a voltage source is connected between the reference node and a nonreference node, we simply set the voltage at the nonreference node equal to the voltage of the voltage source. In Fig. 3.7, for example,

$$
\nu_{1} = 10 \mathrm{V} \tag{3.10}
$$

Thus, our analysis is somewhat simplified by this knowledge of the voltage at this node.

CASE 2 If the voltage source (dependent or independent) is connected between two nonreference nodes, the two nonreference nodes

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-13/c95faf42-d8e0-4f06-a665-945fc5e108f1/d3d869a01606a2fd36f0efc11cf8739f5ce5aac5dfe590605667f50794e0e67d.jpg)  
Figure 3.7A circuit with a supernode.

form a generalized node or supernode; we apply both KCL and KVL to determine the node voltages.

A supernode is formed by enclosing a (dependent or independent) voltage source connected between two nonreference nodes and any elements connected in parallel with it.

In Fig. 3.7, nodes 2 and 3 form a supernode. (We could have more than two nodes forming a single supernode. For example, see the circuit in Fig. 3.14. ) We analyze a circuit with supernodes using the same three steps mentioned in the previous section except that the supernodes are treated differently. Why? Because an essential component of nodal analysis is applying KCL, which requires knowing the current through each element. There is no way of knowing the current through a voltage source in advance. However, KCL must be satisfied at a supernode like any other node. Hence, at the supernode in Fig. 3.7,

$$
i_{1} + i_{4} = i_{2} + i_{3} \tag{3.11a}
$$

or

$$
\frac{\nu_1 - \nu_2}{2} +\frac{\nu_1 - \nu_3}{4} = \frac{\nu_2 - 0}{8} +\frac{\nu_3 - 0}{6} \tag{3.11b}
$$

To apply Kirchhoff's voltage law to the supernode in Fig. 3.7, we redraw the circuit as shown in Fig. 3.8. Going around the loop in the clockwise direction gives

$$
\nu_{2} + 5 + \nu_{3} = 0\qquad \Rightarrow \qquad \nu_{2} - \nu_{3} = 5 \tag{3.12}
$$

From Eqs. (3.10), (3.11b), and (3.12), we obtain the node voltages.

Note the following properties of a supernode:

1. The voltage source inside the supernode provides a constraint equation needed to solve for the node voltages. 
2. A supernode has no voltage of its own. 
3. A supernode requires the application of both KCL and KVL.

A supernode may be regarded as a closed surface enclosing the voltage source and its two nodes.

Figure 3.9 For Example 3.3.

For the circuit shown in Fig. 3.9, find the node voltages.

# Solution:

The supernode contains the 2- V source, nodes 1 and 2, and the  $10 - \Omega$  resistor. Applying KCL to the supernode as shown in Fig. 3.10(a) gives

$$
2 = i_{1} + i_{2} + 7
$$

Expressing  $i_{1}$  and  $i_{2}$  in terms of the node voltages

$$
2 = \frac{\nu_{1} - 0}{2} +\frac{\nu_{2} - 0}{4} +7\qquad \Rightarrow \qquad 8 = 2\nu_{1} + \nu_{2} + 28
$$

or

$$
\nu_{2} = -20 - 2\nu_{1} \tag{3.3.1}
$$

To get the relationship between  $\nu_{1}$  and  $\nu_{2}$ , we apply KVL to the circuit in Fig. 3.10(b). Going around the loop, we obtain

$$
-\nu_{1} - 2 + \nu_{2} = 0\qquad \Rightarrow \qquad \nu_{2} = \nu_{1} + 2 \tag{3.3.2}
$$

From Eqs. (3.3.1) and (3.3.2), we write

$$
\nu_{2} = \nu_{1} + 2 = -20 - 2\nu_{1}
$$

or

$$
3\nu_{1} = -22\qquad \Rightarrow \qquad \nu_{1} = -7.333\mathrm{~V}
$$

and  $\nu_{2} = \nu_{1} + 2 = - 5.333\mathrm{~V}$ . Note that the  $10 - \Omega$  resistor does not make any difference because it is connected across the supernode.

Figure 3.12 For Example 3.4.

# Solution:

Nodes 1 and 2 form a supernode; so do nodes 3 and 4. We apply KCL to the two supernodes as in Fig. 3.13(a). At supernode 1- 2,

$$
i_{3} + 10 = i_{1} + i_{2}
$$

Expressing this in terms of the node voltages,

$$
\frac{\nu_{3} - \nu_{2}}{6} +10 = \frac{\nu_{1} - \nu_{4}}{3} +\frac{\nu_{1}}{2}
$$

or

$$
5\nu_{1} + \nu_{2} - \nu_{3} - 2\nu_{4} = 60 \tag{3.4.1}
$$

At supernode 3- 4,

$$
i_{1} = i_{3} + i_{4} + i_{5}\qquad \Rightarrow \qquad \frac{\nu_{1} - \nu_{4}}{3} = \frac{\nu_{3} - \nu_{2}}{6} +\frac{\nu_{4}}{1} +\frac{\nu_{3}}{4}
$$

or

$$
4\nu_{1} + 2\nu_{2} - 5\nu_{3} - 16\nu_{4} = 0 \tag{3.4.2}
$$

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-13/c95faf42-d8e0-4f06-a665-945fc5e108f1/9b82c26f0a33aecea4a0a2f9f3f3ba3e1f4882b089fed60970b051bae5b90bdd.jpg)  
Figure 3.13 Applying: (a) KCL to the two supernodes, (b) KVL to the loops.

We now apply KVL to the branches involving the voltage sources as shown in Fig. 3.13(b). For loop 1,

$$
-\nu_{1} + 20 + \nu_{2} = 0\qquad \Rightarrow \qquad \nu_{1} - \nu_{2} = 20 \tag{3.4.3}
$$

For loop 2,

$$
-\nu_{3} + 3\nu_{x} + \nu_{4} = 0
$$

But  $\nu_{x} = \nu_{1} - \nu_{4}$  so that

$$
3\nu_{1} - \nu_{3} - 2\nu_{4} = 0 \tag{3.4.4}
$$

For loop 3,

$$
\nu_{x} - 3\nu_{x} + 6i_{3} - 20 = 0
$$

But  $6i_{3} = \nu_{3} - \nu_{2}$  and  $\nu_{x} = \nu_{1} - \nu_{4}$ . Hence,

$$
-2\nu_{1} - \nu_{2} + \nu_{3} + 2\nu_{4} = 20 \tag{3.4.5}
$$

We need four node voltages,  $\nu_{1}, \nu_{2}, \nu_{3}$ , and  $\nu_{4}$ , and it requires only four out of the five Eqs. (3.4.1) to (3.4.5) to find them. Although the fifth equation is redundant, it can be used to check results. We can solve Eqs. (3.4.1) to (3.4.4) directly using MATLAB. We can eliminate one node voltage so that we solve three simultaneous equations instead of four. From Eq. (3.4.3),  $\nu_{2} = \nu_{1} - 20$ . Substituting this into Eqs. (3.4.1) and (3.4.2), respectively, gives

$$
6\nu_{1} - \nu_{3} - 2\nu_{4} = 80 \tag{3.4.6}
$$

and

$$
6\nu_{1} - 5\nu_{3} - 16\nu_{4} = 40 \tag{3.4.7}
$$

Equations (3.4.4), (3.4.6), and (3.4.7) can be cast in matrix form as

$$
\left[ \begin{array}{rrr}3 & -1 & -2 \\ 6 & -1 & -2 \\ 6 & -5 & -16 \end{array} \right]\left[ \begin{array}{r}\nu_{1} \\ \nu_{3} \\ \nu_{4} \end{array} \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{r}0 \\ 80 \\ 40 \end{array} \right]
$$

Using Cramer's rule gives

$$
\begin{array}{r l} & {\Delta = \left| \begin{array}{r r r}{3} & {-1} & {-2}\\ {6} & {-1} & {-2}\\ {6} & {-5} & {-16} \end{array} \right| = -18,\qquad \Delta_{1} = \left| \begin{array}{r r r}{0} & {-1} & {-2}\\ {80} & {-1} & {-2}\\ {40} & {-5} & {-16} \end{array} \right| = -480,}\\ & {\Delta_{3} = \left| \begin{array}{r r r}{3} & {0} & {-2}\\ {6} & {80} & {-2}\\ {6} & {40} & {-16} \end{array} \right| = -3120,\qquad \Delta_{4} = \left| \begin{array}{r r r}{3} & {-1} & {0}\\ {6} & {-1} & {80}\\ {6} & {-5} & {40} \end{array} \right| = 840} \end{array}
$$

Thus, we arrive at the node voltages as

$$
\nu_{1} = \frac{\Delta_{1}}{\Delta} = \frac{-480}{-18} = 26.67 \mathrm{~V}, \qquad \nu_{3} = \frac{\Delta_{3}}{\Delta} = \frac{-3120}{-18} = 173.33 \mathrm{~V},
$$

$$
\nu_{4} = \frac{\Delta_{4}}{\Delta} = \frac{840}{-18} = -46.67 \mathrm{~V}
$$

and  $\nu_{2} = \nu_{1} - 20 = 6.667 \mathrm{~V}$ . We have not used Eq. (3.4.5); it can be used to cross- check results.

Find  $\nu_{1}$ ,  $\nu_{2}$ , and  $\nu_{3}$  in the circuit of Fig. 3.14 using nodal analysis.

Answer:  $\nu_{1} = 7.608 \mathrm{V}$ ,  $\nu_{2} = - 17.39 \mathrm{V}$ ,  $\nu_{3} = 1.6305 \mathrm{V}$ .

# 3.4 Mesh Analysis

Mesh analysis provides another general procedure for analyzing circuits, using mesh currents as the circuit variables. Using mesh currents instead of element currents as circuit variables is convenient and reduces the number of equations that must be solved simultaneously. Recall that a loop is a closed path with no node passed more than once. A mesh is a loop that does not contain any other loop within it.

Nodal analysis applies KCL to find unknown voltages in a given circuit, while mesh analysis applies KVL to find unknown currents. Mesh analysis is not quite as general as nodal analysis because it is only applicable to a circuit that is planar. A planar circuit is one that can be drawn in a plane with no branches crossing one another; otherwise it is nonplanar. A circuit may have crossing branches and still be planar if it can be redrawn such that it has no crossing branches. For example, the circuit in Fig. 3.15(a) has two crossing branches, but it can be redrawn as in Fig. 3.15(b). Hence, the circuit in Fig. 3.15(a) is planar. However, the circuit in Fig. 3.16 is nonplanar, because there is no way to redraw it and avoid the branches crossing. Nonplanar circuits can be handled using nodal analysis, but they will not be considered in this text.

To understand mesh analysis, we should first explain more about what we mean by a mesh.

A mesh is a loop that does not contain any other loops within it.

Figure 3.17 A circuit with two meshes.

Although path abcdefa is a loop and not a mesh, KVL still holds. This is the reason for loosely using the terms loop analysis and mesh analysis to mean the same thing.

In Fig. 3.17, for example, paths abefa and bcdeb are meshes, but path abcdefa is not a mesh. The current through a mesh is known as mesh current. In mesh analysis, we are interested in applying KVL to find the mesh currents in a given circuit.

In this section, we will apply mesh analysis to planar circuits that do not contain current sources. In the next section, we will consider circuits with current sources. In the mesh analysis of a circuit with  $n$  meshes, we take the following three steps.

# Steps to Determine Mesh Currents:

1. Assign mesh currents  $i_{1}, i_{2}, \ldots , i_{n}$  to the  $n$  meshes.  
2. Apply KVL to each of the  $n$  meshes. Use Ohm's law to express the voltages in terms of the mesh currents.  
3. Solve the resulting  $n$  simultaneous equations to get the mesh currents.

The direction of the mesh current is arbitrary- (clockwise or counterclockwise)- and does not affect the validity of the solution.

To illustrate the steps, consider the circuit in Fig. 3.17. The first step requires that mesh currents  $i_{1}$  and  $i_{2}$  are assigned to meshes 1 and 2. Although a mesh current may be assigned to each mesh in an arbitrary direction, it is conventional to assume that each mesh current flows clockwise.

As the second step, we apply KVL to each mesh. Applying KVL to mesh 1, we obtain

$$
-V_{1} + R_{1}i_{1} + R_{3}(i_{1} - i_{2}) = 0
$$

or

$$
(R_{1} + R_{3})i_{1} - R_{3}i_{2} = V_{1} \tag{3.13}
$$

For mesh 2, applying KVL gives

$$
R_{2}i_{2} + V_{2} + R_{3}(i_{2} - i_{1}) = 0
$$

or

$$
-R_{3}i_{1} + (R_{2} + R_{3})i_{2} = -V_{2} \tag{3.14}
$$

The shortcut way will not apply if one mesh current is assumed clockwise and the other assumed counterclockwise, although this is permissible.

Note in Eq. (3.13) that the coefficient of  $i_{1}$  is the sum of the resistances in the first mesh, while the coefficient of  $i_{2}$  is the negative of the resistance common to meshes 1 and 2. Now observe that the same is true in Eq. (3.14). This can serve as a shortcut way of writing the mesh equations. We will exploit this idea in Section 3.6.

The third step is to solve for the mesh currents. Putting Eqs. (3.13) and (3.14) in matrix form yields

$$
\left[ \begin{array}{cc}R_{1} + R_{3} & -R_{3} \\ -R_{3} & R_{2} + R_{3} \end{array} \right]\left[ \begin{array}{c}i_{1} \\ i_{2} \end{array} \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{c}V_{1} \\ -V_{2} \end{array} \right] \tag{3.15}
$$

which can be solved to obtain the mesh currents  $i_{1}$  and  $i_{2}$ . We are at liberty to use any technique for solving the simultaneous equations. According to Eq. (2.12), if a circuit has  $n$  nodes,  $b$  branches, and  $l$  independent loops or meshes, then  $l = b - n + 1$ . Hence,  $l$  independent simultaneous equations are required to solve the circuit using mesh analysis.

Notice that the branch currents are different from the mesh currents unless the mesh is isolated. To distinguish between the two types of currents, we use  $I$  for a mesh current and  $I$  for a branch current. The current elements  $I_{1}, I_{2}$ , and  $I_{3}$  are algebraic sums of the mesh currents. It is evident from Fig. 3.17 that

$$
I_{1} = i_{1}, \qquad I_{2} = i_{2}, \qquad I_{3} = i_{1} - i_{2} \tag{3.16}
$$

For the circuit in Fig. 3.18, find the branch currents  $I_{1}, I_{2}$ , and  $I_{3}$  using mesh analysis.

# Solution:

We first obtain the mesh currents using KVL. For mesh 1,

$$

For mesh 2,

$$
6i_{2} + 4i_{2} + 10(i_{2} - i_{1}) - 10 = 0
$$

or

$$
i_{1} = 2i_{2} - 1 \tag{3.5.2}
$$

METHOD 1 Using the substitution method, we substitute Eq. (3.5.2) into Eq. (3.5.1), and write

$$
6i_{2} - 3 - 2i_{2} = 1 \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad i_{2} = 1 \mathrm{~A}
$$

From Eq. (3.5.2),  $i_{1} = 2i_{2} - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1$  A. Thus,

$$
I_{1} = i_{1} = 1 \mathrm{~A}, \qquad I_{2} = i_{2} = 1 \mathrm{~A}, \qquad I_{3} = i_{1} - i_{2} = 0
$$

METHOD 2 To use Cramer's rule, we cast Eqs. (3.5.1) and (3.5.2) in matrix form as

$$
\left[ \begin{array}{cc}3 & -2 \\ -1 & 2 \end{array} \right]\left[ \begin{array}{c}i_{1} \\ i_{2} \end{array} \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{c}1 \\ 1 \end{array} \right]
$$

We obtain the determinants

$$
\begin{array}{c c}{{\Delta=\left|\begin{array}{c c}{{3}}&{{-2}}\\ {{-1}}&{{2}}\end{array}\right|=6-2=4}}\\ {{\Delta_{1}=\left|\begin{array}{c c}{{1}}&{{-2}}\\ {{1}}&{{2}}\end{array}\right|=2+2=4,\qquad\Delta_{2}=\left|\begin{array}{c c}{{3}}&{{1}}\\ {{-1}}&{{1}}\end{array}\right|=3+1=4}}\end{array}
$$

Thus,

$$
i_{1} = \frac{\Delta_{1}}{\Delta} = 1 \mathrm{A}, \qquad i_{2} = \frac{\Delta_{2}}{\Delta} = 1 \mathrm{A}
$$

as before.

# Solution:

We apply KVL to the three meshes in turn. For mesh 1,

Figure 3.20 For Example 3.6.

or

For mesh 2,

$$
11i_{1} - 5i_{2} - 6i_{3} = 12 \tag{3.6.1}
$$

$$
24i_{2} + 4(i_{2} - i_{3}) + 10(i_{2} - i_{1}) = 0
$$

$$
-5i_{1} + 19i_{2} - 2i_{3} = 0 \tag{3.6.2}
$$

For mesh 3,

$$
4I_{o} + 12(i_{3} - i_{1}) + 4(i_{3} - i_{2}) = 0
$$

But at node A,  $I_{o} = i_{1} - i_{2}$ , so that

$$
4(i_{1} - i_{2}) + 12(i_{3} - i_{1}) + 4(i_{3} - i_{2}) = 0
$$

or

$$
-i_{1} - i_{2} + 2i_{3} = 0 \tag{3.6.3}
$$

In matrix form, Eqs. (3.6.1) to (3.6.3) become

$$
\left[ \begin{array}{ccc}11 & -5 & -6 \\ -5 & 19 & -2 \\ -1 & -1 & 2 \end{array} \right]\left[ \begin{array}{c}i_{1} \\ i_{2} \\ i_{3} \end{array} \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{c}12 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{array} \right]
$$

We obtain the determinants as

$$
\Delta = | \begin{array}{c}11 - 5 \\ -5 \\ -1 \\ -5 \\ -1 \end{array} | | \begin{array}{c} - 5 \\ -2 \\ -1 \\ -5 \\ -1 \end{array} | + | \begin{array}{c}1 \\ -2 \\ -1 \\ -5 \\ -1 \end{array} | + | \begin{array}{c}1 \\ -2 \\ -1 \\ -5 \\ -1 \end{array} | + | \begin{array}{c}1 \\ -2 \\ -1 \\ -5 \\ -1 \end{array} | + | \begin{array}{c}1 \\ -2\\ -1 \\ -5 \\ -1 \end{array} | + | \begin{array}{c}1 \\ -2 \\ -1 \\ -5 \\ -1 \end{array} | + | \begin{array}{c}1 \\ -2 \\ -1 \\ -5 \\ -1 \end{array} | + | \begin{array}{c}1 \\ -2 \\ -1 \\ 1 \\ -5 \\ -1 \end{array} | + | \begin{array}{c}1 \\ -2 \\ -1 \\ -5 \\ -1 \end{array} | + | \begin{array}{c}1 \\ -2 \\ -1 \\ -5 \\ -1 \end{array} | + | \begin{array}{c}1 \\ -2 \\ -1 \\ -2 \\ -1 \\ -2 \\ -1 \end{array} | + | \begin{array}{c}1 \\ -2 \\ -1 \\ -2 \\ -1 \\ -2 \\ -1 \end{array} | + | \begin{array}{c}1 \\ -2 \\ -1 \\ -2 \\ -1 \\ -2 \\ -1 \end{array} | + | \begin{array}{c}1\\ -2 \\ -1 \\ -2 \\ -1 \\ -2 \\ -1 \end{array} | + | \begin{array}{c}1 \\ -2 \\ -1 \\ -2 \\ -1 \\ -2 \\ -1 \end{array} | + | \begin{array}{c}1 \\ -2 \\ -1 \\ -2 \\ -1 \\ -2 \\ -1 \end{array} | \begin{array}{c}1 \\ -2 \\ -1 \\ -2 \\ -1 \\ -2 \\ -1 \end{array} | + | \begin{array}{c}1 \\ -2 \\ -1 \\ -2 \\ -1 \\ -2 \\ -1 \end{array} | + | \begin{array}{c}1 \\ -2 \\ -1 \\ -2 \\ -1 \end{array} | + | \begin{array}{c}1 \\ -2 \\ -1 \\ -2 \\ -1 \end{array} | + | \begin{array}{c}1 \\ -2 \\ -1 \\ -2 \\ -1 \end{array} | + | \begin{array}{c}1 \\ -1 \\ -2 \\ -1 \\ -2 \\ -1 \end{array} | + | \begin{array}{c}1 \\ -2 \\ -1 \\ -2 \\ -1 \end{array} | + | \begin{array}{c}1 \\ -2 \\ -1 \\ -2 \\ -1 \end{array} | + | \begin{array}{c}1\\ -2 \\ -1 \\ -2 \\ -1 \end{array} | + | \begin{array}{c}1 \\ -2 \\ -1 \\ -2 \\ -1 \end{array} | + | \begin{array}{c}1 \\ -2 \\ -1 \\ -2 \\ -1 \end{array} | + | \begin{array}{c}1 \\ -2 \\

$$

We calculate the mesh currents using Cramer's rule as

$$
i_{1} = \frac{\Delta_{1}}{\Delta} = \frac{432}{192} = 2.25 \mathrm{~A}, \qquad i_{2} = \frac{\Delta_{2}}{\Delta} = \frac{144}{192} = 0.75 \mathrm{~A},
$$

$$
i_{3} = \frac{\Delta_{3}}{\Delta} = \frac{288}{192} = 1.5 \mathrm{~A}
$$

Thus,  $I_{o} = i_{1} - i_{2} = 1.5 \mathrm{~A}$ .

Using mesh analysis, find  $I_{o}$  in the circuit of Fig. 3.21.

Answer:  $- 4\mathrm{A}$ .

# 3.5 Mesh Analysis with Current Sources

Applying mesh analysis to circuits containing current sources (dependent or independent) may appear complicated. But it is actually much easier than what we encountered in the previous section, because the presence of the current sources reduces the number of equations. Consider the following two possible cases.

CASE 1 When a current source exists only in one mesh: Consider the circuit in Fig. 3.22, for example. We set  $i_{2} = - 5\mathrm{A}$  and write a mesh equation for the other mesh in the usual way; that is,

$$
-10 + 4i_{1} + 6(i_{1} - i_{2}) = 0\qquad \Rightarrow \qquad i_{1} = -2\mathrm{A} \tag{3.17}
$$

CASE 2 When a current source exists between two meshes: Consider the circuit in Fig. 3.23(a), for example. We create a supermesh by excluding the current source and any elements connected in series with it, as shown in Fig. 3.23(b). Thus,

A supermesh results when two meshes have a (dependent or independent) current source in common.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-13/c95faf42-d8e0-4f06-a665-945fc5e108f1/6dd2f38648d37ca2bf1763cfd54523a0d5d716a88cea5af66096d7fa87388984.jpg)  
Figure 3.23 (a) Two meshes having a current source in common, (b) a supermesh, created by excluding the current source.

As shown in Fig. 3.23(b), we create a supermesh as the periphery of the two meshes and treat it differently. (If a circuit has two or more supermeshes that intersect, they should be combined to form a larger supermesh.) Why treat the supermesh differently? Because mesh analysis applies KVL—which requires that we know the voltage across each branch—and we do not know the voltage across a current source in advance. However, a supermesh must satisfy KVL like any other mesh. Therefore, applying KVL to the supermesh in Fig. 3.23(b) gives

$$
-20 + 6i_{1} + 10i_{2} + 4i_{2} = 0
$$

or

$$
6i_{1} + 14i_{2} = 20 \tag{3.18}
$$

We apply KCL to a node in the branch where the two meshes intersect. Applying KCL to node 0 in Fig. 3.23(a) gives

$$
i_{2} = i_{1} + 6 \tag{3.19}
$$

Solving Eqs. (3.18) and (3.19), we get

$$
i_{1} = -3.2\mathrm{A},\qquad i_{2} = 2.8\mathrm{A} \tag{3.20}
$$

Note the following properties of a supermesh:

1. The current source in the supermesh provides the constraint

equation necessary to solve for the mesh currents.

2. A supermesh has no current of its own.

3. A supermesh requires the application of both KVL and KCL.

For the circuit in Fig. 3.24, find  $i_{1}$  to  $i_{4}$  using mesh analysis.

Example 3.7

Figure 3.24 For Example 3.7.

# Solution:

Note that meshes 1 and 2 form a supermesh because they have an independent current source in common. Also, meshes 2 and 3 form another supermesh because they have a dependent current source in common. The two supermeshes intersect and form a larger supermesh as shown. Applying KVL to the larger supermesh,

$$
2i_{1} + 4i_{3} + 8(i_{3} - i_{4}) + 6i_{2} = 0
$$

or

$$
i_{1} + 3i_{2} + 6i_{3} - 4i_{4} = 0 \tag{3.7.1}
$$

For the independent current source, we apply KCL to node  $P$ :

$$
i_{2} = i_{1} + 5 \tag{3.7.2}
$$

For the dependent current source, we apply KCL to node  $Q$ :

$$
i_{2} = i_{3} + 3I_{o}
$$

But  $I_{o} = - i_{4}$ , hence,

$$
i_{2} = i_{3} - 3i_{4} \tag{3.7.3}
$$

Applying KVL in mesh 4,

$$
2i_{4} + 8(i_{4} - i_{3}) + 10 = 0
$$

or

$$
5i_{4} - 4i_{3} = -5 \tag{3.7.4}
$$

From Eqs. (3.7.1) to (3.7.4),

$$
i_{1} = -7.5\mathrm{~A},\qquad i_{2} = -2.5\mathrm{~A},\qquad i_{3} = 3.93\mathrm{~A},\qquad i_{4} = 2.143\mathrm{~A}

# 3.6 Nodal and Mesh Analyses by Inspection

This section presents a generalized procedure for nodal or mesh analysis. It is a shortcut approach based on mere inspection of a circuit.

When all sources in a circuit are independent current sources, we do not need to apply KCL to each node to obtain the node- voltage equations as we did in Section 3.2. We can obtain the equations by mere inspection of the circuit. As an example, let us reexamine the circuit in Fig. 3.2, shown again in Fig. 3.26(a) for convenience. The circuit has two nonreference nodes and the node equations were derived in Section 3.2 as

$$
\left[ \begin{array}{c c}{G_{1} + G_{2}} & {-G_{2}}\\ {-G_{2}} & {G_{2} + G_{3}} \end{array} \right]\left[ \begin{array}{c}{\nu_{1}}\\ {\nu_{2}} \end{array} \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{c}{I_{1} - I_{2}}\\ {I_{2}} \end{array} \right] \tag{3.21}
$$

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-13/c95faf42-d8e0-4f06-a665-945fc5e108f1/ba09292923f637a67e9e5a6a7ff88eade1c1bed14e57dd31f0fdb192fe1d3265.jpg)  
Figure 3.26 (a) The circuit in Fig. 3.2, (b) the circuit in Fig. 3.17.

Observe that each of the diagonal terms is the sum of the conductances connected directly to node 1 or 2, while the off- diagonal terms are the negatives of the conductances connected between the nodes. Also, each term on the right- hand side of Eq. (3.21) is the algebraic sum of the currents entering the node.

In general, if a circuit with independent current sources has  $N$  nonreference nodes, the node- voltage equations can be written in terms of the conductances as

$$
\left[ \begin{array}{c c c c}{G_{11}} & {G_{12}} & \dots & {G_{1N}}\\ {G_{21}} & {G_{22}} & \dots & {G_{2N}}\\ \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\ {G_{N1}} & {G_{N2}} & \dots & {G_{NN}} \end{array} \right]\left[ \begin{array}{c}{\nu_{1}}\\ {\nu_{2}}\\ \vdots \\ {\nu_{N}} \end{array} \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{c}{i_{1}}\\ {i_{2}}\\ \vdots \\ {i_{N}} \end{array} \right] \tag{3.22}
$$

or simply

$$
\mathbf{G}\mathbf{v} = \mathbf{i} \tag{3.23}
$$

where

$G_{kk} = \mathrm{Sum}$  of the conductances connected to node  $k$ $G_{kj} = G_{jk} =$  Negative of the sum of the conductances directly connecting nodes  $k$  and  $j,k\neq j$ $\nu_{k} =$  Unknown voltage at node  $k$ $i_{k} = \mathrm{Sum}$  of all independent current sources directly connected to node  $k$  , with currents entering the node treated as positive

$\mathbf{G}$  is called the conductance matrix;  $\mathbf{v}$  is the output vector; and  $\mathbf{i}$  is the input vector. Equation (3.22) can be solved to obtain the unknown node voltages. Keep in mind that this is valid for circuits with only independent current sources and linear resistors.

Similarly, we can obtain mesh- current equations by inspection when a linear resistive circuit has only independent voltage sources. Consider the circuit in Fig. 3.17, shown again in Fig. 3.26(b) for convenience. The circuit has two nonreference nodes and the node equations were derived in Section 3.4 as

$$
\left[ \begin{array}{cc}R_{1} + R_{3} & -R_{3}\\ -R_{3} & R_{2} + R_{3} \end{array} \right]\left[ \begin{array}{c}i_{1}\\ i_{2} \end{array} \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{c}\nu_{1}\\ -\nu_{2} \end{array} \right] \tag{3.24}
$$

We notice that each of the diagonal terms is the sum of the resistances in the related mesh, while each of the off- diagonal terms is the negative of the resistance common to meshes 1 and 2. Each term on the right- hand side of Eq. (3.24) is the algebraic sum taken clockwise of all independent voltage sources in the related mesh.

In general, if the circuit has  $N$  meshes, the mesh- current equations can be expressed in terms of the resistances as

$$
\left[ \begin{array}{cccc}R_{11} & R_{12} & \dots & R_{1N}\\ R_{21} & R_{22} & \dots & R_{2N}\\ \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\ R_{N1} & R_{N2} & \dots & R_{NN} \end{array} \right]\left[ \begin{array}{c}i_{1}\\ i_{2}\\ \vdots \\ i_{N} \end{array} \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{c}\nu_{1}\\ \nu_{2}\\ \vdots \\ \nu_{N} \end{array} \right] \tag{3.25}
$$

or simply

$$
\mathbf{R}\mathbf{i} = \mathbf{v} \tag{3.26}
$$

where

$R_{kk} = \mathrm{Sum}$  of the resistances in mesh  $k$

$R_{kj} = R_{jk} =$  Negative of the sum of the resistances in common with meshes  $k$  and  $j,k\neq j$

$i_{k} =$  Unknown mesh current for mesh  $k$  in the clockwise direction

$\nu_{k} = \mathrm{Sum}$  taken clockwise of all independent voltage sources in

mesh  $k$  with voltage rise treated as positive

$\mathbf{R}$  is called the resistance matrix;  $\mathbf{i}$  is the output vector; and  $\mathbf{v}$  is the input vector. We can solve Eq. (3.25) to obtain the unknown mesh currents.

# Example 3.8

Figure 3.27 For Example 3.8.

# Solution:

The circuit in Fig. 3.27 has four nonreference nodes, so we need four node equations. This implies that the size of the conductance matrix  $\mathbf{G}$  is 4 by 4. The diagonal terms of  $\mathbf{G}$ , in siemens, are

$$
G_{11} = \frac{1}{5} +\frac{1}{10} = 0.3,\qquad G_{22} = \frac{1}{5} +\frac{1}{8} +\frac{1}{1} = 1.325
$$

$$
G_{33} = \frac{1}{8} +\frac{1}{8} +\frac{1}{4} = 0.5,\qquad G_{44} = \frac{1}{8} +\frac{1}{2} +\frac{1}{1} = 1.625
$$

The off- diagonal terms are

$$
\begin{array}{c c}{{G_{12}=-\frac{1}{5}=-0.2,}}&{{G_{13}=G_{14}=0}}\\ {{}}&{{}}\\ {{G_{21}=-0.2,}}&{{G_{23}=-\frac{1}{8}=-0.125,}}\\ {{}}&{{}}\\ {{G_{31}=0,}}&{{G_{32}=-0.125,}}\\ {{}}&{{}}\\ {{G_{41}=0,}}&{{G_{42}=-1,}}\end{array}\qquad G_{43}=-0.125
$$

The input current vector  $\mathbf{i}$  has the following terms, in amperes:

$$
i_{1} = 3,\qquad i_{2} = -1 - 2 = -3,\qquad i_{3} = 0,\qquad i_{4} = 2 + 4 = 6
$$

Thus, the node- voltage equations are

$$
\left[ \begin{array}{cccc}0.3 & -0.2 & 0 & 0\\ -0.2 & 1.325 & -0.125 & -1\\ 0 & -0.125 & 0.5 & -0.125\\ 0 & -1 & -0.125 & 1.625 \end{array} \right]\left[ \begin{array}{c}\nu_{1}\\ \nu_{2}\\ \nu_{3}\\ \nu_{4} \end{array} \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{c}3\\ -3\\ 0\\ 6 \end{array} \right]
$$

which can be solved using MATLAB to obtain the node voltages  $\nu_{1}, \nu_{2}, \nu_{3}$ , and  $\nu_{4}$ .

By inspection, obtain the node- voltage equations for the circuit in Fig. 3.28.

# Answer:

$$
\left[ \begin{array}{cccc}1.25 & -0.2 & -1 & 0 \\ -0.2 & 0.2 & 0 & 0 \\ -1 & 0 & 1.25 & -0.25 \\ 0 & 0 & -0.25 & 1.25 \end{array} \right]\left[ \begin{array}{c}\nu_{1} \\ \nu_{2} \\ \nu_{3} \\ \nu_{4} \end{array} \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{c}0 \\ 5 \\ -3 \\ 2 \end{array} \right]

Figure 3.29 For Example 3.9.

# Solution:

We have five meshes, so the resistance matrix is 5 by 5. The diagonal terms, in ohms, are:

$$
\begin{array}{c c c}{{R_{11}=5+2+2=9,}}&{{R_{22}=2+4+1+1+2=10,}}\\ {{}}&{{}}\\ {{R_{33}=2+3+4=9,}}&{{R_{44}=1+3+4=8,}}&{{R_{55}=1+3=4}}\end{array}
$$

The off- diagonal terms are:

$$
\begin{array}{c c c}{{R_{12}=-2,}}&{{R_{13}=-2,}}&{{R_{14}=0=R_{15},}}\\ {{}}&{{}}&{{}}\\ {{R_{21}=-2,}}&{{R_{23}=-4,}}&{{R_{24}=-1,}}&{{R_{25}=-1,}}\\ {{}}&{{}}&{{}}\\ {{R_{31}=-2,}}&{{R_{32}=-4,}}&{{R_{34}=0=R_{35},}}\\ {{}}&{{}}&{{}}\\ {{R_{41}=0,}}&{{R_{42}=-1,}}&{{R_{43}=0,}}&{{R_{45}=-3,}}\\ {{}}&{{}}&{{}}\\ {{R_{51}=0,}}&{{R_{52}=-1,}}&{{R_{53}=0,}}&{{R_{54}=-3}}\end{array}
$$

The input voltage vector  $\mathbf{v}$  has the following terms in volts:

$$
\begin{array}{c c}{{\nu_{1}=4,}}&{{\nu_{2}=10-4=6,}}\\ {{}}&{{}}\\ {{\nu_{3}=-12+6=-6,}}&{{\nu_{4}=0,}}&{{\nu_{5}=-6}}\end{array}
$$

Thus, the mesh- current equations are:

$$
\left[ \begin{array}{r r r r r}{9} & {-2} & {-2} & 0 & 0\\ {-2} & {10} & {-4} & {-1} & {-1}\\ {-2} & {-4} & 9 & 0 & 0\\ 0 & {-1} & 0 & 8 & {-3}\\ 0 & {-1} & 0 & {-3} & 4 \end{array} \right]\left[ \begin{array}{r}{i_{1}}\\ {i_{2}}\\ {i_{3}}\\ {i_{4}}\\ {i_{5}} \end{array} \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{r}{4}\\ {6}\\ {-6}\\ {0}\\ {-6} \end{array} \right]
$$

From this, we can use MATLAB to obtain mesh currents  $i_{1}, i_{2}, i_{3}, i_{4}$ , and  $i_{5}$ .

# 3.7 Nodal Versus Mesh Analysis

Both nodal and mesh analyses provide a systematic way of analyzing a complex network. Someone may ask: Given a network to be analyzed, how do we know which method is better or more efficient? The choice of the better method is dictated by two factors.

The first factor is the nature of the particular network. Networks that contain many series- connected elements, voltage sources, or supermeshes are more suitable for mesh analysis, whereas networks with parallel- connected elements, current sources, or supernodes are more suitable for nodal analysis. Also, a circuit with fewer nodes than meshes is better analyzed using nodal analysis, while a circuit with fewer meshes than nodes is better analyzed using mesh analysis. The key is to select the method that results in the smaller number of equations.

The second factor is the information required. If node voltages are required, it may be expedient to apply nodal analysis. If branch or mesh currents are required, it may be better to use mesh analysis.

It is helpful to be familiar with both methods of analysis, for at least two reasons. First, one method can be used to check the results from the other method, if possible. Second, since each method has its limitations, only one method may be suitable for a particular problem. For example, mesh analysis is the only method to use in analyzing transistor circuits, as we shall see in Section 3.9. But mesh analysis cannot easily be used to solve an op amp circuit, as we shall see in Chapter 5, because there is no direct way to obtain the voltage across the op amp itself. For nonplanar networks, nodal analysis is the only option, because mesh analysis only applies to planar networks. Also, nodal analysis is more amenable to solution by computer, as it is easy to program. This allows one to analyze complicated circuits that defy hand calculation. A computer software package based on nodal analysis is introduced next.

# 3.8 Circuit Analysis with PSpice

PSpice is a computer software circuit analysis program that we will gradually learn to use throughout the course of this text. This section illustrates how to use PSpice for Windows to analyze the dc circuits we have studied so far.

The reader is expected to review the tutorial before proceeding in this section. It should be noted that PSpice is only helpful in determining branch voltages and currents when the numerical values of all the circuit components are known.

A tutorial on using PSpice for Windows can be found in Connect.

Use PSpice to find the node voltages in the circuit of Fig. 3.31.

# Solution:

The first step is to draw the given circuit using Schematics. If one follows the instructions given in the PSpice tutorial found in Connect, the schematic in Fig. 3.32 is produced. Because this is a dc analysis, we use voltage source VDC and current source IDC. The pseudocomponent VIEWPOINTS are added to display the required node voltages. Once the circuit is drawn and saved as exam310. sch, we run PSpice by selecting Analysis/Simulate. The circuit is simulated and the results are displayed

# 3.9 Applications: DC Transistor Circuits

Most of us deal with electronic products on a routine basis and have some experience with personal computers. A basic component for the integrated circuits found in these electronics and computers is the active, three- terminal device known as the transistor. Understanding the transistor is essential before an engineer can start an electronic circuit design.

Figure 3.37 depicts various kinds of transistors commercially available. There are two basic types of transistors: bipolar junction transistors (BJTs) and field- effect transistors (FETs). Here, we consider only the BJTs, which were the first of the two and are still used today. Our objective is to present enough detail about the BJT to enable us to apply the techniques developed in this chapter to analyze dc transistor circuits.

Hulton Archive/Archive Photos/ Stringer/Getty Images

William Schockley (1910- 1989), John Bardeen (1908- 1991), and Walter Brattain (1902- 1987) co- invented the transistor.

Nothing has had a greater impact on the transition from the "Industrial Age" to the "Age of the Engineer" than the transistor. I am sure that Dr. Shockley, Dr. Bardeen, and Dr. Brattain had no idea they would have this incredible effect on our history. While working at Bell Laboratories, they successfully demonstrated the point- contact transistor, invented by Bardeen and Brattain in 1947, and the junction transistor, which Shockley conceived in 1948 and successfully produced in 1951.

It is interesting to note that the idea of the field- effect transistor, the most commonly used one today, was first conceived in 1925- 1928 by J. E. Lilienfeld, a German immigrant to the United States. This is evident from his patents of what appears to be a field- effect transistor. Unfortunately, the technology to realize this device had to wait until 1954 when Shockley's field- effect transistor became a reality. Just think what today would be like if we had this transistor 30 years earlier!

For their contributions to the creation of the transistor, Dr. Shockley, Dr. Bardeen, and Dr. Brattain received, in 1956, the Nobel Prize in physics. It should be noted that Dr. Bardeen is the only individual to win two Nobel prizes in physics; the second came later for work in superconductivity at the University of Illinois.

Figure 3.37 Various types of transistors. Mark Dierker/McGraw-Hill Education

There are two types of BJTs: npn and pnp, with their circuit symbols as shown in Fig. 3.38. Each type has three terminals, designated as emitter (E), base (B), and collector (C). For the npn transistor, the currents and voltages of the transistor are specified as in Fig. 3.39. Applying KCL to Fig. 3.39(a) gives

$$
I_{E} = I_{B} + I_{C} \tag{3.27}
$$

where  $I_{E}, I_{C}$ , and  $I_{B}$  are emitter, collector, and base currents, respectively. Similarly, applying KVL to Fig. 3.39(b) gives

$$
V_{CE} + V_{EB} + V_{BC} = 0 \tag{3.28}
$$

where  $V_{CE}, V_{EB}$ , and  $V_{BC}$  are collector- emitter, emitter- base, and base- collector voltages. The BJT can operate in one of three modes: active, cutoff, and saturation. When transistors operate in the active mode, typically  $V_{BE} \simeq 0.7 \mathrm{~V}$ ,

$$
I_{C} = \alpha I_{E} \tag{3.29}
$$

where  $\alpha$  is called the common- base current gain. In Eq. (3.29),  $\alpha$  denotes the fraction of electrons injected by the emitter that are collected by the collector. Also,

$$
I_{C} = \beta I_{B} \tag{3.30}
$$

where  $\beta$  is known as the common- emitter current gain. The  $\alpha$  and  $\beta$  are characteristic properties of a given transistor and assume constant values for that transistor. Typically,  $\alpha$  takes values in the range of 0.98 to 0.999, while  $\beta$  takes values in the range of 50 to 1000. From Eqs. (3.27) to (3.30), it is evident that

$$
I_{E} = (1 + \beta)I_{B} \tag{3.31}
$$

and

$$
\beta = \frac{\alpha}{1 - \alpha} \tag{3.32}
$$

These equations show that, in the active mode, the BJT can be modeled as a dependent current- controlled current source. Thus, in circuit analysis, the dc equivalent model in Fig. 3.40(b) may be used to replace the npn transistor in Fig. 3.40(a). Since  $\beta$  in Eq. (3.32) is large, a small base current controls large currents in the output circuit. Consequently, the bipolar transistor can serve as an amplifier, producing both current gain and voltage gain. Such amplifiers can be used to furnish a considerable amount of power to transducers such as loudspeakers or control motors.

It should be observed in the following examples that one cannot directly analyze transistor circuits using nodal analysis because of the potential difference between the terminals of the transistor. Only when the transistor is replaced by its equivalent model can we apply nodal analysis.

Figure 3.41 For Example 3.12.

# Solution:

For the input loop, KVL gives

$$
-4 + I_{B}(20 \times 10^{3}) + V_{BE} = 0
$$

Since  $V_{BE} = 0.7 \mathrm{~V}$  in the active mode,

$$
I_{B} = \frac{4 - 0.7}{200 \times 10^{3}} = 16.5 \mu \mathrm{A}
$$

But

$$
I_{C} = \beta I_{B} = 50 \times 16.5 \mu \mathrm{A} = 0.825 \mathrm{~mA}
$$

For the output loop, KVL gives

$$
-\nu_{o} - 100 I_{C} + 6 = 0
$$

or

$$
\nu_{o} = 6 - 100 I_{C} = 6 - 0.0825 = 5.917 \mathrm{~V}
$$

Note that  $\nu_{o} = V_{CE}$  in this case.

2. Present. We are to determine the output voltage of the circuit shown in Fig. 3.43. The circuit contains an ideal transistor with  $\beta = 150$  and  $V_{BE} = 0.7 \mathrm{V}$ .

3. Alternative. We can use mesh analysis to solve for  $\nu_{o}$ . We can replace the transistor with its equivalent circuit and use nodal analysis. We can try both approaches and use them to check each other. As a third check, we can use the equivalent circuit and solve it using PSpice.

4. Attempt.

METHOD 1 Working with Fig. 3.44(a), we start with the first loop.

$$
-2 + 100\mathrm{k}I_{1} + 200\mathrm{k}(I_{1} - \mathrm{I}_{2}) = 0\qquad \mathrm{or}\qquad 3I_{1} - 2I_{2} = 2\times 10^{-5}
$$

Figure 3.44 Solution of the problem in Example 3.13: (a) Method 1, (b) Method 2, (c) Method 3.

Now for loop 2.

$$
200\mathrm{k}(I_{2} - I_{1}) + V_{B E} = 0\qquad \mathrm{or}\qquad -2I_{1} + 2I_{2} = -0.7\times 10^{-5} \tag{3.13.2}
$$

Since we have two equations and two unknowns, we can solve for  $I_{1}$  and  $I_{2}$ . Adding Eq. (3.13.1) to (3.13.2) we get;

$$
I_{1} = 1.3\times 10^{-5}\mathrm{A}\qquad \mathrm{and}\qquad I_{2} = (-0.7 + 2.6)10^{-5} / 2 = 9.5\mu \mathrm{A}
$$

Since  $I_{3} = - 150I_{2} = - 1.425\mathrm{mA}$ , we can now solve for  $\nu_{o}$  using loop 3:

$$
-\nu_{o} + 1\mathrm{k}I_{3} + 16 = 0\qquad \mathrm{or}\qquad \nu_{o} = -1.425 + 16 = \mathbf{14.575V}
$$

METHOD 2 Replacing the transistor with its equivalent circuit produces the circuit shown in Fig. 3.44(b). We can now use nodal analysis to solve for  $\nu_{o}$ .

At node number 1:  $V_{1} = 0.7\mathrm{V}$

$$
(0.7 - 2) / 100\mathrm{k} + 0.7 / 200\mathrm{k} + I_{B} = 0\qquad \mathrm{or}\qquad I_{B} = 9.5\mu \mathrm{A}
$$

At node number 2 we have:

$$
\begin{array}{r}{150I_{B} + (\nu_{o} - 16) / 1\mathrm{k} = 0\qquad \mathrm{or}}\\ {\nu_{o} = 16 - 150\times 10^{3}\times 9.5\times 10^{-6} = \mathbf{1}4.575\mathrm{V}} \end{array}
$$

5. Evaluate. The answers check, but to further check we can use PSpice (Method 3), which gives us the solution shown in Fig. 3.44(c).

6. Satisfactory? Clearly, we have obtained the desired answer with a very high confidence level. We can now present our work as a solution to the problem.

# 3.10 Summary

1. Nodal analysis is the application of Kirchhoff's current law at the nonreference nodes. (It is applicable to both planar and nonplanar circuits.) We express the result in terms of the node voltages. Solving the simultaneous equations yields the node voltages.

2. A supernode consists of two nonreference nodes connected by a (dependent or independent) voltage source.

3. Mesh analysis is the application of Kirchhoff's voltage law around meshes in a planar circuit. We express the result in terms of mesh currents. Solving the simultaneous equations yields the mesh currents.

4. A supermesh consists of two meshes that have a (dependent or independent) current source in common. 
5. Nodal analysis is normally used when a circuit has fewer node equations than mesh equations. Mesh analysis is normally used when a circuit has fewer mesh equations than node equations. 
6. Circuit analysis can be carried out using PSpice. 
7. DC transistor circuits can be analyzed using the techniques covered in this chapter.

# Circuit Theorems

Your success as an engineer will be directly proportional to your ability to communicate!

—Charles K. Alexander

# Enhancing Your Skills and Your Career

# Enhancing Your Communication Skills

Taking a course in circuit analysis is one step in preparing yourself for a career in electrical engineering. Enhancing your communication skills while in school should also be part of that preparation, as a large part of your time will be spent communicating.

People in industry have complained again and again that graduating engineers are ill- prepared in written and oral communication. An engineer who communicates effectively becomes a valuable asset.

You can probably speak or write easily and quickly. But how effectively do you communicate? The art of effective communication is of the utmost importance to your success as an engineer.

For engineers in industry, communication is key to promotability. Consider the result of a survey of U.S. corporations that asked what factors influence managerial promotion. The survey includes a listing of 22 personal qualities and their importance in advancement. You may be surprised to note that "technical skill based on experience" placed fourth from the bottom. Attributes such as self- confidence, ambition, flexibility, maturity, ability to make sound decisions, getting things done with and through people, and capacity for hard work all ranked higher. At the top of the list was "ability to communicate." The higher your professional career progresses, the more you will need to communicate. Therefore, you should regard effective communication as an important tool in your engineering tool chest.

Learning to communicate effectively is a lifelong task you should always work toward. The best time to begin is while still in school. Continually look for opportunities to develop and strengthen your reading, writing, listening, and speaking skills. You can do this through classroom presentations, team projects, active participation in student organizations, and enrollment in communication courses. The risks are less now than later in the workplace.

# Learning Objectives

By using the information and exercises in this chapter you will be able to:

1. Develop and enhance your skills in using nodal analysis and mesh analysis to analyze basic circuits. 
2. Understand how linearity works with basic circuits. 
3. Explain the principle of superposition and how it can be used to help analyze circuits. 
4. Understand the value of source transformation and how it can be used to simplify circuits. 
5. Recognize Thevenin's and Norton's theorems and know how they can lead to greatly simplified circuits. 
6. Explain the maximum power transfer concept.

# 4.1 Introduction

A major advantage of analyzing circuits using Kirchhoff's laws as we did in Chapter 3 is that we can analyze a circuit without tampering with its original configuration. A major disadvantage of this approach is that, for a large, complex circuit, tedious computation is involved.

The growth in areas of application of electric circuits has led to an evolution from simple to complex circuits. To handle the complexity, engineers over the years have developed some theorems to simplify circuit analysis. Such theorems include Thevenin's and Norton's theorems. Since these theorems are applicable to linear circuits, we first discuss the concept of circuit linearity. In addition to circuit theorems, we discuss the concepts of superposition, source transformation, and maximum power transfer in this chapter. The concepts we develop are applied in the last section to source modeling and resistance measurement.

# 4.2 Linearity Property

Linearity is the property of an element describing a linear relationship between cause and effect. Although the property applies to many circuit elements, we shall limit its applicability to resistors in this chapter. The property is a combination of both the homogeneity (scaling) property and the additivity property.

The homogeneity property requires that if the input (also called the excitation) is multiplied by a constant, then the output (also called the response) is multiplied by the same constant. For a resistor, for example, Ohm's law relates the input  $i$  to the output  $\nu$ ,

$$
\nu = iR \tag{4.1}
$$

If the current is increased by a constant  $k$ , then the voltage increases correspondingly by  $k$ ; that is,

$$
k i R = k\nu \tag{4.2}
$$

The additivity property requires that the response to a sum of inputs is the sum of the responses to each input applied separately. Using the voltage- current relationship of a resistor, if

$$
\nu_{1} = i_{1}R \tag{4.3a}
$$

and

$$
\nu_{2} = i_{2}R \tag{4.3b}
$$

then applying  $(i_{1} + i_{2})$  gives

$$
\nu = (i_{1} + i_{2})R = i_{1}R + i_{2}R = \nu_{1} + \nu_{2} \tag{4.4}
$$

We say that a resistor is a linear element because the voltage- current relationship satisfies both the homogeneity and the additivity properties.

In general, a circuit is linear if it is both additive and homogeneous. A linear circuit consists of only linear elements, linear dependent sources, and independent sources.

A linear circuit is one whose output is linearly related (or directly proportional) to its input.

Throughout this book we consider only linear circuits. Note that since  $p = i^{2}R = \nu^{2} / R$  (making it a quadratic function rather than a linear one), the relationship between power and voltage (or current) is nonlinear. Therefore, the theorems covered in this chapter are not applicable to power.

To illustrate the linearity principle, consider the linear circuit shown in Fig. 4.1. The linear circuit has no independent sources inside it. It is excited by a voltage source  $\nu_{s}$ , which serves as the input. The circuit is terminated by a load  $R$ . We may take the current  $i$  through  $R$  as the output. Suppose  $\nu_{s} = 10 \mathrm{V}$  gives  $i = 2 \mathrm{A}$ . According to the linearity principle,  $\nu_{s} = 1 \mathrm{V}$  will give  $i = 0.2 \mathrm{A}$ . By the same token,  $i = 1 \mathrm{mA}$  must be due to  $\nu_{s} = 5 \mathrm{mV}$ .

For example, when current  $i_{1}$  flows through resistor  $R$ , the power is  $p_{1} = R_{1}^{2}$ , and when current  $i_{2}$  flows through  $R$ , the power is  $p_{2} = R_{2}^{2}$ . If current  $i_{1} + i_{2}$  flows through  $R$ , the power absorbed is  $p_{3} = R(i_{1} + i_{2})^{2} = R_{1}^{2} + R_{2}^{2} + 2R_{1}i_{2} \neq p_{1} + p_{2}$ . Thus, the power relation is nonlinear.

For the circuit in Fig. 4.2, find  $I_{o}$  when  $\nu_{s} = 12 \mathrm{V}$  and  $\nu_{s} = 24 \mathrm{V}$ .

# Solution:

Applying KVL to the two loops, we obtain

$$
\begin{array}{c}{12i_1 - 4i_2 + \nu_s = 0}\\ {-4i_1 + 16i_2 - 3\nu_x - \nu_s = 0} \end{array} \tag{4.1.2}
$$

But  $\nu_{x} = 2i_{1}$ . Equation (4.1.2) becomes

$$
-10i_{1} + 16i_{2} - \nu_{s} = 0 \tag{4.1.3}
$$

Adding Eqs. (4.1.1) and (4.1.3) yields

$$
2i_{1} + 12i_{2} = 0 \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad i_{1} = -6i_{2}
$$

Substituting this in Eq. (4.1.1), we get

$$
-76i_{2} + \nu_{s} = 0 \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad i_{2} = \frac{\nu_{s}}{76}
$$

Figure 4.4 For Example 4.2.

# Solution:

If  $I_{o} = 1 \mathrm{~A}$ , then  $V_{1} = (3 + 5) I_{o} = 8 \mathrm{~V}$  and  $I_{1} = V_{1} / 4 = 2 \mathrm{~A}$ . Applying KCL at node 1 gives

$$
I_{2} = I_{1} + I_{o} = 3 \mathrm{~A}
$$

$$
V_{2} = V_{1} + 2 I_{2} = 8 + 6 = 14 \mathrm{~V}, \quad I_{3} = \frac{V_{2}}{7} = 2 \mathrm{~A}
$$

Applying KCL at node 2 gives

$$
I_{4} = I_{3} + I_{2} = 5 \mathrm{~A}
$$

Therefore,  $I_{s} = 5 \mathrm{~A}$ . This shows that assuming  $I_{o} = 1$  gives  $I_{s} = 5 \mathrm{~A}$ , the actual source current of  $15 \mathrm{~A}$  will give  $I_{o} = 3 \mathrm{~A}$  as the actual value.

Answer: 16 V.

# 4.3 Superposition

If a circuit has two or more independent sources, one way to determine the value of a specific variable (voltage or current) is to use nodal or mesh analysis as in Chapter 3. Another way is to determine the contribution of each independent source to the variable and then add them up. The latter approach is known as the superposition principle.

The idea of superposition rests on the linearity property.

The superposition principle states that the voltage across (or current through) an element in a linear circuit is the algebraic sum of the voltages across (or currents through) that element due to each independent source acting alone.

Superposition is not limited to circuit analysis but is applicable in many fields where cause and effect bear a linear relationship to one another.

The principle of superposition helps us to analyze a linear circuit with more than one independent source by calculating the contribution of each independent source separately. However, to apply the superposition principle, we must keep two things in mind:

1. We consider one independent source at a time while all other independent sources are turned off. This implies that we replace every voltage source by  $0\mathrm{V}$  (or a short circuit), and every current source by  $0\mathrm{A}$  (or an open circuit). This way we obtain a simpler and more manageable circuit. 
2. Dependent sources are left intact because they are controlled by circuit variables.

With these in mind, we apply the superposition principle in three steps:

# Steps to Apply Superposition Principle:

1. Turn off all independent sources except one source. Find the output (voltage or current) due to that active source using the techniques covered in Chapters 2 and 3. 
2. Repeat step 1 for each of the other independent sources. 
3. Find the total contribution by adding algebraically all the contributions due to the independent sources.

Analyzing a circuit using superposition has one major disadvantage: It may very likely involve more work. If the circuit has three independent sources, we may have to analyze three simpler circuits each providing the contribution due to the respective individual source. However, superposition does help reduce a complex circuit to simpler circuits through replacement of voltage sources by short circuits and of current sources by open circuits.

Keep in mind that superposition is based on linearity. For this reason, it is not applicable to the effect on power due to each source, because the power absorbed by a resistor depends on the square of the voltage or current. If the power value is needed, the current through (or voltage across) the element must be calculated first using superposition.

Other terms such as killed, made inactive, deaendered, or set equal to zero are often used to convey the same idea.

Figure 4.9 For Example 4.4.

Use the superposition theorem to find  $\nu$  in the circuit of Fig. 4.6.

# Solution:

Since there are two sources, let

$$
\nu = \nu_{1} + \nu_{2}
$$

where  $\nu_{1}$  and  $\nu_{2}$  are the contributions due to the 6- V voltage source and the 3- A current source, respectively. To obtain  $\nu_{1}$ , we set the current source to zero, as shown in Fig. 4.7(a). Applying KVL to the loop in Fig. 4.7(a) gives

$$
12i_{1} - 6 = 0 \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad i_{1} = 0.5 \mathrm{~A}
$$

Thus,

$$
\nu_{1} = 4i_{1} = 2 \mathrm{~V}
$$

We may also use voltage division to get  $\nu_{1}$  by writing

$$
\nu_{1} = \frac{4}{4 + 8} (6) = 2 \mathrm{~V}
$$

To get  $\nu_{2}$ , we set the voltage source to zero, as in Fig. 4.7(b). Using current division,

$$
i_{3} = \frac{8}{4 + 8} (3) = 2 \mathrm{~A}
$$

Hence,

$$
\nu_{2} = 4i_{3} = 8 \mathrm{~V}
$$

And we find

$$
\nu = \nu_{1} + \nu_{2} = 2 + 8 = 10 \mathrm{~V}
$$

Using the superposition theorem, find  $\nu_{o}$  in the circuit of Fig. 4.8.

Answer: 7.4 V.

Find  $i_{o}$  in the circuit of Fig. 4.9 using superposition.

# Solution:

The circuit in Fig. 4.9 involves a dependent source, which must be left intact. We let

$$
i_{o} = i_{o}^{\prime} + i_{o}^{\prime \prime} \tag{4.4.1}
$$

where  $i_{o}^{\prime}$  and  $i_{o}^{\prime \prime}$  are due to the 4- A current source and 20- V voltage source respectively. To obtain  $i_{o}^{\prime}$ , we turn off the 20- V source so that we have the circuit in Fig. 4.10(a). We apply mesh analysis in order to obtain  $i_{o}^{\prime}$ . For loop 1,

$$
i_{1} = 4 \mathrm{~A} \tag{4.4.2}
$$

For loop 2,

$$

But at node 0,

$$
i_{3} = i_{1} - i_{o}^{\prime} = 4 - i_{o}^{\prime} \tag{4.4.5}

Substituting Eqs. (4.4.2) and (4.4.5) into Eqs. (4.4.3) and (4.4.4) gives two simultaneous equations

$$
\begin{array}{c}3i_{2} - 2i_{o}^{\prime} = 8 \\ i_{2} + 5i_{o}^{\prime} = 20 \end{array} \tag{4.4.7}
$$

which can be solved to get

$$
i_{o}^{\prime} = \frac{52}{17}\mathrm{A} \tag{4.4.8}
$$

To obtain  $i_{o}^{\prime \prime}$ , we turn off the 4- A current source so that the circuit becomes that shown in Fig. 4.10(b). For loop 4, KVL gives

$$
6i_{4} - i_{5} - 5i_{o}^{\prime \prime} = 0 \tag{4.4.9}
$$

and for loop 5,

$$
-i_{4} + 10i_{5} - 20 + 5i_{o}^{\prime \prime} = 0 \tag{4.4.10}
$$

But  $i_{5} = - i_{o}^{\prime \prime}$ . Substituting this in Eqs. (4.4.9) and (4.4.10) gives

$$
\begin{array}{c}6i_{4} - 4i_{o}^{\prime \prime} = 0 \\ i_{4} + 5i_{o}^{\prime \prime} = -20 \end{array} \tag{4.4.12}
$$

which we solve to get

$$
i_{o}^{\prime \prime} = -\frac{60}{17}\mathrm{A} \tag{4.4.13}
$$

Now substituting Eqs. (4.4.8) and (4.4.13) into Eq. (4.4.1) gives

$$
i_{o} = -\frac{8}{17} = -0.4706\mathrm{A}
$$

Figure 4.12 For Example 4.5.

For the circuit in Fig. 4.12, use the superposition principle to find  $i$ .

# Solution:

In this case, we have three sources. Let

$$
i = i_{1} + i_{2} + i_{3}
$$

where  $i_{1}, i_{2}$ , and  $i_{3}$  are due to the 12- V, 24- V, and 3- A sources respectively. To get  $i_{1}$ , consider the circuit in Fig. 4.13(a). Combining  $4 \Omega$  (on the right- hand side) in series with  $8 \Omega$  gives  $12 \Omega$ . The  $12 \Omega$  in parallel with  $4 \Omega$  gives  $12 \times 4 / 16 = 3 \Omega$ . Thus,

$$
i_{1} = \frac{12}{6} = 2 \mathrm{~A}
$$

To get  $i_{2}$ , consider the circuit in Fig. 4.13(b). Applying mesh analysis gives

$$
\begin{array}{r l r l}{{16i_{a}-4i_{b}+24=0}}&{{}}&{\Rightarrow}&{{}}&{{4i_{a}-i_{b}=-6}}\\ {{}}&{{}}&{{}}&{{}}&{{}}\\ {{7i_{b}-4i_{a}=0}}&{{}}&{\Rightarrow}&{{}}&{{i_{a}=\frac{7}{4}i_{b}}}\end{array} \tag{4.5.2}
$$

Substituting Eq. (4.5.2) into Eq. (4.5.1) gives

$$
i_{2} = i_{b} = -1
$$

To get  $i_{3}$ , consider the circuit in Fig. 4.13(c). Using nodal analysis gives

$$
3 = \frac{\nu_{2}}{8} + \frac{\nu_{2} - \nu_{1}}{4} \quad \Rightarrow \quad 24 = 3 \nu_{2} - 2 \nu_{1} \tag{4.5.3}
$$

$$
\frac{\nu_{2} - \nu_{1}}{4} = \frac{\nu_{1}}{4} + \frac{\nu_{1}}{3} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \nu_{2} = \frac{10}{3} \nu_{1} \tag{4.5.4}
$$

Substituting Eq. (4.5.4) into Eq. (4.5.3) leads to  $\nu_{1} = 3$  and

$$
i_{3} = \frac{\nu_{1}}{3} = 1 \mathrm{~A}
$$

Thus,

$$
i = i_{1} + i_{2} + i_{3} = 2 - 1 + 1 = 2 \mathrm{~A}

# 4.4 Source Transformation

We have noticed that series- parallel combination and wye- delta transformation help simplify circuits. Source transformation is another tool for simplifying circuits. Basic to these tools is the concept of equivalence. We recall that an equivalent circuit is one whose  $\nu$ - i characteristics are identical with the original circuit.

In Section 3.6, we saw that node- voltage (or mesh- current) equations can be obtained by mere inspection of a circuit when the sources are all independent current (or all independent voltage) sources. It is therefore expedient in circuit analysis to be able to substitute a voltage source in series with a resistor for a current source in parallel with a

resistor, or vice versa, as shown in Fig. 4.15. Either substitution is known as a source transformation.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-13/c95faf42-d8e0-4f06-a665-945fc5e108f1/2c255fe98b2ed0138b8f8d1b9bc50d82d816985ca43becb43c664113cb8824b4.jpg)  
Figure 4.15 Transformation of independent sources.

A source transformation is the process of replacing a voltage source  $v_{s}$  in series with a resistor  $R$  by a current source  $i_{s}$  in parallel with a resistor  $R$ , or vice versa.

The two circuits in Fig. 4.15 are equivalent—provided they have the same voltage- current relation at terminals  $a$ -  $b$ . It is easy to show that they are indeed equivalent. If the sources are turned off, the equivalent resistance at terminals  $a$ -  $b$  in both circuits is  $R$ . Also, when terminals  $a$ -  $b$  are short- circuited, the short- circuit current flowing from  $a$  to  $b$  is  $i_{sc} = v_{s} / R$  in the circuit on the left- hand side and  $i_{sc} = i_{s}$  for the circuit on the right- hand side. Thus,  $v_{s} / R = i_{s}$  in order for the two circuits to be equivalent. Hence, source transformation requires that

$$
\nu_{s} = i_{s}R \qquad \text{or} \qquad i_{s} = \frac{\nu_{s}}{R} \tag{4.5}
$$

Source transformation also applies to dependent sources, provided we carefully handle the dependent variable. As shown in Fig. 4.16, a dependent voltage source in series with a resistor can be transformed to a dependent current source in parallel with the resistor or vice versa where we make sure that Eq. (4.5) is satisfied.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-13/c95faf42-d8e0-4f06-a665-945fc5e108f1/f256395e5fcc86ea4e70c45389ccb89d310c7b9b55652489b5f22fd20cd5538c.jpg)  
Figure 4.16 Transformation of dependent sources.

Like the wye- delta transformation we studied in Chapter 2, a source transformation does not affect the remaining part of the circuit. When applicable, source transformation is a powerful tool that allows circuit manipulations to ease circuit analysis. However, we should keep the following points in mind when dealing with source transformation.

1. Note from Fig. 4.15 (or Fig. 4.16) that the arrow of the current source is directed toward the positive terminal of the voltage source.

2. Note from Eq. (4.5) that source transformation is not possible when  $R = 0$ , which is the case with an ideal voltage source. However, for a practical, nonideal voltage source,  $R \neq 0$ . Similarly, an ideal current source with  $R = \infty$  cannot be replaced by a finite voltage source. More will be said on ideal and nonideal sources in Section 4.10.1.

Use source transformation to find  $\nu_{o}$  in the circuit of Fig. 4.17.

# Solution:

We first transform the current and voltage sources to obtain the circuit in Fig. 4.18(a). Combining the  $4 - \Omega$  and  $2 - \Omega$  resistors in series and transforming the 12- V voltage source gives us Fig. 4.18(b). We now combine the  $3 - \Omega$  and  $6 - \Omega$  resistors in parallel to get 2- Ω. We also combine the 2- A and 4- A current sources to get a 2- A source. Thus, by repeatedly applying source transformations, we obtain the circuit in Fig. 4.18(c).

Figure 4.18 For Example 4.6.

We use current division in Fig. 4.18(c) to get

$$
i = \frac{2}{2 + 8} (2) = 0.4\mathrm{A}
$$

and

$$
\nu_{o} = 8i = 8(0.4) = 3.2\mathrm{V}
$$

Alternatively, since the  $8 - \Omega$  and  $2 - \Omega$  resistors in Fig. 4.18(c) are in parallel, they have the same voltage  $\nu_{o}$  across them. Hence,

$$
\nu_{o} = (8\parallel 2)(2\mathrm{A}) = \frac{8\times2}{10} (2) = 3.2\mathrm{V}

Figure 4.20 For Example 4.7.

Find  $\nu_{x}$  in Fig. 4.20 using source transformation.

# Solution:

The circuit in Fig. 4.20 involves a voltage- controlled dependent current source. We transform this dependent current source as well as the 6- V independent voltage source as shown in Fig. 4.21(a). The 18- V voltage source is not transformed because it is not connected in series with any resistor. The two  $2 - \Omega$  resistors in parallel combine to give a  $1 - \Omega$  resistor, which is in parallel with the 3- A current source. The current source is transformed to a voltage source as shown in Fig. 4.21(b). Notice that the terminals for  $\nu_{x}$  are intact. Applying KVL around the loop in Fig. 4.21(b) gives

$$
-3 + 5i + \nu_{x} + 18 = 0 \tag{4.7.1}
$$

Figure 4.21 For Example 4.7: Applying source transformation to the circuit in Fig. 4.20.

Applying KVL to the loop containing only the 3- V voltage source, the  $1 - \Omega$  resistor, and  $\nu_{x}$  yields

$$
-3 + 1i + \nu_{x} = 0 \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad \nu_{x} = 3 - i \tag{4.7.2}
$$

Substituting this into Eq. (4.7.1), we obtain

$$
15 + 5i + 3 - i = 0 \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad i = -4.5\mathrm{~A}
$$

Alternatively, we may apply KVL to the loop containing  $\nu_{x}$ , the  $4 - \Omega$  resistor, the voltage- controlled dependent voltage source, and the 18- V voltage source in Fig. 4.21(b). We obtain

$$
-\nu_{x} + 4i + \nu_{x} + 18 = 0 \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad i = -4.5\mathrm{~A}
$$

Thus,  $\nu_{x} = 3 - i = 7.5\mathrm{~V}$ .

# 4.5 Thevenin's Theorem

It often occurs in practice that a particular element in a circuit is variable (usually called the load) while other elements are fixed. As a typical example, a household outlet terminal may be connected to different appliances constituting a variable load. Each time the variable element is changed, the entire circuit has to be analyzed all over again. To avoid this problem, Thevenin's theorem provides a technique by which the fixed part of the circuit is replaced by an equivalent circuit.

According to Thevenin's theorem, the linear circuit in Fig. 4.23(a) can be replaced by that in Fig. 4.23(b). (The load in Fig. 4.23 may be a single resistor or another circuit.) The circuit to the left of the terminals  $a - b$  in Fig. 4.23(b) is known as the Thevenin equivalent circuit; it was developed in 1883 by M. Leon Thevenin (1857- 1926), a French telegraph engineer.

Thevenin's theorem states that a linear two- terminal circuit can be replaced by an equivalent circuit consisting of a voltage source  $V_{\mathrm{Th}}$  in series with a resistor  $R_{\mathrm{Th}}$  where  $V_{\mathrm{Th}}$  is the open- circuit voltage at the terminals and  $R_{\mathrm{Th}}$  is the input or equivalent resistance at the terminals when the independent sources are turned off.

The proof of the theorem will be given later, in Section 4.7. Our major concern right now is how to find the Thevenin equivalent voltage  $V_{\mathrm{Th}}$  and resistance  $R_{\mathrm{Th}}$ . To do so, suppose the two circuits in Fig. 4.23 are equivalent. Two circuits are said to be equivalent if they have the same voltage- current relation at their terminals. Let us find out what will make the two circuits in Fig. 4.23 equivalent. If the terminals  $a - b$  are made open- circuited (by removing the load), no current flows, so that the open- circuit voltage across the terminals  $a - b$  in Fig. 4.23(a) must be equal to the voltage source  $V_{\mathrm{Th}}$  in Fig. 4.23(b), since the two circuits are equivalent. Thus,  $V_{\mathrm{Th}}$  is the open- circuit voltage across the terminals as shown in Fig. 4.24(a); that is,

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-13/c95faf42-d8e0-4f06-a665-945fc5e108f1/9dfc1a1e55c8be6ddd7988b95e6b712309f59dd98cfe3c16173f104460de13e4.jpg)

Figure 4.24 Finding  $V_{\mathrm{Th}}$  and  $R_{\mathrm{Th}}$ .

Again, with the load disconnected and terminals  $a - b$  opencircuited, we turn off all independent sources. The input resistance (or equivalent resistance) of the dead circuit at the terminals  $a - b$  in Fig. 4.23(a) must be equal to  $R_{\mathrm{Th}}$  in Fig. 4.23(b) because the two circuits are equivalent. Thus,  $R_{\mathrm{Th}}$  is the input resistance at the terminals when the independent sources are turned off, as shown in Fig. 4.24(b); that is,

$$
R_{\mathrm{Th}} = R_{\mathrm{in}} \tag{4.7}
$$

Later we will see that an alternative way of finding  $R_{\mathrm{Th}}$  is  $R_{\mathrm{Th}} = \nu_{\mathrm{oc}} / i_{\mathrm{sc}}$ .

Figure 4.27 For Example 4.8.

To apply this idea in finding the Thevenin resistance  $R_{\mathrm{Th}}$ , we need to consider two cases.

CASE 1 If the network has no dependent sources, we turn off all independent sources.  $R_{\mathrm{Th}}$  is the input resistance of the network looking between terminals  $a$  and  $b$ , as shown in Fig. 4.24(b).

CASE 2 If the network has dependent sources, we turn off all independent sources. As with superposition, dependent sources are not to be turned off because they are controlled by circuit variables. We apply a voltage source  $\nu_{o}$  at terminals  $a$  and  $b$  and determine the resulting current  $i_{o}$ . Then  $R_{\mathrm{Th}} = \nu_{o} / i_{o}$ , as shown in Fig. 4.25(a). Alternatively, we may insert a current source  $i_{o}$  at terminals  $a$ -  $b$  as shown in Fig. 4.25(b) and find the terminal voltage  $\nu_{o}$ . Again  $R_{\mathrm{Th}} = \nu_{o} / i_{o}$ . Either of the two approaches will give the same result. In either approach we may assume any value of  $\nu_{o}$  and  $i_{o}$ . For example, we may use  $\nu_{o} = 1 \mathrm{~V}$  or  $i_{o} = 1 \mathrm{~A}$ , or even use unspecified values of  $\nu_{o}$  or  $i_{o}$ .

It often occurs that  $R_{\mathrm{Th}}$  takes a negative value. In this case, the negative resistance  $(\nu = - iR)$  implies that the circuit is supplying power. This is possible in a circuit with dependent sources; Example 4.10 will illustrate this.

Thevenin's theorem is very important in circuit analysis. It helps simplify a circuit. A large circuit may be replaced by a single independent voltage source and a single resistor. This replacement technique is a powerful tool in circuit design.

As mentioned earlier, a linear circuit with a variable load can be replaced by the Thevenin equivalent, exclusive of the load. The equivalent network behaves the same way externally as the original circuit. Consider a linear circuit terminated by a load  $R_{L}$ , as shown in Fig. 4.26(a). The current  $I_{L}$  through the load and the voltage  $V_{L}$  across the load are easily determined once the Thevenin equivalent of the circuit at the load's terminals is obtained, as shown in Fig. 4.26(b). From Fig. 4.26(b), we obtain

$$
I_{L} = \frac{V_{\mathrm{Th}}}{R_{\mathrm{Th}} + R_{L}} \tag{4.8a}
$$

$$
V_{L} = R_{L}I_{L} = \frac{R_{L}}{R_{\mathrm{Th}} + R_{L}} V_{\mathrm{Th}} \tag{4.8b}
$$

Note from Fig. 4.26(b) that the Thevenin equivalent is a simple voltage divider, yielding  $V_{L}$  by mere inspection.

Find the Thevenin equivalent circuit of the circuit shown in Fig. 4.27, to the left of the terminals  $a$ -  $b$ . Then find the current through  $R_{L} = 6$ ,  $16$ , and  $36 \Omega$ .

# Solution:

We find  $R_{\mathrm{Th}}$  by turning off the 32- V voltage source (replacing it with a short circuit) and the 2- A current source (replacing it with an

open circuit). The circuit becomes what is shown in Fig. 4.28(a). Thus,

$$
R_{\mathrm{Th}} = 4\parallel 12 + 1 = \frac{4\times 12}{16} +1 = 4\Omega
$$

Figure 4.28

For Example 4.8: (a) finding  $R_{\mathrm{Th}}$ , (b) finding  $V_{\mathrm{Th}}$ .

To find  $V_{\mathrm{Th}}$ , consider the circuit in Fig. 4.28(b). Applying mesh analysis to the two loops, we obtain

$$
-32 + 4i_{1} + 12(i_{1} - i_{2}) = 0, \qquad i_{2} = -2 \mathrm{A}
$$

Solving for  $i_{1}$ , we get  $i_{1} = 0.5 \mathrm{A}$ . Thus,

$$
V_{\mathrm{Th}} = 12(i_{1} - i_{2}) = 12(0.5 + 2.0) = 30 \mathrm{V}
$$

Alternatively, it is even easier to use nodal analysis. We ignore the  $1 - \Omega$  resistor since no current flows through it. At the top node, KCL gives

$$
\frac{32 - V_{\mathrm{Th}}}{4} +2 = \frac{V_{\mathrm{Th}}}{12}
$$

or

96 - 3V_{\mathrm{Th}} + 24 = V_{\mathrm{Th}} \Rightarrow V_{\mathrm{Th}} = 30 \mathrm{V}
$$

as obtained before. We could also use source transformation to find  $V_{\mathrm{Th}}$ .

The Thevenin equivalent circuit is shown in Fig. 4.29. The current through  $R_{L}$  is

$$
I_{L} = \frac{V_{\mathrm{Th}}}{R_{\mathrm{Th}} + R_{L}} = \frac{30}{4 + R_{L}}
$$

When  $R_{L} = 6$

$$
I_{L} = \frac{30}{10} = 3 \mathrm{A}
$$

When  $R_{L} = 16$

$$
I_{L} = \frac{30}{20} = 1.5 \mathrm{A}
$$

When  $R_{L} = 36$

$$
I_{L} = \frac{30}{40} = 0.75 \mathrm{A}
$$

Find the Thevenin equivalent of the circuit in Fig. 4.31 at terminals  $a$ -  $b$ .

# Solution:

This circuit contains a dependent source, unlike the circuit in the previous example. To find  $R_{\mathrm{Th}}$  , we set the independent source equal to zero but leave the dependent source alone. Because of the presence of the dependent source, however, we excite the network with a voltage source  $\nu_{o}$  connected to the terminals as indicated in Fig. 4.32(a). We may set  $\nu_{o} = 1\mathrm{~V~}$  to ease calculation, since the circuit is linear. Our goal is to find the current  $i_{o}$  through the terminals, and then obtain  $R_{\mathrm{Th}} = 1 / i_{o}$  . (Alternatively, we may insert a 1- A current source, find the corresponding voltage  $\nu_{o}$  , and obtain  $R_{\mathrm{Th}} = \nu_{o} / 1$  -

Applying mesh analysis to loop 1 in the circuit of Fig. 4.32(a) results in

$$
-2\nu_{x} + 2(i_{1} - i_{2}) = 0 \qquad \text{or} \qquad \nu_{x} = i_{1} - i_{2}
$$

But  $- 4i_{2} = \nu_{x} = i_{1} - i_{2}$ ; hence,

$$
i_{1} = -3i_{2} \tag{4.9.1}
$$

For loops 2 and 3, applying KVL produces

$$
4i_{2} + 2(i_{2} - i_{1}) + 6(i_{2} - i_{3}) = 0 \tag{4.9.2}
$$

$$
6(i_{3} - i_{2}) + 2i_{3} + 1 = 0 \tag{4.9.3}
$$

Solving these equations gives

$$
i_{3} = -\frac{1}{6}\mathrm{A}
$$

But  $i_{o} = - i_{3} = 1 / 6$  A. Hence,

$$
R_{\mathrm{Th}} = \frac{1\mathrm{~V}}{i_{o}} = 6\Omega
$$

To get  $V_{\mathrm{Th}}$  , we find  $\nu_{o c}$  in the circuit of Fig. 4.32(b). Applying mesh analysis, we get

$$
i_{1} = 5 \tag{4.9.4}
$$

$$
-2\nu_{x} + 2(i_{3} - i_{2}) = 0\qquad \Rightarrow \qquad \nu_{x} = i_{3} - i_{2} \tag{4.9.5}
$$

$$
4(i_{2} - i_{1}) + 2(i_{2} - i_{3}) + 6i_{2} = 0 \tag{4.9.5}
$$

or

$$
12i_{2} - 4i_{1} - 2i_{3} = 0 \tag{4.9.6}
$$

But  $4(i_{1} - i_{2}) = \nu_{x}$  . Solving these equations leads to  $i_{2} = 10 / 3$  . Hence,

$$
V_{\mathrm{Th}} = \nu_{o c} = 6i_{2} = 20 \mathrm{V}
$$

The Thevenin equivalent is as shown in Fig. 4.33.

Figure 4.34 For Practice Prob. 4.9.

Determine the Thevenin equivalent of the circuit in Fig. 4.35(a) at terminals  $a - b$ .

# Solution:

1. Define. The problem is clearly defined; we are to determine the Thevenin equivalent of the circuit shown in Fig. 4.35(a).

2. Present. The circuit contains a  $2 - \Omega$  resistor in parallel with a  $4 - \Omega$  resistor. These are, in turn, in parallel with a dependent current source. It is important to note that there are no independent sources.

3. Alternative. The first thing to consider is that, since we have no independent sources in this circuit, we must excite the circuit externally. In addition, when you have no independent sources the value for  $V_{\mathrm{Th}}$  will be equal to zero so you will only have to find  $R_{\mathrm{Th}}$ .

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-13/c95faf42-d8e0-4f06-a665-945fc5e108f1/ab1fb9a51f593bf503c4883c2e046acf0fa59a599d6820a6612b9adc103ff150.jpg)  
Figure 4.35 For Example 4.10.

The simplest approach is to excite the circuit with either a 1- V voltage source or a 1- A current source. Because we will end up with an equivalent resistance (either positive or negative), I prefer to use the current source and nodal analysis which will yield a voltage at the output terminals equal to the resistance (with 1 A flowing in,  $\nu_{o}$  is equal to 1 times the equivalent resistance).

As an alternative, the circuit could also be excited by a 1- V voltage source and mesh analysis could be used to find the equivalent resistance.

4. Attempt. We start by writing the nodal equation at  $a$  in Fig. 4.35(b) assuming  $i_{o} = 1$  A.

$$
2i_{x} + (\nu_{o} - 0) / 4 + (\nu_{o} - 0) / 2 + (-1) = 0 \tag{4.10.1}
$$

Given that we have two unknowns and only one equation, we will need a constraint equation.

$$
i_{x} = (0 - \nu_{o}) / 2 = -\nu_{o} / 2 \tag{4.10.2}
$$

Substituting Eq. (4.10.2) into Eq. (4.10.1) yields

$$
\begin{array}{l}{{2(-\nu_{o}/2)+(\nu_{o}-0)/4+(\nu_{o}-0)/2+(-1)=0}}\\ {{=(-1+\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{2})\nu_{o}-1\qquad\mathrm{or}\qquad\nu_{o}=-4\Omega V}}\end{array}
$$

Since  $\nu_{o} = 1\times R_{\mathrm{Th}}$  then  $R_{\mathrm{Th}} = \nu_{o} / 1 = - 4\Omega$

The negative value of the resistance tells us that, according to the passive sign convention, the circuit in Fig. 4.35(a) is supplying power. Of course, the resistors in Fig. 4.35(a) cannot supply power (they absorb power); it is the dependent source that supplies the power. This is an example of how a dependent source and resistors could be used to simulate negative resistance.

5. Evaluate. First of all, we note that the answer has a negative value.

We know this is not possible in a passive circuit, but in this circuit we do have an active device (the dependent current source). Thus, the equivalent circuit is essentially an active circuit that can supply power.

Now we must evaluate the solution. The best way to do this is to perform a check, using a different approach, and see if we obtain the same solution. Let us try connecting a 9- Ω resistor in series with a 10- V voltage source across the output terminals of the original circuit and then the Thevenin equivalent. To make the circuit easier to solve, we can take and change the parallel current source and 4- Ω resistor to a series voltage source and 4- Ω resistor by using source transformation. This, with the new load, gives us the circuit shown in Fig. 4.35(c).

We can now write two mesh equations.

$$
\begin{array}{l}8i_{x} + 4i_{1} + 2(i_{1} - i_{2}) = 0\\ 2(i_{2} - i_{1}) + 9i_{2} + 10 = 0 \end{array}
$$

Note, we only have two equations but have three unknowns, so we need a constraint equation. We can use

$$
i_{x} = i_{2} - i_{1}
$$

This leads to a new equation for loop 1. Simplifying leads to

$$
(4 + 2 - 8)i_{1} + (-2 + 8)i_{2} = 0
$$

or

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{-2i_{1}+6i_{2}=0\qquad\mathrm{or}\qquad i_{1}=3i_{2}}}\\ {{-2i_{1}+11i_{2}=-10}}\end{array}
$$

Substituting the first equation into the second gives

$$
-6i_{2} + 11i_{2} = -10\qquad \mathrm{or}\qquad i_{2} = -10 / 5 = -2\mathbf{A}
$$

Using the Thevenin equivalent is quite easy since we have only one loop, as shown in Fig. 4.35(d).

$$
-4i + 9i + 10 = 0\qquad \mathrm{or}\qquad i = -10 / 5 = -2\mathbf{A}
$$

5. Satisfactory? Clearly we have found the value of the equivalent circuit as required by the problem statement. Checking does validate that solution (we compared the answer we obtained by using the equivalent circuit with one obtained by using the load with the original circuit). We can present all this as a solution to the problem.

Obtain the Thevenin equivalent of the circuit in Fig. 4.36.

Answer:  $V_{\mathrm{Th}} = 0 \mathrm{~V}, R_{\mathrm{Th}} = - 7.5 \Omega$ .

# 4.6 Norton's Theorem

In 1926, about 43 years after Thevenin published his theorem, E. L. Norton, an American engineer at Bell Telephone Laboratories, proposed a similar theorem.

Norton's theorem states that a linear two- terminal circuit can be replaced by an equivalent circuit consisting of a current source  $I_{N}$  in parallel with a resistor  $R_{N}$ , where  $I_{N}$  is the short- circuit current through the terminals and  $R_{N}$  is the input or equivalent resistance at the terminals when the independent sources are turned off.

Thus, the circuit in Fig. 4.37(a) can be replaced by the one in Fig. 4.37(b).

The proof of Norton's theorem will be given in the next section. For now, we are mainly concerned with how to get  $R_{N}$  and  $I_{N}$ . We find  $R_{N}$  in the same way we find  $R_{\mathrm{Th}}$ . In fact, from what we know about source transformation, the Thevenin and Norton resistances are equal; that is,

$$
R_{N} = R_{\mathrm{Th}} \tag{4.9}
$$

To find the Norton current  $I_{N}$ , we determine the short- circuit current flowing from terminal  $a$  to  $b$  in both circuits in Fig. 4.37. It is

Figure 4.38 Finding Norton current  $I_{N}$ .

evident that the short- circuit current in Fig. 4.37(b) is  $I_{N}$ . This must be the same short- circuit current from terminal  $a$  to  $b$  in Fig. 4.37(a), since the two circuits are equivalent. Thus,

$$
I_{N} = i_{sc} \tag{4.10}
$$

shown in Fig. 4.38. Dependent and independent sources are treated the same way as in Thevenin's theorem.

Observe the close relationship between Norton's and Thevenin's theorems:  $R_{N} = R_{\mathrm{Th}}$  as in Eq. (4.9), and

$$
I_{N} = \frac{V_{\mathrm{Th}}}{R_{\mathrm{Th}}} \tag{4.11}
$$

The Thevenin and Norton equivalent circuits are related by a source transformation.

This is essentially source transformation. For this reason, source transformation is often called Thevenin- Norton transformation.

Since  $V_{\mathrm{Th}}$ ,  $I_{N}$ , and  $R_{\mathrm{Th}}$  are related according to Eq. (4.11), to determine the Thevenin or Norton equivalent circuit requires that we find:

The open- circuit voltage  $\nu_{oc}$  across terminals  $a$  and  $b$

The short- circuit current  $i_{sc}$  at terminals  $a$  and  $b$

The equivalent or input resistance  $R_{\mathrm{in}}$  at terminals  $a$  and  $b$  when all independent sources are turned off.

We can calculate any two of the three using the method that takes the least effort and use them to get the third using Ohm's law. Example 4.11 will illustrate this. Also, since

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{V_{\mathrm{Th}}=v_{o c}}}\\ {{I_{N}=i_{s c}}}\\ {{R_{\mathrm{Th}}=\frac{\nu_{o c}}{i_{s c}}=R_{N}}}\end{array} \tag{4.12b}
$$

the open- circuit and short- circuit tests are sufficient to find any Thevenin or Norton equivalent, of a circuit which contains at least one independent source.

Figure 4.39 For Example 4.11.

Find the Norton equivalent circuit of the circuit in Fig. 4.39 at terminals  $a - b$

# Solution:

We find  $R_{N}$  in the same way we find  $R_{\mathrm{Th}}$  in the Thevenin equivalent circuit. Set the independent sources equal to zero. This leads to the circuit in Fig. 4.40(a), from which we find  $R_{N}$ . Thus,

$$
R_{N} = 5\parallel (8 + 4 + 8) = 5\parallel 20 = \frac{20\times5}{25} = 4\Omega
$$

To find  $I_{N}$ , we short- circuit terminals  $a$  and  $b$ , as shown in Fig. 4.40(b). We ignore the  $5 - \Omega$  resistor because it has been short- circuited. Applying mesh analysis, we obtain

$$
i_{1} = 2\mathrm{A},\qquad 20i_{2} - 4i_{1} - 12 = 0
$$

From these equations, we obtain

$$
i_{2} = 1\mathrm{A} = i_{s c} = I_{N}
$$

Figure 4.40 For Example 4.11; finding: (a)  $R_{N}$ , (b)  $I_{N} = i_{sc}$ , (c)  $V_{\mathrm{Th}} = \nu_{oc}$ .

Alternatively, we may determine  $I_{N}$  from  $V_{\mathrm{Th}} / R_{\mathrm{Th}}$ . We obtain  $V_{\mathrm{Th}}$  as the open- circuit voltage across terminals  $a$  and  $b$  in Fig. 4.40(c). Using mesh analysis, we obtain

$$
\begin{array}{c}i_3 = 2\mathrm{A} \\ 25i_4 - 4i_3 - 12 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad i_4 = 0.8\mathrm{A} \end{array}
$$

and

$$
\nu_{oc} = V_{\mathrm{Th}} = 5i_4 = 4\mathrm{V}
$$

Hence,

$$
I_{N} = \frac{V_{\mathrm{Th}}}{R_{\mathrm{Th}}} = \frac{4}{4} = 1\mathrm{A}
$$

as obtained previously. This also serves to confirm Eq. (4.12c) that  $R_{\mathrm{Th}} = \nu_{oc} / i_{sc} = 4 / 1 = 4\Omega$ . Thus, the Norton equivalent circuit is as shown in Fig. 4.41.

Figure 4.43 For Example 4.12.

Using Norton's theorem, find  $R_{N}$  and  $I_{N}$  of the circuit in Fig. 4.43 at terminals  $a - b$ .

# Solution:

To find  $R_{N}$ , we set the independent voltage source equal to zero and connect a voltage source of  $\nu_{o} = 1 \mathrm{~V}$  (or any unspecified voltage  $\nu_{o}$ ) to the terminals. We obtain the circuit in Fig. 4.44(a). We ignore the  $4 - \Omega$  resistor because it is short- circuited. Also due to the short circuit, the  $5 - \Omega$  resistor, the voltage source, and the dependent current source are all in parallel. Hence,  $i_{x} = 0$ . At node  $a$ ,  $i_{o} = \frac{1}{3} \frac{\mathrm{V}}{\Omega} = 0.2 \mathrm{~A}$ , and

$$
R_{N} = \frac{\nu_{o}}{i_{o}} = \frac{1}{0.2} = 5 \Omega
$$

To find  $I_{N}$ , we short- circuit terminals  $a$  and  $b$  and find the current  $i_{sc}$ , as indicated in Fig. 4.44(b). Note from this figure that the  $4 \Omega$  resistor, the  $10 - \mathrm{V}$  voltage source, the  $5 - \Omega$  resistor, and the dependent current source are all in parallel. Hence,

$$
i_{x} = \frac{10}{4} = 2.5 \mathrm{~A}
$$

At node  $a$ , KCL gives

$$
i_{sc} = \frac{10}{5} + 2 i_{x} = 2 + 2(2.5) = 7 \mathrm{~A}
$$

Thus,

$$
I_{N} = 7 \mathrm{~A}

# 4.7 Derivations of Thevenin's and Norton's Theorems

In this section, we will prove Thevenin's and Norton's theorems using the superposition principle.

Consider the linear circuit in Fig. 4.46(a). It is assumed that the circuit contains resistors and dependent and independent sources. We have access to the circuit via terminals  $a$  and  $b$  , through which current from an external source is applied. Our objective is to ensure that the voltage- current relation at terminals  $a$  and  $b$  is identical to that of the Thevenin equivalent in Fig. 4.46(b). For the sake of simplicity, suppose the linear circuit in Fig. 4.46(a) contains two independent voltage sources  $\nu_{s1}$  and  $\nu_{s2}$  and two independent current sources  $i_{s1}$  and  $i_{s2}$  We may obtain any circuit variable, such as the terminal voltage  $\nu$  , by applying superposition. That is, we consider the contribution due to each independent source including the external source  $i$  . By superposition, the terminal voltage  $\nu$  is

$$
\nu = A_{0}i + A_{1}\nu_{s1} + A_{2}\nu_{s2} + A_{3}i_{s1} + A_{4}i_{s2} \tag{4.13}
$$

where  $A_{0},A_{1},A_{2},A_{3}$  , and  $A_{4}$  are constants. Each term on the right- hand side of Eq. (4.13) is the contribution of the related independent source; that is,  $A_{0}i$  is the contribution to  $\nu$  due to the external current source  $i$ $A_{1}\nu_{s1}$  is the contribution due to the voltage source  $\nu_{s1}$  , and so on. We may collect terms for the internal independent sources together as  $B_{0}$  , so that Eq. (4.13) becomes

$$
\nu = A_{0}i + B_{0} \tag{4.14}
$$

where  $B_{0} = A_{1}\nu_{s1} + A_{2}\nu_{s2} + A_{3}i_{s1} + A_{4}i_{s2}$  . We now want to evaluate the values of constants  $A_{0}$  and  $B_{0}$  . When the terminals  $a$  and  $b$  are open- circuited,  $i = 0$  and  $\nu = B_{0}$  . Thus,  $B_{0}$  is the open- circuit voltage  $\nu_{o c}$  , which is the same as  $V_{\mathrm{Th}}$  , so

$$
B_{0} = V_{\mathrm{Th}} \tag{4.15}
$$

When all the internal sources are turned off,  $B_{0} = 0$  . The circuit can then be replaced by an equivalent resistance  $R_{\mathrm{eq}}$  , which is the same as  $R_{\mathrm{Th}}$  , and Eq. (4.14) becomes

$$
\nu = A_{0}i = R_{\mathrm{Th}}i\qquad \Rightarrow \qquad A_{0} = R_{\mathrm{Th}} \tag{4.16}
$$

Substituting the values of  $A_{0}$  and  $B_{0}$  in Eq. (4.14) gives

$$
\nu = B_{\mathrm{Th}}i + V_{\mathrm{Th}} \tag{4.17}
$$

which expresses the voltage- current relation at terminals  $a$  and  $b$  of the circuit in Fig. 4.46(b). Thus, the two circuits in Fig. 4.46(a) and 4.46(b) are equivalent.

When the same linear circuit is driven by a voltage source  $\nu$  as shown in Fig. 4.47(a), the current flowing into the circuit can be obtained by superposition as

$$
i = C_{0}\nu +D_{0} \tag{4.18}
$$

where  $C_{0}\nu$  is the contribution to  $i$  due to the external voltage source  $\nu$  and  $D_{0}$  contains the contributions to  $i$  due to all internal independent sources. When the terminals  $a - b$  are short- circuited,  $\nu = 0$  so that

$$

When all the internal independent sources are turned off,  $D_{0} = 0$  and the circuit can be replaced by an equivalent resistance  $R_{\mathrm{eq}}$  (or an equivalent conductance  $G_{\mathrm{eq}} = 1 / R_{\mathrm{eq}}$ ), which is the same as  $R_{\mathrm{Th}}$  or  $R_{N}$ . Thus, Eq. (4.19) becomes

$$
i = \frac{\nu}{R_{\mathrm{Th}}} -I_{N} \tag{4.20}
$$

This expresses the voltage- current relation at terminals  $a - b$  of the circuit in Fig. 4.47(b), confirming that the two circuits in Fig. 4.47(a) and 4.47(b) are equivalent.

# 4.8 Maximum Power Transfer

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-13/c95faf42-d8e0-4f06-a665-945fc5e108f1/cc72c6050989b67272a45b6843bb529ded70dec65cd743bf68640f5e6a072492.jpg)  
Figure 4.48 The circuit used for maximum power transfer.

In many practical situations, a circuit is designed to provide power to a load. There are applications in areas such as communications where it is desirable to maximize the power delivered to a load. We now address the problem of delivering the maximum power to a load when given a system with known internal losses. It should be noted that this will result in significant internal losses greater than or equal to the power delivered to the load.

The Thevenin equivalent is useful in finding the maximum power a linear circuit can deliver to a load. We assume that we can adjust the load resistance  $R_{L}$ . If the entire circuit is replaced by its Thevenin equivalent except for the load, as shown in Fig. 4.48, the power delivered to the load is

$$
p = i^{2}R_{L} = \left(\frac{V_{\mathrm{Th}}}{R_{\mathrm{Th}} + R_{L}}\right)^{2}R_{L} \tag{4.21}
$$

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-13/c95faf42-d8e0-4f06-a665-945fc5e108f1/a3168972af9eb32faa99d1991a64373b791cf2f76823708fd81117388e205f16.jpg)  
Figure 4.49 Power delivered to the load as a function of  $R_{L}$ .

For a given circuit,  $V_{\mathrm{Th}}$  and  $R_{\mathrm{Th}}$  are fixed. By varying the load resistance  $R_{L}$ , the power delivered to the load varies as sketched in Fig. 4.49. We notice from Fig. 4.49 that the power is small for small or large values of  $R_{L}$  but maximum for some value of  $R_{L}$  between 0 and  $\infty$ . We now want to show that this maximum power occurs when  $R_{L}$  is equal to  $R_{\mathrm{Th}}$ . This is known as the maximum power theorem.

Maximum power is transferred to the load when the load resistance equals the Thevenin resistance as seen from the load  $(R_{L} = R_{\mathrm{Th}})$ .

To prove the maximum power transfer theorem, we differentiate  $p$  in Eq. (4.21) with respect to  $R_{L}$  and set the result equal to zero. We obtain

$$
\begin{array}{r l r}{{\frac{d p}{d R_{L}}=V_{\mathrm{Th}}^{2}\left[\frac{\left(R_{\mathrm{Th}}+R_{L}\right)^{2}-2R_{L}(R_{\mathrm{Th}}+R_{L})}{\left(R_{\mathrm{Th}}+R_{L}\right)^{4}}\right]}}\\ &{}&{=V_{\mathrm{Th}}^{2}\left[\frac{\left(R_{\mathrm{Th}}+R_{L}-2R_{L}\right)}{\left(R_{\mathrm{Th}}+R_{L}\right)^{3}}\right]=0}\end{array}
$$

This implies that

$$
0 = (R_{\mathrm{Th}} + R_L - 2R_L) = (R_{\mathrm{Th}} - R_L) \tag{4.22}
$$

which yields

$$
R_{L} = R_{\mathrm{Th}} \tag{4.23}
$$

showing that the maximum power transfer takes place when the load resistance  $R_{L}$  equals the Thevenin resistance  $R_{\mathrm{Th}}$ . We can readily confirm that Eq. (4.23) gives the maximum power by showing that  $a^2 p / \mathrm{d}R_L^2 < 0$ .

The maximum power transferred is obtained by substituting Eq. (4.23) into Eq. (4.21), for

$$
p_{\mathrm{max}} = \frac{V_{\mathrm{Th}}^2}{4R_{\mathrm{Th}}} \tag{4.24}
$$

Equation (4.24) applies only when  $R_{L} = R_{\mathrm{Th}}$ . When  $R_{L} \neq R_{\mathrm{Th}}$ , we compute the power delivered to the load using Eq. (4.21).

Find the value of  $R_{L}$  for maximum power transfer in the circuit of Fig. 4.50. Find the maximum power.

# Solution:

We need to find the Thevenin resistance  $R_{\mathrm{Th}}$  and the Thevenin voltage  $V_{\mathrm{Th}}$  across the terminals  $a - b$ . To get  $R_{\mathrm{Th}}$ , we use the circuit in Fig. 4.51(a) and obtain

$$

Figure 4.51 For Example 4.13: (a) finding  $R_{\mathrm{Th}}$ , (b) finding  $V_{\mathrm{Th}}$ .

To get  $V_{\mathrm{Th}}$ , we consider the circuit in Fig. 4.51(b). Applying mesh analysis gives

$$
-12 + 18i_{1} - 12i_{2} = 0, \qquad i_{2} = -2 \mathrm{~A}
$$

Solving for  $i_{1}$ , we get  $i_{1} = - 2 / 3$ . Applying KVL around the outer loop to get  $V_{\mathrm{Th}}$  across terminals  $a - b$ , we obtain

$$
-12 + 6i_{1} + 3i_{2} + 2(0) + V_{\mathrm{Th}} = 0 \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad V_{\mathrm{Th}} = 22 \mathrm{~V}
$$

For maximum power transfer,

$$
R_{L} = R_{\mathrm{Th}} = 9 \Omega
$$

and the maximum power is

$$
p_{\mathrm{max}} = \frac{V_{\mathrm{Th}}^{2}}{4R_{L}} = \frac{22^{2}}{4 \times 9} = 13.44 \mathrm{~W}
$$

# 4.9 Verifying Circuit Theorems with PSpice

In this section, we learn how to use PSpice to verify the theorems covered in this chapter. Specifically, we will consider using DC Sweep analysis to find the Thevenin or Norton equivalent at any pair of nodes in a circuit and the maximum power transfer to a load. The reader is advised to read Section D.3 of Appendix D in preparation for this section.

To find the Thevenin equivalent of a circuit at a pair of open terminals using PSpice, we use the schematic editor to draw the circuit and insert an independent probing current source, say, Ip, at the terminals. The probing current source must have a part name ISRC. We then perform a DC Sweep on Ip, as discussed in Section D.3. Typically, we may let the current through Ip vary from 0 to 1 A in 0.1 A increments. After saving and simulating the circuit, we use Probe to display a plot of the voltage across Ip versus the current through Ip. The zero intercept of the plot gives us the Thevenin equivalent voltage, while the slope of the plot is equal to the Thevenin resistance.

To find the Norton equivalent involves similar steps except that we insert a probing independent voltage source (with a part name VSRC), say, Vp, at the terminals. We perform a DC Sweep on Vp and let Vp vary from 0 to 1 V in 0.1- V increments. A plot of the current through Vp versus the voltage across Vp is obtained using the Probe menu after simulation. The zero intercept is equal to the Norton current, while the slope of the plot is equal to the Norton conductance.

To find the maximum power transfer to a load using PSpice involves performing a DC parametric Sweep on the component value of  $R_{L}$  in Fig. 4.48 and plotting the power delivered to the load as a function of  $R_{L}$ . According to Fig. 4.49, the maximum power occurs

when  $R_{L} = R_{\mathrm{Th}}$ . This is best illustrated with an example, and Example 4.15 provides one.

We use VSRC and ISRC as part names for the independent voltage and current sources, respectively.

Consider the circuit in Fig. 4.31 (see Example 4.9). Use PSpice to find the Thevenin and Norton equivalent circuits.

# Solution:

(a) To find the Thevenin resistance  $R_{\mathrm{Th}}$  and Thevenin voltage  $V_{\mathrm{Th}}$  at the terminals  $a - b$  in the circuit in Fig. 4.31, we first use Schematics to draw the circuit as shown in Fig. 4.53(a). Notice that a probing current source I2 is inserted at the terminals. Under Analysis/Setup, we select DC Sweep. In the DC Sweep dialog box, we select Linear for the Sweep Type and Current Source for the Sweep Var. Type. We enter I2 under the Name box, 0 as Start Value, 1 as End Value, and 0.1 as Increment. After simulation, we add trace V(I2:-) from the PSpice A/D window and obtain the plot shown in Fig. 4.53(b). From the plot, we obtain

$$
V_{\mathrm{Th}} = \mathrm{Zero~intercept} = 20 \mathrm{V}, \qquad R_{\mathrm{Th}} = \mathrm{Slope} = \frac{26 - 20}{1} = 6 \Omega
$$

These agree with what we got analytically in Example 4.9.

(b) To find the Norton equivalent, we modify the schematic in Fig. 4.53(a) by replaying the probing current source with a probing voltage source V1. The result is the schematic in Fig. 4.54(a). Again, in the DC Sweep dialog box, we select Linear for the Sweep Type and Voltage Source for the Sweep Var. Type. We enter V1 under Name box, 0 as Start Value, 1 as End Value, and 0.1 as Increment. Under the PSpice A/D Window, we add trace I (V1) and obtain the plot in Fig. 4.54(b). From the plot, we obtain

$$
\begin{array}{c}I_{N} = \mathrm{Zero~intercept} = 3.335 \mathrm{A} \\ G_{N} = \mathrm{Slope} = \frac{3.335 - 3.165}{1} = 0.17 \mathrm{S} \end{array}

Figure 4.56 Schematic for the circuit in Fig. 4.55.

Refer to the circuit in Fig. 4.55. Use PSpice to find the maximum power transfer to  $R_{L}$ .

# Solution:

We need to perform a DC Sweep on  $R_{L}$  to determine when the power across it is maximum. We first draw the circuit using Schematics as shown in Fig. 4.56. Once the circuit is drawn, we take the following three steps to further prepare the circuit for a DC Sweep.

The first step involves defining the value of  $R_{L}$  as a parameter, since we want to vary it. To do this:

1. DCLICKL the value 1k of R2 (representing  $R_{L}$ ) to open up the Set Attribute Value dialog box.  
2. Replace 1k with  $\{\mathrm{RL}\}$  and click OK to accept the change.

Note that the curly brackets are necessary.

The second step is to define parameter. To achieve this:

1. Select Draw/Get New Part/Libraries .../special.slb.

2. Type PARAM in the PartName box and click OK.

3. DRAG the box to any position near the circuit.

4. CLICKL to end placement mode.

5. DCLICKL to open up the PartName: PARAM dialog box.

6. CLICKL on NAME1 = and enter RL (with no curly brackets) in the Value box, and CLICKL Save Attr to accept change.

7. CLICKL on VALUE1 = and enter 2k in the Value box, and CLICKL Save Attr to accept change.

8. Click OK.

The value  $2\mathrm{k}$  in item 7 is necessary for a bias point calculation; it cannot be left blank.

The third step is to set up the DC Sweep to sweep the parameter. To do this:

1. Select Analysis/Setput to bring up the DC Sweep dialog box.

2. For the Sweep Type, select Linear (or Octave for a wide range of  $R_{L}$ ).

3. For the Sweep Var. Type, select Global Parameter.

4. Under the Name box, enter RL.

5. In the Start Value box, enter 100.

6. In the End Value box, enter  $5\mathrm{k}$ .

7. In the Increment box, enter 100.

8. Click OK and Close to accept the parameters.

After taking these steps and saving the circuit, we are ready to simulate. Select Analysis/Simulate. If there are no errors, we select Add Trace in the PSpice A/D window and type  $- \mathrm{V}(\mathrm{R}2:2)^{*}\mathrm{I}(\mathrm{R}2)$  in the Trace Command box. [The negative sign is needed since I(R2) is negative.] This gives the plot of the power delivered to  $R_{L}$  as  $R_{L}$  varies from  $100\Omega$  to  $5\mathrm{k}\Omega$ . We can also obtain the power absorbed by  $R_{L}$  by typing  $\mathrm{V}(\mathrm{R}2:2)^{*}\mathrm{V}(\mathrm{R}2:2) / \mathrm{RL}$  in the Trace Command box. Either way, we obtain the plot in Fig. 4.57. It is evident from the plot that the maximum power is  $250\mu \mathrm{W}$ . Notice that the maximum occurs when  $R_{L} = 1\mathrm{k}\Omega$ , as expected analytically.

Answer:  $125\mu \mathrm{W}$ .

# 4.10 Applications

In this section we will discuss two important practical applications of the concepts covered in this chapter: source modeling and resistance measurement.

# 4.10.1 Source Modeling

Source modeling provides an example of the usefulness of the Thevenin or the Norton equivalent. An active source such as a battery is often characterized by its Thevenin or Norton equivalent circuit. An ideal voltage source provides a constant voltage irrespective of the current drawn by the load, while an ideal current source supplies a constant current regardless of the load voltage. As Fig. 4.58 shows, practical voltage and current sources are not ideal, due to their internal resistances or source resistances  $R_{s}$  and  $R_{p}$ . They become ideal as  $R_{s}\rightarrow 0$  and  $R_{p}\rightarrow \infty$ . To show that this is the case, consider the effect of the load on voltage

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-13/c95faf42-d8e0-4f06-a665-945fc5e108f1/92d2ac18d8cf0d05d289434caf680961d125e9f3d2d862e2ab8ead976468c5ab.jpg)  
Figure 4.58 (a) Practical voltage source, (b) practical current source.

sources, as shown in Fig. 4.59(a). By the voltage division principle, the load voltage is

$$
\nu_{L} = \frac{R_{L}}{R_{s} + R_{L}} \nu_{s} \tag{4.25}
$$

As  $R_{L}$  increases, the load voltage approaches a source voltage  $\nu_{s}$ , as illustrated in Fig. 4.59(b). From Eq. (4.25), we should note that:

1. The load voltage will be constant if the internal resistance  $R_{s}$  of the source is zero or, at least,  $R_{s} \ll R_{L}$ . In other words, the smaller  $R_{s}$  is compared with  $R_{L}$ , the closer the voltage source is to being ideal.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-13/c95faf42-d8e0-4f06-a665-945fc5e108f1/e29e59bc76131b8705bad1f3c3a199b63ea369ae8b16b563786747b90c309c35.jpg)  
Figure 4.59 (a) Practical voltage source connected to a load  $R_{L}$ , (b) load voltage decreases as  $R_{L}$  decreases.  
Figure 4.60 (a) Practical current source connected to a load  $R_{L}$ , (b) load current decreases as  $R_{L}$  increases.

2. When the load is disconnected (i.e., the source is open-circuited so that  $R_{L} \to \infty$ ),  $\nu_{oc} = \nu_{s}$ . Thus,  $\nu_{s}$  may be regarded as the unloaded source voltage. The connection of the load causes the terminal voltage to drop in magnitude; this is known as the loading effect.

The same argument can be made for a practical current source when connected to a load as shown in Fig. 4.60(a). By the current division principle,

$$
i_{L} = \frac{R_{p}}{R_{p} + R_{L}} i_{s} \tag{4.26}
$$

Figure 4.60(b) shows the variation in the load current as the load resistance increases. Again, we notice a drop in current due to the load (loading effect), and load current is constant (ideal current source) when the internal resistance is very large (i.e.,  $R_{p} \to \infty$  or, at least,  $R_{p} \gg R_{L}$ ).

Sometimes, we need to know the unloaded source voltage  $\nu_{s}$  and the internal resistance  $R_{s}$  of a voltage source. To find  $\nu_{s}$  and  $R_{s}$ , we follow the procedure illustrated in Fig. 4.61. First, we measure the open- circuit voltage  $\nu_{oc}$  as in Fig. 4.61(a) and set

$$
\nu_{s} = \nu_{oc} \tag{4.27}
$$

Then, we connect a variable load  $R_{L}$  across the terminals as in Fig. 4.61(b). We adjust the resistance  $R_{L}$  until we measure a load voltage of exactly one- half of the open- circuit voltage,  $\nu_{L} = \nu_{oc} / 2$ , because now  $R_{L} = R_{\mathrm{Th}} = R_{s}$ . At that point, we disconnect  $R_{L}$  and measure it. We set

$$
R_{s} = R_{L} \tag{4.28}
$$

For example, a car battery may have  $\nu_{s} = 12 \mathrm{~V}$  and  $R_{s} = 0.05 \Omega$ .

Figure 4.61(a) Measuring  $\nu_{oc}$ , (b) measuring  $\nu_{L}$ .

The terminal voltage of a voltage source is  $12 \mathrm{V}$  when connected to a 2- W load. When the load is disconnected, the terminal voltage rises to  $12.4 \mathrm{V}$ . (a) Calculate the source voltage  $\nu_{s}$  and internal resistance  $R_{s}$ . (b) Determine the voltage when an  $8 - \Omega$  load is connected to the source.

# Solution:

(a) We replace the source by its Thevenin equivalent. The terminal voltage when the load is disconnected is the open-circuit voltage,

$$
\nu_{s} = \nu_{oc} = 12.4 \mathrm{V}
$$

When the load is connected, as shown in Fig. 4.62(a),  $\nu_{L} = 12 \mathrm{V}$  and  $p_{L} = 2 \mathrm{W}$ . Hence,

$$
p_{L} = \frac{\nu_{L}^{2}}{R_{L}} \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad R_{L} = \frac{\nu_{L}^{2}}{p_{L}} = \frac{12^{2}}{2} = 72 \Omega
$$

The load current is

$$
i_{L} = \frac{\nu_{L}}{R_{L}} = \frac{12}{72} = \frac{1}{6} \mathrm{A}
$$

The voltage across  $R_{s}$  is the difference between the source voltage  $\nu_{s}$  and the load voltage  $\nu_{L}$ , or

$$
12.4 - 12 = 0.4 = R_{s} i_{L}, \qquad R_{s} = \frac{0.4}{I_{L}} = 2.4 \Omega
$$

(b) Now that we have the Thevenin equivalent of the source, we connect the  $8 - \Omega$  load across the Thevenin equivalent as shown in Fig. 4.62(b). Using voltage division, we obtain

Practice Problem 4.16

# 4.10.2 Resistance Measurement

Although the ohmmeter method provides the simplest way to measure resistance, more accurate measurement may be obtained using the Wheatstone bridge. While ohmmeters are designed to measure resistance in low, mid, or high range, a Wheatstone bridge is used to measure resistance in the mid range, say, between  $1\Omega$  and  $1\mathrm{M}\Omega$  . Very low values of resistances are measured with a milliohmmeter, while very high values are measured with a Megger tester.

Historical note: The bridge was invented by Charles Wheatstone (1802- 1875), a British professor who also invented the telegraph, as Samuel Morse did independently in the United States.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-13/c95faf42-d8e0-4f06-a665-945fc5e108f1/7530acef48555183896801055c6e0884d9afc70475a37584604f73ee84f7b215.jpg)  
Figure 4.63 The Wheatstone bridge;  $R_{2}$  is the resistance to be measured.

The Wheatstone bridge (or resistance bridge) circuit is used in a number of applications. Here we will use it to measure an unknown resistance. The unknown resistance  $R_{x}$  is connected to the bridge as shown in Fig. 4.63. The variable resistance is adjusted until no current flows through the galvanometer, which is essentially a d'Arsonval movement operating as a sensitive current- indicating device like an ammeter in the microamp range. Under this condition  $\nu_{1} = \nu_{2}$ , and the bridge is said to be balanced. Since no current flows through the galvanometer,  $R_{1}$  and  $R_{2}$  behave as though they were in series; so do  $R_{3}$  and  $R_{x}$ . The fact that no current flows through the galvanometer also implies that  $\nu_{1} = \nu_{2}$ . Applying the voltage division principle,

$$
\nu_{1} = \frac{R_{2}}{R_{1} + R_{2}} \nu = \nu_{2} = \frac{R_{x}}{R_{3} + R_{x}} \nu \tag{4.29}
$$

Hence, no current flows through the galvanometer when

$$
\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1} + R_{2}} = \frac{R_{x}}{R_{3} + R_{x}} \Rightarrow R_{2} R_{3} = R_{1} R_{x}
$$

or

$$
R_{x} = \frac{R_{3}}{R_{1}} R_{2} \tag{4.30}
$$

If  $R_{1} = R_{3}$ , and  $R_{2}$  is adjusted until no current flows through the galvanometer, then  $R_{x} = R_{2}$ .

How do we find the current through the galvanometer when the Wheatstone bridge is unbalanced? We find the Thevenin equivalent ( $V_{\mathrm{Th}}$  and  $R_{\mathrm{Th}}$ ) with respect to the galvanometer terminals. If  $R_{m}$  is the resistance of the galvanometer, the current through it under the unbalanced condition is

$$
I = \frac{V_{\mathrm{Th}}}{R_{\mathrm{Th}} + R_{m}} \tag{4.31}
$$

Example 4.18 will illustrate this.

# Example 4.17

In Fig. 4.63,  $R_{1} = 500 \Omega$  and  $R_{3} = 200 \Omega$ . The bridge is balanced when  $R_{2}$  is adjusted to be  $125 \Omega$ . Determine the unknown resistance  $R_{x}$ .

# Solution:

Using Eq. (4.30) gives

$$
R_{x} = \frac{R_{3}}{R_{1}} R_{2} = \frac{200}{500} 125 = 50 \Omega
$$

A Wheatstone bridge has  $R_{1} = R_{3} = 1 \mathrm{k}\Omega$ .  $R_{2}$  is adjusted until no current flows through the galvanometer. At that point,  $R_{2} = 3.2 \mathrm{k}\Omega$ . What is the value of the unknown resistance?Answer:  $3.2 \mathrm{k}\Omega$ .

Answer:  $3.2\mathrm{k}\Omega$

The circuit in Fig. 4.64 represents an unbalanced bridge. If the galvanometer has a resistance of  $40\Omega$  , find the current through the galvanometer.

Figure 4.64 Unbalanced bridge of Example 4.18.

# Solution:

We first need to replace the circuit by its Thevenin equivalent at terminals  $a$  and  $b$  . The Thevenin resistance is found using the circuit in Fig.  $4.65(a)$  . Notice that the  $3 - \mathrm{k}\Omega$  and  $1 - \mathrm{K}\Omega$  resistors are in parallel; so are the 400 and  $600 - \Omega$  resistors. The two parallel combinations form a series combination with respect to terminals  $a$  and  $b$  . Hence,

$$
\begin{array}{l}{R_{\mathrm{Th}} = 3000\parallel 1000 + 400\parallel 600}\\ {= \frac{3000\times 1000}{3000 + 1000} +\frac{400\times 600}{400 + 600} = 750 + 240 = 990\Omega} \end{array}
$$

To find the Thevenin voltage, we consider the circuit in Fig. 4.65(b). Using the voltage division principle gives

$$
\nu_{1} = \frac{1000}{1000 + 3000} (220) = 55 \mathrm{~V}, \qquad \nu_{2} = \frac{600}{600 + 400} (220) = 132 \mathrm{~V}
$$

Applying KVL around loop ab gives

$$
-\nu_{1} + V_{\mathrm{Th}} + \nu_{2} = 0\qquad \mathrm{or}\qquad V_{\mathrm{Th}} = \nu_{1} - \nu_{2} = 55 - 132 = -77 \mathrm{V}
$$

Having determined the Thevenin equivalent, we find the current through the galvanometer using Fig. 4.65(c).

$$
I_{G} = \frac{V_{\mathrm{Th}}}{R_{\mathrm{Th}} + R_{m}} = \frac{-77}{990 + 40} = -74.76 \mathrm{mA}
$$

The negative sign indicates that the current flows in the direction opposite to the one assumed, that is, from terminal  $b$  to terminal  $a$

# 4.11 Summary

1. A linear network consists of linear elements, linear dependent sources, and linear independent sources.

2. Network theorems are used to reduce a complex circuit to a simpler one, thereby making circuit analysis much simpler.

3. The superposition principle states that for a circuit having multiple independent sources, the voltage across (or current through) an element is equal to the algebraic sum of all the individual voltages (or currents) due to each independent source acting one at a time.

4. Source transformation is a procedure for transforming a voltage source in series with a resistor to a current source in parallel with a resistor, or vice versa.

5. Thevenin's and Norton's theorems allow us to isolate a portion of a network while the remaining portion of the network is replaced by an equivalent network. The Thevenin equivalent consists of a voltage source  $V_{\mathrm{Th}}$  in series with a resistor  $R_{\mathrm{Th}}$ , while the Norton equivalent consists of a current source  $I_{N}$  in parallel with a resistor  $R_{N}$ . The two theorems are related by source transformation.

$$
R_{N} = R_{\mathrm{Th}}, \qquad I_{N} = \frac{V_{\mathrm{Th}}}{R_{\mathrm{Th}}}
$$

6. For a given Thevenin equivalent circuit, maximum power transfer occurs when  $R_{L} = R_{\mathrm{Th}}$ ; that is, when the load resistance is equal to the Thevenin resistance.  
7. The maximum power transfer theorem states that the maximum power is delivered by a source to the load  $R_{L}$  when  $R_{L}$  is equal to  $R_{\mathrm{Th}}$ , the Thevenin resistance at the terminals of the load.  
8. PSpice can be used to verify the circuit theorems covered in this chapter.  
9. Source modeling and resistance measurement using the Wheatstone bridge provide applications for Thevenin's theorem.

# Career in Electronic Instrumentation

Engineering involves applying physical principles to design devices for the benefit of humanity. But physical principles cannot be understood without measurement. In fact, physicists often say that physics is the science that measures reality. Just as measurements are a tool for understanding the physical world, instruments are tools for measurement. The operational amplifier introduced in this chapter is a building block of modern electronic instrumentation. Therefore, mastery of operational amplifier fundamentals is paramount to any practical application of electronic circuits.

Electronic instruments are used in all fields of science and engineering. They have proliferated in science and technology to the extent that it would be ridiculous to have a scientific or technical education without exposure to electronic instruments. For example, physicists, physiologists, chemists, and biologists must learn to use electronic instruments. For electrical engineering students in particular, the skill in operating digital and analog electronic instruments is crucial. Such instruments include ammeters, voltmeters, ohmmeters, oscilloscopes, spectrum analyzers, and signal generators.

Beyond developing the skill for operating the instruments, some electrical engineers specialize in designing and constructing electronic instruments. These engineers derive pleasure in building their own instruments. Most of them invent and patent their inventions. Specialists in electronic instruments find employment in medical schools, hospitals, research laboratories, aircraft industries, and thousands of other industries where electronic instruments are routinely used.

Learning ObjectivesBy using the information and exercises in this chapter you will be able to:1. Comprehend how real operational amplifiers (op amps) function.2. Understand that ideal op amps function nearly identically to real ones and that they can be used to model them effectively in a variety of circuit applications.3. Realize how the basic inverting op amp is the workhorse of the op amp family.4. Use the inverting op amp to create summers.5. Use the op amp to create a difference amplifier.6. Explain how to cascade a variety of op amp circuits.

The term operational amplifier was introduced in 1947 by John Ragazzini and his colleagues, in their work on analog computers for the National Defense Research Council after World War II. The first op amps used vacuum tubes rather than transistors.

An op amp may also be regarded as a voltage amplifier with very high gain.

# 5.1 Introduction

Having learned the basic laws and theorems for circuit analysis, we are now ready to study an active circuit element of paramount importance: the operational amplifier, or op amp for short. The op amp is a versatile circuit building block.

The op amp is an electronic unit that behaves like a voltage- controlled voltage source.

It can also be used in making a voltage- or current- controlled current source. An op amp can sum signals, amplify a signal, integrate it, or differentiate it. The ability of the op amp to perform these mathematical operations is the reason it is called an operational amplifier. It is also the reason for the widespread use of op amps in analog design. Op amps are popular in practical circuit designs because they are versatile, inexpensive, easy to use, and fun to work with.

We begin by discussing the ideal op amp and later consider the nonideal op amp. Using nodal analysis as a tool, we consider ideal op amp circuits such as the inverter, voltage follower, summer, and difference amplifier. We will also analyze op amp circuits with PSpice. Finally, we learn how an op amp is used in digital- to- analog converters and instrumentation amplifiers.

# 5.2 Operational Amplifiers

An operational amplifier is designed so that it performs some mathematical operations when external components, such as resistors and capacitors, are connected to its terminals. Thus,

An op amp is an active circuit element designed to perform mathematical operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, differentiation, and integration.

The op amp is an electronic device consisting of a complex arrangement of resistors, transistors, capacitors, and diodes. A full discussion of what is inside the op amp is beyond the scope of this book. It will suffice

to treat the op amp as a circuit building block and simply study what takes place at its terminals.

Op amps are commercially available in integrated circuit packages in several forms. Figure 5.1 shows a typical op amp package. A typical one is the eight- pin dual in- line package (or DIP), shown in Fig. 5.2(a). Pin or terminal 8 is unused, and terminals 1 and 5 are of little concern to us. The five important terminals are:

1. The inverting input, pin 2.  
2. The noninverting input, pin 3.  
3. The output, pin 6.  
4. The positive power supply  $V^{+}$ , pin 7.  
5. The negative power supply  $V^{-}$ , pin 4.

The circuit symbol for the op amp is the triangle in Fig. 5.2(b); as shown, the op amp has two inputs and one output. The inputs are marked with minus  $(- )$  and plus  $(+)$  to specify inverting and noninverting inputs, respectively. An input applied to the noninverting terminal will appear with the same polarity at the output, while an input applied to the inverting terminal will appear inverted at the output.

As an active element, the op amp must be powered by a voltage supply as typically shown in Fig. 5.3. Although the power supplies are often ignored in op amp circuit diagrams for the sake of simplicity, the power supply currents must not be overlooked. By KCL,

$$
i_{o} = i_{1} + i_{2} + i_{+} + i_{-} \tag{5.1}
$$

The equivalent circuit model of an op amp is shown in Fig. 5.4. The output section consists of a voltage- controlled source in series with the

The op amp senses the difference between the two inputs, multiplies it by the gain  $A$ , and causes the resulting voltage to appear at the output. Thus, the output  $\nu_{o}$  is given by

$$
\nu_{o} = A\nu_{d} = A(\nu_{2} - \nu_{1}) \tag{5.3}
$$

Sometimes, voltage gain is expressed in decibels (dB), as discussed in Chapter 14.

$$
A\mathrm{dB} = 20\log_{10}A
$$

$A$  is called the open- loop voltage gain because it is the gain of the op amp without any external feedback from output to input. Table 5.1 shows typical values of voltage gain  $A$ , input resistance  $R_{i}$ , output resistance  $R_{o}$ , and supply voltage  $V_{CC}$ .

The concept of feedback is crucial to our understanding of op amp circuits. A negative feedback is achieved when the output is fed back to the inverting terminal of the op amp. As Example 5.1 shows, when there is a feedback path from output to input, the ratio of the output voltage to the input voltage is called the closed- loop gain. As a result of the negative feedback, it can be shown that the closed- loop gain is almost insensitive to the open- loop gain  $A$  of the op amp. For this reason, op amps are used in circuits with feedback paths.

A practical limitation of the op amp is that the magnitude of its output voltage cannot exceed  $|V_{CC}|$ . In other words, the output voltage is dependent on and is limited by the power supply voltage. Figure 5.5 illustrates that the op amp can operate in three modes, depending on the differential input voltage  $\nu_{d}$ :

1. Positive saturation,  $\nu_{o} = V_{CC}$ .  
2. Linear region,  $-V_{CC} \leq \nu_{o} = A\nu_{d} \leq V_{CC}$ .  
3. Negative saturation,  $\nu_{o} = -V_{CC}$ .

Figure 5.5 Op amp output voltage  $\nu_{o}$  as a function of the differential input voltage  $\nu_{d}$ .

If we attempt to increase  $\nu_{d}$  beyond the linear range, the op amp becomes saturated and yields  $\nu_{o} = V_{CC}$  or  $\nu_{o} = - V_{CC}$ . Throughout this book, we will assume that our op amps operate in the linear mode. This means that the output voltage is restricted by

$$
-V_{CC} \leq \nu_{o} \leq V_{CC} \tag{5.4}
$$

Although we shall always operate the op amp in the linear region, the possibility of saturation must be borne in mind when one designs with op amps, to avoid designing op amp circuits that will not work in the laboratory.

Throughout this book, we assume that an op amp operates in the linear range. Keep in mind the voltage constraint on the op amp in this mode.

A 741 op amp has an open- loop voltage gain of  $2 \times 10^{5}$ , input resistance of  $2 \mathrm{M}\Omega$ , and output resistance of  $50 \Omega$ . The op amp is used in the circuit of Fig. 5.6(a). Find the closed- loop gain  $\nu_{o} / \nu_{s}$ . Determine current  $i$  when  $\nu_{s} = 2 \mathrm{~V}$ .

# Solution:

Using the op amp model in Fig. 5.4, we obtain the equivalent circuit of Fig. 5.6(a) as shown in Fig. 5.6(b). We now solve the circuit in Fig. 5.6(b) by using nodal analysis. At node 1, KCL gives

$$
\frac{\nu_{s} - \nu_{1}}{10 \times 10^{3}} = \frac{\nu_{1}}{2000 \times 10^{3}} + \frac{\nu_{1} - \nu_{o}}{20 \times 10^{3}} \frac{\nu_{s} - \nu_{1}}{10 \mathrm{~K}} - \frac{\nu_{1} - 0}{2 \mathrm{~M}} - \frac{\nu_{1} - \nu_{o}}{20 \mathrm{~K}} = 0
$$

Multiplying through by  $2000 \times 10^{3}$ , we obtain

$$
200\nu_{s} = 301\nu_{1} - 100\nu_{o}
$$

or

$$
2\nu_{s} \simeq 3\nu_{1} - \nu_{o} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \nu_{1} = \frac{2\nu_{s} + \nu_{o}}{3} \tag{5.1.1}
$$

At node  $O$

$$
\frac{\nu_{1} - \nu_{o}}{20 \times 10^{3}} = \frac{\nu_{o} - A\nu_{d}}{50} \frac{\nu_{1} - \nu_{o}}{20 \mathrm{~K}} - \frac{\nu_{o} - A\nu_{d}}{50} = 0
$$

But  $\nu_{d} = - \nu_{1}$  and  $A = 200,000$ . Then

$$
\nu_{1} - \nu_{o} = 400(\nu_{o} + 200,000\nu_{1}) \tag{5.1.2}
$$

Substituting  $\nu_{1}$  from Eq. (5.1.1) into Eq. (5.1.2) gives

$$
0 \simeq 26,667,067\nu_{o} + 53,333,333\nu_{s} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{\nu_{o}}{\nu_{s}} = -1.9999699
$$

This is closed- loop gain, because the  $20 - \mathrm{k}\Omega$  feedback resistor closes the loop between the output and input terminals. When  $\nu_{s} = 2 \mathrm{~V}$ ,  $\nu_{o} = - 3.9999398 \mathrm{~V}$ . From Eq. (5.1.1), we obtain  $\nu_{1} = 20.066667 \mu \mathrm{V}$ . Thus,

$$
i = \frac{\nu_{1} - \nu_{o}}{20 \times 10^{3}} = 0.19999 \mathrm{~mA}
$$

It is evident that working with a nonideal op amp is tedious, as we are dealing with very large numbers.

# 5.3 Ideal Op Amp

To facilitate the understanding of op amp circuits, we will assume ideal op amps. An op amp is ideal if it has the following characteristics:

1. Infinite open-loop gain,  $A\simeq \infty$  
2. Infinite input resistance,  $R_{i}\simeq \infty$  
3. Zero output resistance,  $R_{o}\simeq 0$

An ideal op amp is an amplifier with infinite open- loop gain, infinite input resistance, and zero output resistance.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-13/c95faf42-d8e0-4f06-a665-945fc5e108f1/93f1a6013563cfd3462420e9f4cf62c8a79001a5680d4650fcb2bd71b5e01400.jpg)  
Figure 5.8 Ideal op amp model.

Although assuming an ideal op amp provides only an approximate analysis, most modern amplifiers have such large gains and input impedances that the approximate analysis is a good one. Unless stated otherwise, we will assume from now on that every op amp is ideal.

For circuit analysis, the ideal op amp is illustrated in Fig. 5.8, which is derived from the nonideal model in Fig. 5.4. Two important properties of the ideal op amp are:

1. The currents into both input terminals are zero:

$$
i_{1} = 0,\quad i_{2} = 0 \tag{5.5}
$$

This is due to infinite input resistance. An infinite resistance between the input terminals implies that an open circuit exists there and current cannot enter the op amp. But the output current is not necessarily zero according to Eq. (5.1).

2. The voltage across the input terminals is equal to zero; i.e.,

$$
\nu_{d} = \nu_{2} - \nu_{1} = 0 \tag{5.6}
$$

or

$$
\nu_{1} = \nu_{2} \tag{5.7}
$$

The two characteristics can be exploited by noting that for voltage calculations the input port behaves as a short circuit, while for current calculations the input port behaves as an open circuit.

Thus, an ideal op amp has zero current into its two input terminals and the voltage between the two input terminals is equal to zero. Equations (5.5) and (5.7) are extremely important and should be regarded as the key handles to analyzing op amp circuits.

Rework Practice Prob. 5.1 using the ideal op amp model.

# Solution:

We may replace the op amp in Fig. 5.7 by its equivalent model in Fig. 5.9 as we did in Example 5.1. But we do not really need to do this. We just need to keep Eqs. (5.5) and (5.7) in mind as we analyze the circuit in Fig. 5.7. Thus, the Fig. 5.7 circuit is presented as in Fig. 5.9. Notice that

$$
\nu_{2} = \nu_{s} \tag{5.2.1}
$$

Since  $i_{1} = 0$ , the 40- and 5- kΩ resistors are in series; the same current flows through them.  $\nu_{1}$  is the voltage across the 5- kΩ resistor. Hence, using the voltage division principle,

$$
\nu_{1} = \frac{5}{5 + 40}\nu_{o} = \frac{\nu_{o}}{9} \tag{5.2.2}
$$

According to Eq. (5.7),

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-13/c95faf42-d8e0-4f06-a665-945fc5e108f1/09ce2e63fdbde634369503de5ea1be72eb961aed5e83c9c24e4574e55ce2843c.jpg)  
Figure 5.9 For Example 5.2.

$$
\nu_{2} = \nu_{1} \tag{5.2.3}
$$

Substituting Eqs. (5.2.1) and (5.2.2) into Eq. (5.2.3) yields the closed- loop gain,

$$
\nu_{s} = \frac{\nu_{o}}{9}\Rightarrow \frac{\nu_{o}}{\nu_{s}} = 9 \tag{5.2.4}
$$

which is very close to the value of 9.00041 obtained with the nonideal model in Practice Prob. 5.1. This shows that negligibly small error results from assuming ideal op amp characteristics.

At node  $O$

$$
i_{o} = \frac{\nu_{o}}{40 + 5} +\frac{\nu_{o}}{20}\mathrm{mA} \tag{5.2.5}
$$

From Eq. (5.2.4), when  $\nu_{s} = 1\mathrm{V}$ ,  $\nu_{o} = 9\mathrm{V}$ . Substituting for  $\nu_{o} = 9\mathrm{V}$  in Eq. (5.2.5) produces

$$
i_{o} = 0.2 + 0.45 = 0.65\mathrm{mA}
$$

This, again, is close to the value of  $0.657\mathrm{mA}$  obtained in Practice Prob. 5.1 with the nonideal model.

Repeat Example 5.1 using the ideal op amp model.

Answer:  $- 2,200\mu \mathrm{A}$

# 5.4 Inverting Amplifier

In this and the following sections, we consider some useful op amp circuits that often serve as modules for designing more complex circuits. The first of such op amp circuits is the inverting amplifier shown in Fig. 5.10. In this circuit, the noninverting input is grounded,  $\nu_{i}$  is connected to the inverting input through  $R_{1}$ , and the feedback resistor  $R_{f}$  is connected between the inverting input and output. Our goal is to obtain

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-13/c95faf42-d8e0-4f06-a665-945fc5e108f1/4c26bc233e5cf5f29db497fb9f065220eb9ad2a929ec62a5b5eb21f980d7b0ce.jpg)  
Figure 5.10 The inverting amplifier.

the relationship between the input voltage  $\nu_{\mathrm{i}}$  and the output voltage  $\nu_{o}$ . Applying KCL at node 1,

$$
i_{1} = i_{2} \Rightarrow \frac{\nu_{i} - \nu_{1}}{R_{1}} = \frac{\nu_{I} - \nu_{o}}{R_{f}} \tag{5.8}
$$

A key feature of the inverting amplifier is that both the input signal and the feedback are applied at the inverting terminal of the op amp.

But  $\nu_{1} = \nu_{2} = 0$  for an ideal op amp, since the noninverting terminal is grounded. Hence,

$$
\frac{\nu_{i}}{R_{1}} = -\frac{\nu_{o}}{R_{f}}
$$

Note there are two types of gains: The one here is the closed- loop voltage gain  $A_{\nu}$ , while the op amp itself has an open- loop voltage gain  $A$ .

$$
\nu_{o} = -\frac{R_{f}}{R_{1}} \nu_{i} \tag{5.9}
$$

The voltage gain is  $A_{\nu} = \nu_{o} / \nu_{i} = - R_{f} / R_{1}$ . The designation of the circuit in Fig. 5.10 as an inverter arises from the negative sign. Thus,

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-13/c95faf42-d8e0-4f06-a665-945fc5e108f1/8f5fce214d05bbd341643facced62b33a00c5f44b246f9be70f155c8a0e8c424.jpg)  
Figure 5.11 An equivalent circuit for the inverter in Fig. 5.10.

An inverting amplifier reverses the polarity of the input signal while amplifying it.

Notice that the gain is the feedback resistance divided by the input resistance which means that the gain depends only on the external elements connected to the op amp. In view of Eq. (5.9), an equivalent circuit for the inverting amplifier is shown in Fig. 5.11. The inverting amplifier is used, for example, in a current- to- voltage converter.

# Example 5.3

Refer to the op amp in Fig. 5.12. If  $\nu_{i} = 0.5 \mathrm{~V}$ , calculate: (a) the output voltage  $\nu_{o}$ , and (b) the current in the  $10 - \mathrm{k}\Omega$  resistor.

Figure 5.12 For Example 5.3.

# Solution:

(a) Using Eq. (5.9),

$$
\frac{\nu_{o}}{\nu_{i}} = -\frac{R_{f}}{R_{1}} = -\frac{25}{10} = -2.5
$$

$$
\nu_{o} = -2.5\nu_{i} = -2.5(0.5) = -1.25\mathrm{~V}
$$

(b) The current through the  $10 - \mathrm{k}\Omega$  resistor is

$$
i = \frac{\nu_{i} - 0}{R_{1}} = \frac{0.5 - 0}{10 \times 10^{3}} = 50 \mu \mathrm{A}
$$

Find the output of the op amp circuit shown in Fig. 5.13. Calculate the current through the feedback resistor.

Answer:  $- 3.15 \mathrm{~V}$ ,  $11.25 \mu \mathrm{A}$ .

Determine  $\nu_{o}$  in the op amp circuit shown in Fig. 5.14.

# Solution:

Applying KCL at node  $a$ ,

$$
\frac{\nu_{a} - \nu_{o}}{40 \mathrm{k}\Omega} = \frac{6 - \nu_{a}}{20 \mathrm{k}\Omega}
$$

$$
\nu_{a} - \nu_{o} = 12 - 2\nu_{a} \Rightarrow \nu_{o} = 3\nu_{a} - 12
$$

But  $\nu_{a} = \nu_{b} = 2 \mathrm{~V}$  for an ideal op amp, because of the zero voltage drop across the input terminals of the op amp. Hence,

$$
\nu_{o} = 6 - 12 = -6 \mathrm{~V}
$$

Notice that if  $\nu_{b} = 0 = \nu_{a}$ , then  $\nu_{o} = - 12$ , as expected from Eq. (5.9).

Figure 5.16 The noninverting amplifier.

# 5.5 Noninverting Amplifier

Another important application of the op amp is the noninverting amplifier shown in Fig. 5.16. In this case, the input voltage  $\nu_{i}$  is applied directly at the noninverting input terminal, and resistor  $R_{1}$  is connected

between the ground and the inverting terminal. We are interested in the output voltage and the voltage gain. Application of KCL at the inverting terminal gives

$$
i_{1} = i_{2} \Rightarrow \frac{0 - \nu_{1}}{R_{1}} = \frac{\nu_{1} - \nu_{o}}{R_{f}} \tag{5.10}
$$

But  $\nu_{1} = \nu_{2} = \nu_{i}$ . Equation (5.10) becomes

$$
\frac{-\nu_{i}}{R_{1}} = \frac{\nu_{i} - \nu_{o}}{R_{f}}
$$

or

$$
\nu_{o} = \left(1 + \frac{R_{f}}{R_{1}}\right)\nu_{i} \tag{5.11}
$$

The voltage gain is  $A_{\nu} = \nu_{o} / \nu_{i} = 1 + R_{f} / R_{1}$ , which does not have a negative sign. Thus, the output has the same polarity as the input.

A noninverting amplifier is an op amp circuit designed to provide a positive voltage gain.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-13/c95faf42-d8e0-4f06-a665-945fc5e108f1/30868af81ff6575c165461e1372c09ea1d312e40e7fd639a96b058df390efb1f.jpg)  
Figure 5.17 The voltage follower.

Again we notice that the gain depends only on the external resistors.

Notice that if feedback resistor  $R_{f} = 0$  (short circuit) or  $R_{1} = \infty$  (open circuit) or both, the gain becomes 1. Under these conditions  $(R_{f} = 0$  and  $R_{1} = \infty)$ , the circuit in Fig. 5.16 becomes that shown in Fig. 5.17, which is called a voltage follower (or unity gain amplifier) because the output follows the input. Thus, for a voltage follower

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-13/c95faf42-d8e0-4f06-a665-945fc5e108f1/d9e249ef62ecfbe77dc3b0aeaa1ba2a7b1a0c2905ecdfe24cfb07e7d0dfdc495.jpg)  
Figure 5.18 A voltage follower used to isolate two cascaded stages of a circuit.

$$
\nu_{o} = \nu_{i} \tag{5.12}
$$

Such a circuit has a very high input impedance and is therefore useful as an intermediate- stage (or buffer) amplifier to isolate one circuit from another, as portrayed in Fig. 5.18. The voltage follower minimizes interaction between the two stages and eliminates interstage loading.

For the op amp circuit in Fig. 5.19, calculate the output voltage  $\nu_{o}$ .

# Solution:

We may solve this in two ways: using superposition and using nodal analysis.

■ METHOD 1 Using superposition, we let

$$
\nu_{o} = \nu_{o1} + \nu_{o2}
$$

where  $\nu_{o1}$  is due to the 6- V voltage source, and  $\nu_{o2}$  is due to the 4- V input. To get  $\nu_{o1}$ , we set the 4- V source equal to zero. Under this condition, the circuit becomes an inverter. Hence Eq. (5.9) gives

$$
\nu_{o1} = -\frac{10}{4} (6) = -15 \mathrm{~V}
$$

To get  $\nu_{o2}$ , we set the 6- V source equal to zero. The circuit becomes a noninverting amplifier so that Eq. (5.11) applies.

$$
\nu_{o2} = \left(1 + \frac{10}{4}\right) 4 = 14 \mathrm{~V}
$$

Thus,

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-13/c95faf42-d8e0-4f06-a665-945fc5e108f1/175b7fc0130b8954782b33ecfe0351e6cbc3b33eae9b12bd0197844156c37d75.jpg)  
Figure 5.19 For Example 5.5.

$$
\nu_{o} = \nu_{o1} + \nu_{o2} = -15 + 14 = -1 \mathrm{~V}
$$

METHOD 2 Applying KCL at node  $a$

$$
\frac{6 - \nu_{a}}{4} = \frac{\nu_{a} - \nu_{o}}{10}
$$

But  $\nu_{a} = \nu_{b} = 4$ , and so

$$
\frac{6 - 4}{4} = \frac{4 - \nu_{o}}{10} \Rightarrow 5 = 4 - \nu_{o}
$$

or  $\nu_{o} = - 1 \mathrm{~V}$ , as before.

Calculate  $\nu_{o}$  in the circuit of Fig. 5.20.

Answer: 7 V.

# 5.6 Summing Amplifier

Besides amplification, the op amp can perform addition and subtraction. The addition is performed by the summing amplifier covered in this section; the subtraction is performed by the difference amplifier covered in the next section.

A summing amplifier is an op amp circuit that combines several inputs and produces an output that is the weighted sum of the inputs.

The summing amplifier, shown in Fig. 5.21, is a variation of the inverting amplifier. It takes advantage of the fact that the inverting configuration can handle many inputs at the same time. We keep in

mind that the current entering each op amp input is zero. Applying KCL at node  $a$  gives

$$
i = i_{1} + i_{2} + i_{3} \tag{5.13}
$$

But

$$
\begin{array}{l l}{{i_{1}=\frac{\nu_{1}-\nu_{a}}{R_{1}},}}&{{i_{2}=\frac{\nu_{2}-\nu_{a}}{R_{2}}}}\\ {{i_{3}=\frac{\nu_{3}-\nu_{a}}{R_{3}},}}&{{i=\frac{\nu_{a}-\nu_{o}}{R_{f}}}}\end{array} \tag{5.14}
$$

We note that  $\nu_{a} = 0$  and substitute Eq. (5.14) into Eq. (5.13). We get

$$

$$

indicating that the output voltage is a weighted sum of the inputs. For this reason, the circuit in Fig. 5.21 is called a summer. Needless to say, the summer can have more than three inputs.

Calculate  $\nu_{o}$  and  $i_{o}$  in the op amp circuit in Fig. 5.22.

Figure 5.22 For Example 5.6.

# Solution:

This is a summer with two inputs. Using Eq. (5.15) gives

$$
\nu_{o} = -\left[\frac{10}{5} (2) + \frac{10}{2.5} (1)\right] = -(4 + 4) = -8 \mathrm{~V}
$$

The current  $i_{o}$  is the sum of the currents through the 10- and  $2 - \mathrm{k}\Omega$  resistors. Both of these resistors have voltage  $\nu_{o} = - 8 \mathrm{~V}$  across them, since  $\nu_{a} = \nu_{b} = 0$ . Hence,

$$
i_{o} = \frac{\nu_{o} - 0}{10} +\frac{\nu_{o} - 0}{2} \mathrm{~mA} = -0.8 - 4 = -4.8 \mathrm{~mA}
$$

# 5.7 Difference Amplifier

Difference (or differential) amplifiers are used in various applications where there is a need to amplify the difference between two input signals. They are first cousins of the instrumentation amplifier, the most useful and popular amplifier, which we will discuss in Section 5.10.

A difference amplifier is a device that amplifies the difference between two inputs but rejects any signals common to the two inputs.

Consider the op amp circuit shown in Fig. 5.24. Keep in mind that zero currents enter the op amp terminals. Applying KCL to node  $a$

$$
\frac{\nu_{1} - \nu_{a}}{R_{1}} = \frac{\nu_{a} - \nu_{o}}{R_{2}}
$$

or

$$
\nu_{o} = \left(\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}} +1\right)\nu_{a} - \frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}}\nu_{1} \tag{5.16}
$$

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-13/c95faf42-d8e0-4f06-a665-945fc5e108f1/3a704958f1d3b43c6a8809855a0b66fafeff88a6a89a758c621f8fa8a87b6a98.jpg)  
Figure 5.24 Difference amplifier.

The difference amplifier is also known as the subtractor, for reasons to be shown later.

Applying KCL to node  $b$ ,

$$
\frac{\nu_{2} - \nu_{b}}{R_{3}} = \frac{\nu_{b} - 0}{R_{4}}
$$

or

$$
\nu_{b} = \frac{R_{4}}{R_{3} + R_{4}} \nu_{2} \tag{5.17}
$$

But  $\nu_{a} = \nu_{b}$ . Substituting Eq. (5.17) into Eq. (5.16) yields

$$
\nu_{o} = \left(\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}} +1\right) \frac{R_{4}}{R_{3} + R_{4}} \nu_{2} - \frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}} \nu_{1}
$$

or

$$
\nu_{o} = \frac{R_{2}(1 + R_{1} / R_{2})}{R_{1}(1 + R_{3} / R_{4})} \nu_{2} - \frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}} \nu_{1} \tag{5.18}
$$

Since a difference amplifier must reject a signal common to the two inputs, the amplifier must have the property that  $\nu_{o} = 0$  when  $\nu_{1} = \nu_{2}$ . This property exists when

$$
\frac{R_{1}}{R_{2}} = \frac{R_{3}}{R_{4}} \tag{5.19}
$$

Thus, when the op amp circuit is a difference amplifier, Eq. (5.18) becomes

$$
\nu_{o} = \frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}} (\nu_{2} - \nu_{1}) \tag{5.20}
$$

If  $R_{2} = R_{1}$  and  $R_{3} = R_{4}$ , the difference amplifier becomes a subtractor, with the output

$$
\nu_{o} = \nu_{2} - \nu_{1} \tag{5.21}
$$

# Example 5.7

Design an op amp circuit with inputs  $\nu_{1}$  and  $\nu_{2}$  such that  $\nu_{o} = - 5 \nu_{1} + 3 \nu_{2}$ .

# Solution:

The circuit requires that

$$
\nu_{o} = 3 \nu_{2} - 5 \nu_{1} \tag{5.7.1}
$$

This circuit can be realized in two ways.

Design 1 If we desire to use only one op amp, we can use the op amp circuit of Fig. 5.24. Comparing Eq. (5.7.1) with Eq. (5.18), we see

$$
\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}} = 5 \Rightarrow R_{2} = 5 R_{1} \tag{5.7.2}
$$

Also,

$$
5\frac{(1 + R_{1} / R_{2})}{(1 + R_{3} / R_{4})} = 3 \Rightarrow \frac{\frac{6}{5}}{1 + R_{3} / R_{4}} = \frac{3}{5}
$$

or

$$
2 = 1 + \frac{R_{3}}{R_{4}} \Rightarrow R_{3} = R_{4} \tag{5.7.3}
$$

If we choose  $R_{1} = 10 \mathrm{k}\Omega$  and  $R_{3} = 20 \mathrm{k}\Omega$ , then  $R_{2} = 50 \mathrm{k}\Omega$  and  $R_{4} = 20 \mathrm{k}\Omega$ .

Design 2 If we desire to use more than one op amp, we may cascade an inverting amplifier and a two- input inverting summer, as shown in Fig. 5.25. For the summer,

$$
\nu_{o} = -\nu_{a} - 5\nu_{1} \tag{5.7.4}
$$

and for the inverter,

$$
\nu_{a} = -3\nu_{2} \tag{5.7.5}
$$

Combining Eqs. (5.7.4) and (5.7.5) gives

$$
\nu_{o} = 3\nu_{2} - 5\nu_{1}
$$

which is the desired result. In Fig. 5.25, we may select  $R_{1} = 10 \mathrm{k}\Omega$  and  $R_{3} = 20 \mathrm{k}\Omega$  or  $R_{1} = R_{3} = 10 \mathrm{k}\Omega$ .

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-13/c95faf42-d8e0-4f06-a665-945fc5e108f1/41b4cce6795e3f3373f1d2fb8a2a82880b82eece547e6ad4b9ffcb742dff9959.jpg)  
Figure 5.25 For Example 5.7.

Design a difference amplifier with gain 7.5.

Answer: Typical:  $R_{1} = R_{3} = 20 \mathrm{k}\Omega$ ,  $R_{2} = R_{4} = 150 \mathrm{k}\Omega$ .

An instrumentation amplifier shown in Fig. 5.26 is an amplifier of low- level signals used in process control or measurement applications and commercially available in single- package units. Show that

$$
\nu_{o} = \frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}}\bigg(1 + \frac{2R_{3}}{R_{4}}\bigg)(\nu_{2} - \nu_{1})
$$

# Solution:

We recognize that the amplifier  $A_{3}$  in Fig. 5.26 is a difference amplifier. Thus, from Eq. (5.20),

$$
\nu_{o} = \frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}} (\nu_{o2} - \nu_{o1}) \tag{5.8.1}
$$

Since the op amps  $A_{1}$  and  $A_{2}$  draw no current, current  $i$  flows through the three resistors as though they were in series. Hence,

$$
\nu_{o1} - \nu_{o2} = i(R_{3} + R_{4} + R_{3}) = i(2R_{3} + R_{4}) \tag{5.8.2}
$$

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-13/c95faf42-d8e0-4f06-a665-945fc5e108f1/edf867be1cd1af23b1f6eb610342c0992ed416d2e2b85439b238ce09b3a139e3.jpg)  
Figure 5.26 Instrumentation amplifier; for Example 5.8.

But

$$
i = \frac{\nu_{a} - \nu_{b}}{R_{4}}
$$

and  $\nu_{a} = \nu_{1}, \nu_{b} = \nu_{2}$ . Therefore,

$$
i = \frac{\nu_{1} - \nu_{2}}{R_{4}} \tag{5.8.3}
$$

Inserting Eqs. (5.8.2) and (5.8.3) into Eq. (5.8.1) gives

$$
\nu_{o} = \frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}}\left(1 + \frac{2R_{3}}{R_{4}}\right)\left(\nu_{2} - \nu_{1}\right)
$$

as required. We will discuss the instrumentation amplifier in detail in Section 5.10.

# 5.8 Cascaded Op Amp Circuits

5.8 Cascaded Op Amp CircuitsAs we know, op amp circuits are modules or building blocks for designing complex circuits. It is often necessary in practical applications to connect op amp circuits in cascade (i.e., head to tail) to achieve a large overall gain. In general, two circuits are cascaded when they are connected in tandem, one behind another in a single file.

A cascade connection is a head- to- tail arrangement of two or more op amp circuits such that the output of one is the input of the next.

When op amp circuits are cascaded, each circuit in the string is called a stage; the original input signal is increased by the gain of the individual stage. Op amp circuits have the advantage that they can be cascaded without changing their input- output relationships. This is due to the fact that each (ideal) op amp circuit has infinite input resistance and zero output resistance. Figure 5.28 displays a block diagram representation of three op amp circuits in cascade. Since the output of one stage is the input to the next stage, the overall gain of the cascade connection is the product of the gains of the individual op amp circuits, or

$$
A = A_{1}A_{2}A_{3} \tag{5.22}
$$

Although the cascade connection does not affect the op amp input- output relationships, care must be exercised in the design of an actual op amp circuit to ensure that the load due to the next stage in the cascade does not saturate the op amp.

Figure 5.28 A three-stage cascaded connection.

Find  $\nu_{o}$  and  $i_{o}$  in the circuit in Fig. 5.29.

# Solution:

This circuit consists of two noninverting amplifiers cascaded. At the output of the first op amp,

$$
\nu_{a} = \Big(1 + \frac{12}{3}\Big)(20) = 100\mathrm{mV}
$$

At the output of the second op amp,

$$
\nu_{o} = \Big(1 + \frac{10}{4}\Big)\nu_{a} = (1 + 2.5)100 = 350\mathrm{mV}
$$

The required current  $i_{o}$  is the current through the  $10 - \mathrm{k}\Omega$  resistor.

$$
i_{o} = \frac{\nu_{o} - \nu_{b}}{10}\mathrm{mA}
$$

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-13/c95faf42-d8e0-4f06-a665-945fc5e108f1/9047d0aada26b89576d8966475eb018abf04a0ebef5e63c7c3f8012c4fb97f6e.jpg)  
Figure 5.29 For Example 5.9.

But  $\nu_{b} = \nu_{a} = 100 \mathrm{mV}$ . Hence,

$$
i_{o} = \frac{(350 - 100) \times 10^{-3}}{10 \times 10^{3}} = 25 \mu \mathrm{A}
$$

Determine  $\nu_{o}$  and  $i_{o}$  in the op amp circuit in Fig. 5.30.

Answer:  $6 \mathrm{V}, 24 \mu \mathrm{A}$ .

If  $\nu_{1} = 1 \mathrm{V}$  and  $\nu_{2} = 2 \mathrm{V}$ , find  $\nu_{o}$  in the op amp circuit of Fig. 5.31.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-13/c95faf42-d8e0-4f06-a665-945fc5e108f1/b82ce9fc6b3722ae94d061ab486e5f2784c9f600e0259d16090f2e76986fffb8.jpg)  
Figure 5.31 For Example 5.10.

# Solution:

1. Define. The problem is clearly defined.

2. Present. With an input of  $\nu_{1}$  of  $1 \mathrm{V}$  and of  $\nu_{2}$  of  $2 \mathrm{V}$ , determine the output voltage of the circuit shown in Figure 5.31. The op amp circuit is actually composed of three circuits. The first circuit acts as an amplifier of gain  $-3(-6 \mathrm{k}\Omega /2 \mathrm{k}\Omega)$  for  $\nu_{1}$  and the second functions as an amplifier of gain  $-2(-8 \mathrm{k}\Omega /4 \mathrm{k}\Omega)$  for  $\nu_{2}$ . The last circuit serves as a summer of two different gains for the output of the other two circuits.

3. Alternative. There are different ways of working with this circuit. Because it involves ideal op amps, then a purely mathematical

approach will work quite easily. A second approach would be to use PSpice as a confirmation of the math.

4. Attempt. Let the output of the first op amp circuit be designated as  $\nu_{11}$  and the output of the second op amp circuit be designated as  $\nu_{22}$ . Then we get

$$
\begin{array}{c}\nu_{11} = -3\nu_{1} = -3\times 1 = -3\mathrm{~V}, \\ \nu_{22} = -2\nu_{2} = -2\times 2 = -4\mathrm{~V} \end{array}
$$

In the third circuit we have

$$
\begin{array}{c}\nu_{o} = -(10\mathrm{k}\Omega /5\mathrm{k}\Omega)\nu_{11} + [-(10\mathrm{k}\Omega /15\mathrm{k}\Omega)\nu_{22}] \\ = -(2 / 3) - (2 / 3)(-4) \\ = 6 + 2.667 = 8.667\mathrm{~V} \end{array}
$$

5. Evaluate. To properly evaluate our solution, we need to identify a reasonable check. Here we can easily use PSpice to provide that check.

Now we can simulate this in PSpice. The results are shown in Fig. 5.32.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-13/c95faf42-d8e0-4f06-a665-945fc5e108f1/2fecca9227ab21de5bc9f7b0a391dc0d7e9a9fda2fb8bf4abdf40a4eadfbc98e.jpg)  
Figure 5.32 For Example 5.10.

We obtain the same results using two entirely different techniques (the first is to treat the op amp circuits as just gains and a summer and the second is to use circuit analysis with PSpice). This is a very good method of assuring that we have the correct answer.

6. Satisfactory? We are satisfied we have obtained the asked for results. We can now present our work as a solution to the problem.

# 5.9 Op Amp Circuit Analysis with PSpice

5.9 Op Amp Circuit Analysis with PSpicePSpice for Windows does not have a model for an ideal op amp, although one may create one as a subcircuit using the Create Subcircuit line in the Tools menu. Rather than creating an ideal op amp, we will use one of the four nonideal, commercially available op amps supplied in the PSpice library eval.slb. The op amp models have the part names LF411, LM111, LM324, and uA741, as shown in Fig. 5.34. Each of them can be obtained from Draw/Get New Part/libraries · · · /eval.lib or by simply selecting Draw/Get New Part and typing the part name in the PartName dialog box, as usual. Note that each of them requires dc supplies, without which the op amp will not work. The dc supplies should be connected as shown in Fig. 5.3.

Figure 5.34 Nonideal op amp model available in PSpice.

Use PSpice to solve the op amp circuit for Example 5.1.

# Solution:

Using Schematics, we draw the circuit in Fig. 5.6(a) as shown in Fig.A5.35. Notice that the positive terminal of the voltage source  $\nu_{s}$  is connected to the inverting terminal (pin 2) via the  $10 - \mathrm{k}\Omega$  resistor, while the noninverting terminal (pin 3) is grounded as required in Fig. 5.6(a). Also, notice how the op amp is powered; the positive power supply terminal  $\mathrm{V}+$  (pin 7) is connected to a 15- V dc voltage source, while the negative power supply terminal  $\mathrm{V}-$  (pin 4) is connected to  $- 15\mathrm{V}$ . Pins 1 and 5 are left floating because they are used for offset null adjustment, which does not concern us in this chapter. Besides adding the dc power supplies to the original circuit in Fig. 5.6(a), we have also added pseudocomponents VIEWPOINT and IPROBE to respectively measure the output voltage  $\nu_{\mathrm{o}}$  at pin 6 and the required current  $i$  through the  $20 - \mathrm{k}\Omega$  resistor.

Figure 5.36 Four-bit DAC: (a) block diagram, (b) binary weighted ladder type.

In practice, the voltage levels may be typically  $0$  and  $\pm 5 \mathrm{~V}$ .

# 5.10 Applications

The op amp is a fundamental building block in modern electronic instrumentation. It is used extensively in many devices, along with resistors and other passive elements. Its numerous practical applications include instrumentation amplifiers, digital- to- analog converters, analog computers, level shifters, filters, calibration circuits, inverters, summers, integrators, differentiators, subtractors, logarithmic amplifiers, comparators, gyrators, oscillators, rectifiers, regulators, voltage- to- current converters, current- to- voltage converters, and clippers. Some of these we have already considered. We will consider two more applications here: the digital- to- analog converter and the instrumentation amplifier.

# 5.10.1 Digital-to-Analog Converter

The digital- to- analog converter (DAC) transforms digital signals into analog form. A typical example of a four- bit DAC is illustrated in Fig. 5.36(a). The four- bit DAC can be realized in many ways. A simple realization is the binary weighted ladder, shown in Fig. 5.36(b). The bits are weights according to the magnitude of their place value, by descending value of  $R_{f} / R_{n}$  so that each lesser bit has half the weight of the next higher. This is obviously an inverting summing amplifier. The output is related to the inputs as shown in Eq. (5.15). Thus,

$$
-V_{o} = \frac{R_{f}}{R_{1}} V_{1} + \frac{R_{f}}{R_{2}} V_{2} + \frac{R_{f}}{R_{3}} V_{3} + \frac{R_{f}}{R_{4}} V_{4} \tag{5.23}
$$

Input  $V_{1}$  is called the most significant bit (MSB), while input  $V_{4}$  is the least significant bit (LSB). Each of the four binary inputs  $V_{1}, \ldots , V_{4}$  can assume only two voltage levels: 0 or  $1 \mathrm{~V}$ . By using the proper input and feedback resistor values, the DAC provides a single output that is proportional to the inputs.

# Example 5.12

In the op amp circuit of Fig. 5.36(b), let  $R_{f} = 10 \mathrm{k} \Omega$ ,  $R_{1} = 10 \mathrm{k} \Omega$ ,  $R_{2} = 20 \mathrm{k} \Omega$ ,  $R_{3} = 40 \mathrm{k} \Omega$ , and  $R_{4} = 80 \mathrm{k} \Omega$ . Obtain the analog output for binary inputs [0000], [0001], [0010], ..., [1111].

# Solution:

Substituting the given values of the input and feedback resistors in Eq. (5.23) gives

$$
-V_{o} = \frac{R_{f}}{R_{1}} V_{1} + \frac{R_{f}}{R_{2}} V_{2} + \frac{R_{f}}{R_{3}} V_{3} + \frac{R_{f}}{R_{4}} V_{4}
$$

$$
= V_{1} + 0.5V_{2} + 0.25V_{3} + 0.125V_{3}
$$

Using this equation, a digital input  $[V_{1}V_{2}V_{3}V_{4}] = [0000]$  produces an analog output of  $- V_{o} = 0 \mathrm{~V}$ ;  $[V_{1}V_{2}V_{3}V_{4}] = [0001]$  gives  $- V_{o} = 0.125 \mathrm{~V}$ .

Similarly,

$$
\begin{array}{r c l}{[V_{1}V_{2}V_{3}V_{4}] = [0010]} & \Rightarrow & {-V_{o} = 0.25\mathrm{~V~}}\\ {[V_{1}V_{2}V_{3}V_{4}] = [0011]} & \Rightarrow & {-V_{o} = 0.25 + 0.125 = 0.375\mathrm{~V~}}\\ {[V_{1}V_{2}V_{3}V_{4}] = [0100]} & \Rightarrow & {-V_{o} = 0.5\mathrm{~V~}}\\ & \vdots \\ {[V_{1}V_{2}V_{3}V_{4}] = [1111]} & \Rightarrow & {-V_{o} = 1 + 0.5 + 0.25 + 0.125}\\ & & {= 1.875\mathrm{~V~}} \end{array}
$$

Table 5.2 summarizes the result of the digital- to- analog conversion. Note that we have assumed that each bit has a value of  $0.125 \mathrm{V}$ . Thus, in this system, we cannot represent a voltage between 1.000 and 1.125, for example. This lack of resolution is a major limitation of digital- to- analog conversions. For greater accuracy, a word representation with a greater number of bits is required. Even then a digital representation of an analog voltage is never exact. In spite of this inexact representation, digital representation has been used to accomplish remarkable things such as audio CDs and digital photography.

# 5.10.2 Instrumentation Amplifiers

One of the most useful and versatile op amp circuits for precision measurement and process control is the instrumentation amplifier (IA), so called because of its widespread use in measurement systems. Typical applications of IAs include isolation amplifiers, thermocouple amplifiers, and data acquisition systems.

The instrumentation amplifier is an extension of the difference amplifier in that it amplifies the difference between its input signals. As shown in Fig. 5.26 (see Example 5.8), an instrumentation amplifier typically consists of three op amps and seven resistors. For convenience, the amplifier is shown again in Fig. 5.38(a), where the resistors are made equal except for the external gain- setting resistor  $R_{G}$ , connected between the gain set terminals. Figure 5.38(b) shows its schematic symbol. Example 5.8 showed that

$$
\nu_{o} = A_{\nu}(\nu_{2} - \nu_{1}) \tag{5.24}
$$

where the voltage gain is

$$
A_{\nu} = 1 + \frac{2R}{R_{G}} \tag{5.25}
$$

As shown in Fig. 5.39, the instrumentation amplifier amplifies small differential signal voltages superimposed on larger common- mode

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-13/c95faf42-d8e0-4f06-a665-945fc5e108f1/e1b89db9f06789bd0ae3e6cc3bcd4fb4798c7e46efbf9e7ed5acc8fb4c0f5872.jpg)

voltages. Since the common- mode voltages are equal, they cancel each other.

The IA has three major characteristics:

1. The voltage gain is adjusted by one external resistor  $R_{G}$

2. The input impedance of both inputs is very high and does not vary as the gain is adjusted.

3. The output  $\nu_{o}$  depends on the difference between the inputs  $\nu_{1}$  and  $\nu_{2}$ , not on the voltage common to them (common-mode voltage).

Due to the widespread use of IAs, manufacturers have developed these amplifiers on single- package units. A typical example is the LH0036, developed by National Semiconductor. The gain can be varied from 1 to 1,000 by an external resistor whose value may vary from 100 to  $10 \mathrm{k}\Omega$ .

In Fig. 5.38, let  $R = 10 \mathrm{k}\Omega$ ,  $\nu_{1} = 2.011 \mathrm{V}$ , and  $\nu_{2} = 2.017 \mathrm{V}$ . If  $R_{G}$  is adjusted to  $500 \Omega$ , determine: (a) the voltage gain, (b) the output voltage  $\nu_{o}$ .

# Solution:

(a) The voltage gain is

$$
A_{\nu} = 1 + \frac{2R}{R_{G}} = 1 + \frac{2\times 10,000}{500} = 41
$$

(b) The output voltage is

$$
\nu_{o} = A_{\nu}(\nu_{2} - \nu_{1}) = 41(2.017 - 2.011) = 41(6) \mathrm{mV} = 246 \mathrm{mV}
$$

Determine the value of the external gain- setting resistor  $R_{G}$  required for the IA in Fig. 5.38 to produce a gain of 142 when  $R = 25 \mathrm{k}\Omega$ .

Answer:  $354.6 \Omega$

# Enhancing Your Skills and Your Career

ABET EC 2000 criteria (3. c), "an ability to design a system, component, or process to meet desired needs."

The "ability to design a system, component, or process to meet desired needs" is why engineers are hired. That is why this is the most important technical skill that an engineer has. Interestingly, your success as an engineer is directly proportional to your ability to communicate but your being able to design is why you will be hired in the first place.

Design takes place when you have what is termed an open- ended problem that eventually is defined by the solution. Within the context of this course or textbook, we can only explore some of the elements of design. Pursuing all of the steps of our problem- solving technique teaches you several of the most important elements of the design process.

Probably the most important part of design is clearly defining what the system, component, process, or, in our case, problem is. Rarely is an engineer given a perfectly clear assignment. Therefore, as a student, you can develop and enhance this skill by asking yourself, your colleagues, or your professors questions designed to clarify the problem statement.

Exploring alternative solutions is another important part of the design process. Again, as a student, you can practice this part of the design process on almost every problem you work.

Evaluating your solutions is critical to any engineering assignment. Again, this is a skill that you as a student can practice on every problem you work.

Learning ObjectivesBy using the information and exercises in this chapter you will be able to:1. Fully understand the volt- amp characteristics of capacitors and inductors and their use in basic circuits.2. Explain how capacitors behave when combined in parallel and in series.3. Understand how inductors behave when combined in parallel and in series.4. Know how to create integrators using capacitors and op amps.5. Learn how to create differentiators and their limitations.6. Learn how to create analog computers and to understand how they can be used to solve linear differential equations.

In contrast to a resistor, which spends or dissipates energy irreversibly, an inductor or capacitor stores or releases energy (i.e., has a memory).

# 6.1 Introduction

So far we have limited our study to resistive circuits. In this chapter, we shall introduce two new and important passive linear circuit elements: the capacitor and the inductor. Unlike resistors, which dissipate energy, capacitors and inductors do not dissipate but store energy, which can be retrieved at a later time. For this reason, capacitors and inductors are called storage elements.

The application of resistive circuits is quite limited. With the introduction of capacitors and inductors in this chapter, we will be able to analyze more important and practical circuits. Be assured that the circuit analysis techniques covered in Chapters 3 and 4 are equally applicable to circuits with capacitors and inductors.

We begin by introducing capacitors and describing how to combine them in series or in parallel. Later, we do the same for inductors. As typical applications, we explore how capacitors are combined with op amps to form integrators, differentiators, and analog computers.

# 6.2 Capacitors

A capacitor is a passive element designed to store energy in its electric field. Besides resistors, capacitors are the most common electrical components. Capacitors are used extensively in electronics, communications, computers, and power systems. For example, they are used in the tuning circuits of radio receivers and as dynamic memory elements in computer systems.

A capacitor is typically constructed as depicted in Fig. 6.1.

A capacitor consists of two conducting plates separated by an insulator (or dielectric).

In many practical applications, the plates may be aluminum foil while the dielectric may be air, ceramic, paper, or mica.

# Historical

Michael Faraday (1791- 1867), an English chemist and physicist, was probably the greatest experimentalist who ever lived.

Born near London, Faraday realized his boyhood dream by working with the great chemist Sir Humphry Davy at the Royal Institution, where he worked for 54 years. He made several contributions in all areas of physical science and coined such words as electrolysis, anode, and cathode. His discovery of electromagnetic induction in 1831 was a major breakthrough in engineering because it provided a way of generating electricity. The electric motor and generator operate on this principle. The unit of capacitance, the farad, was named in his honor.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-13/c95faf42-d8e0-4f06-a665-945fc5e108f1/44089701188ecd86cb3b54d138684650d812c8554692603db0ca2108c888fe0f.jpg)

When a voltage source  $\nu$  is connected to the capacitor, as in Fig. 6.2, the source deposits a positive charge  $q$  on one plate and a negative charge  $- q$  on the other. The capacitor is said to store the electric charge. The amount of charge stored, represented by  $q$ , is directly proportional to the applied voltage  $\nu$  so that

$$
q = C\nu \tag{6.1}
$$

where  $C$ , the constant of proportionality, is known as the capacitance of the capacitor. The unit of capacitance is the farad (F), in honor of the English physicist Michael Faraday (1791- 1867). From Eq. (6.1), we may derive the following definition.

Capacitance is the ratio of the charge on one plate of a capacitor to the voltage difference between the two plates, measured in farads (F).

Note from Eq. (6.1) that 1 farad  $= 1$  coulomb/volt.

Although the capacitance  $C$  of a capacitor is the ratio of the charge  $q$  per plate to the applied voltage  $\nu$ , it does not depend on  $q$  or  $\nu$ . It depends on the physical dimensions of the capacitor. For example, for the parallel- plate capacitor shown in Fig. 6.1, the capacitance is given by

$$
C = \frac{\epsilon A}{d} \tag{6.2}
$$

where  $A$  is the surface area of each plate,  $d$  is the distance between the plates, and  $\epsilon$  is the permittivity of the dielectric material between the plates. Although Eq. (6.2) applies to only parallel- plate capacitors, we may infer from it that, in general, three factors determine the value of the capacitance:

1. The surface area of the plates—the larger the area, the greater the capacitance.  
2. The spacing between the plates—the smaller the spacing, the greater the capacitance.

Figure 6.2 A capacitor with applied voltage  $\nu$ .

Alternatively, capacitance is the amount of charge stored per plate for a unit voltage difference in a capacitor.

Capacitor voltage rating and capacitance are typically inversely rated due to the relationships in Eqs. (6.1) and (6.2). Arcing occurs if  $d$  is small and  $V$  is high.

Figure 6.3 Circuit symbols for capacitors: (a) fixed capacitor, (b) variable capacitor.

3. The permittivity of the material—the higher the permittivity, the greater the capacitance.

Capacitors are commercially available in different values and types. Typically, capacitors have values in the picofarad (pF) to microfarad  $(\mu \mathrm{F})$  range. They are described by the dielectric material they are made of and by whether they are of fixed or variable type. Figure 6.3 shows the circuit symbols for fixed and variable capacitors. Note that according to the passive sign convention, if  $\nu >0$  and  $i > 0$  or if  $\nu < 0$  and  $i< 0$  ,the capacitor is being charged, and if  $\nu \cdot i< 0$  , the capacitor is discharging.

Figure 6.5 Variable capacitor. Charles Alexander

Figure 6.4 shows common types of fixed- value capacitors. Polyester capacitors are light in weight, stable, and their change with temperature is predictable. Instead of polyester, other dielectric materials such as mica and polystyrene may be used. Film capacitors are rolled and housed in metal or plastic films. Electrolytic capacitors produce very high capacitance. Figure 6.5 shows the most common types of variable capacitors. The capacitance of a trimmer (or padder) capacitor is often placed in parallel with another capacitor so that the equivalent capacitance can be varied slightly. The capacitance of the variable air capacitor (meshed plates) is varied by turning the shaft. Variable capacitors are used in radio receivers allowing one to tune to various stations. In addition, capacitors are used to block dc, pass ac, shift phase, store energy, start motors, and suppress noise.

To obtain the current- voltage relationship of the capacitor, we take the derivative of both sides of Eq. (6.1). Since

$$
i = \frac{dq}{dt} \tag{6.3}
$$

differentiating both sides of Eq. (6.1) gives

$$
i = C\frac{d\nu}{dt} \tag{6.4}
$$

According to Eq. (6.4), for a capacitor to carry current, its voltage must vary with time. Hence, for constant voltage,  $i = 0$ .

This is the current- voltage relationship for a capacitor, assuming the passive sign convention. The relationship is illustrated in Fig. 6.6 for a capacitor whose capacitance is independent of voltage. Capacitors that satisfy Eq. (6.4) are said to be linear. For a nonlinear capacitor, the plot of the current- voltage relationship is not a straight line. Although some

capacitors are nonlinear, most are linear. We will assume linear capacitors in this book.

The voltage- current relation of the capacitor can be obtained by integrating both sides of Eq. (6.4). We get

$$
\nu (t) = \frac{1}{C}\int_{-\infty}^{t}i(\tau)d\tau \tag{6.5}
$$

or

$$
\nu (t) = \frac{1}{C}\int_{t_0}^{t}i(\tau)d\tau +\nu (t_0) \tag{6.6}
$$

where  $\nu (t_0) = q(t_0) / C$  is the voltage across the capacitor at time  $t_0$ . Equation (6.6) shows that capacitor voltage depends on the past history of the capacitor current. Hence, the capacitor has memory—a property that is often exploited.

The instantaneous power delivered to the capacitor is

$$
p = \nu i = C\nu \frac{d\nu}{dt} \tag{6.7}
$$

The energy stored in the capacitor is therefore

$$
w = \int_{-\infty}^{t}p(\tau)d\tau = C\int_{-\infty}^{t}\nu \frac{d\nu}{dt} d\tau = C\int_{(\infty -\infty)}^{\nu (t)}\nu d\nu = \frac{1}{2} C\nu^{2}\int_{(\infty -\infty)}^{\nu (t)}\nu d\nu = \frac{1}{2} C\nu^{2} \tag{6.8}
$$

We note that  $\nu (- \infty) = 0$ , because the capacitor was uncharged at  $t = - \infty$ . Thus,

$$
w = \frac{1}{2} C\nu^{2} \tag{6.9}
$$

Using Eq. (6.1), we may rewrite Eq. (6.9) as

$$
w = \frac{q^2}{2C} \tag{6.10}
$$

Equation (6.9) or (6.10) represents the energy stored in the electric field that exists between the plates of the capacitor. This energy can be retrieved, since an ideal capacitor cannot dissipate energy. In fact, the word capacitor is derived from this element's capacity to store energy in an electric field.

We should note the following important properties of a capacitor:

1. Note from Eq. (6.4) that when the voltage across a capacitor is not changing with time (i.e., dc voltage), the current through the capacitor is zero. Thus,

A capacitor is an open circuit to dc.

However, if a battery (dc voltage) is connected across a capacitor, the capacitor charges.

Figure 6.6 Current-voltage relationship of a capacitor.

An alternative way of looking at this is using Eq. (6.6), which indicates that energy is proportional to voltage squared. Since injecting or extracting energy can only be done over some finite time, voltage cannot change instantaneously across a capacitor.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-13/c95faf42-d8e0-4f06-a665-945fc5e108f1/a3370bfd5a242726e11157a65afc5f729d966780386c8d5c50fc27c1e2e796fb.jpg)

Figure 6.8 Circuit model of a nonideal capacitor.

2. The voltage on the capacitor must be continuous.

The voltage on a capacitor cannot change abruptly.

The capacitor resists an abrupt change in the voltage across it. According to Eq. (6.4), a discontinuous change in voltage requires an infinite current, which is physically impossible. For example, the voltage across a capacitor may take the form shown in Fig. 6.7(a), whereas it is not physically possible for the capacitor voltage to take the form shown in Fig. 6.7(b) because of the abrupt changes. Conversely, the current through a capacitor can change instantaneously.

3. The ideal capacitor does not dissipate energy. It takes power from the circuit when storing energy in its field and returns previously stored energy when delivering power to the circuit.

4. A real, nonideal capacitor has a parallel-model leakage resistance, as shown in Fig. 6.8. The leakage resistance may be as high as  $100~\mathrm{M}\Omega$  and can be neglected for most practical applications. For this reason, we will assume ideal capacitors in this book.

# Example 6.1

(a) Calculate the charge stored on a 3-pF capacitor with  $20~\mathrm{V}$  across it. 
(b) Find the energy stored in the capacitor.

# Solution:

(a) Since  $q = C\nu$

$$
q = 3\times 10^{-12}\times 20 = 60\mathrm{pC}
$$

(b) The energy stored is

$$
w = \frac{1}{2} C\nu^{2} = \frac{1}{2}\times 3\times 10^{-12}\times 400 = 600\mathrm{pJ}
$$

# Practice Problem 6.1

What is the voltage across a  $4.5 - \mu \mathrm{F}$  capacitor if the charge on one plate is  $0.12~\mathrm{mC}$ ? How much energy is stored?

Answer:  $26.67~\mathrm{V}$ ,  $1.6~\mathrm{mJ}$ .

# Example 6.2

The voltage across a  $5 - \mu \mathrm{F}$  capacitor is

$$
\nu (t) = 10\cos 6000t\mathrm{V}
$$

Calculate the current through it.

# Solution:

By definition, the current is

$$
\begin{array}{l}i(t) = C\frac{d\nu}{dt} = 5\times 10^{-6}\frac{d}{dt} (10\cos 6000t)\\ = -5\times 10^{-6}\times 6000\times 10\sin 6000t = -0.3\sin 6000t\mathrm{~A~} \end{array}
$$

If a  $10 - \mu \mathrm{F}$  capacitor is connected to a voltage source with

$$
\nu (t) = 75\sin (2,000t)\mathrm{~V~}
$$

determine the current through the capacitor.

Answer:  $1.5\cos (2,000t)\mathrm{~V~}$

Determine the voltage across a  $2 - \mu \mathrm{F}$  capacitor if the current through it is

$$
i(t) = 6e^{-3000t}\mathrm{mA}
$$

Assume that the initial capacitor voltage is zero.

# Solution:

Since  $\nu = \frac{1}{C}\int_{0}^{t}i d\tau +\nu (0)$  and  $\nu (0) = 0$

$$
\begin{array}{l}{{\nu=\frac{1}{2\times10^{-6}}\int_{0}^{t}6e^{-3000\tau}d\tau\cdot10^{-3}}}\\ {{=\frac{3\times10^{3}}{-3000}e^{-3000\tau}\Big|_{0}^{t}=(1-e^{-3000\tau})\mathrm{~V~}}}\end{array}
$$

The current through a  $100 - \mu \mathrm{F}$  capacitor is  $i(t) = 50$  sin  $120\pi t\mathrm{mA}$  . Calculate the voltage across it at  $t = 1$  ms and  $t = 5$  ms. Take  $\nu (0) = 0$

Answer:  $93.14\mathrm{mV}$  1.736 V.

Determine the current through a  $200 - \mu \mathrm{F}$  capacitor whose voltage is shown in Fig. 6.9.

# Solution:

The voltage waveform can be described mathematically as

$$
\nu (t) = \left\{ \begin{array}{c c}{50t\mathrm{~V~}} & {0< t< 1}\\ {100 - 50t\mathrm{~V~}} & {1< t< 3}\\ {-200 + 50t\mathrm{~V~}} & {3< t< 4}\\ {0} & \mathrm{otherwise} \end{array} \right.
$$

Since  $i = C d\nu /d t$  and  $C = 200\mu \mathrm{F},$  we take the derivative of  $\nu$  to obtain

$$
i(t) = 200\times 10^{-6}\times \left\{ \begin{array}{c c}{50} & {0< t< 1}\\ {-50} & {1< t< 3}\\ {50} & {3< t< 4}\\ {0} & \mathrm{otherwise} \end{array} \right.
$$

$$
= \left\{ \begin{array}{c c}{10\mathrm{mA}} & {0< t< 1}\\ {-10\mathrm{mA}} & {1< t< 3}\\ {10\mathrm{mA}} & {3< t< 4}\\ {0} & \mathrm{otherwise} \end{array} \right.
$$

Thus, the current waveform is as shown in Fig. 6.10.

Obtain the energy stored in each capacitor in Fig. 6.12(a) under dc conditions.

Under dc conditions, we replace each capacitor with an open circuit, as shown in Fig. 6.12(b). The current through the series combination of the  $2 - \mathrm{k}\Omega$  and  $4 - \mathrm{k}\Omega$  resistors is obtained by current division as

# 6.3 Series and Parallel Capacitors

We know from resistive circuits that the series- parallel combination is a powerful tool for reducing circuits. This technique can be extended to series- parallel connections of capacitors, which are sometimes encountered. We desire to replace these capacitors by a single equivalent capacitor  $C_{\mathrm{eq}}$ .

In order to obtain the equivalent capacitor  $C_{\mathrm{eq}}$  of  $N$  capacitors in parallel, consider the circuit in Fig. 6.14(a). The equivalent circuit is

in Fig. 6.14(b). Note that the capacitors have the same voltage  $\nu$  across them. Applying KCL to Fig. 6.14(a),

$$
i = i_{1} + i_{2} + i_{3} + \dots +i_{N} \tag{6.11}
$$

But  $i_{k} = C_{k}d\nu /dt$  .Hence,

$$
\begin{array}{l} i = C_1\frac{d\nu}{dt} +C_2\frac{d\nu}{dt} +C_3\frac{d\nu}{dt} +\dots +C_N\frac{d\nu}{dt} \\ \displaystyle = \left(\sum_{k = 1}^{N}C_k\right)\frac{d\nu}{dt} = C_{\mathrm{eq}}\frac{d\nu}{dt} \end{array} \tag{6.12}
$$

where

$$
C_{\mathrm{eq}} = C_1 + C_2 + C_3 + \dots +C_N \tag{6.13}
$$

(b)  
Figure 6.14 (a) Parallel-connected  $N$  capacitors, (b) equivalent circuit for the parallel capacitors.

The equivalent capacitance of  $N$  parallel- connected capacitors is the sum of the individual capacitances.

We observe that capacitors in parallel combine in the same manner as resistors in series.

We now obtain  $C_{\mathrm{eq}}$  of  $N$  capacitors connected in series by comparing the circuit in Fig. 6.15(a) with the equivalent circuit in Fig. 6.15(b). Note that the same current  $i$  flows (and consequently the same charge) through the capacitors. Applying KVL to the loop in Fig. 6.15(a),

$$
\nu = \nu_{1} + \nu_{2} + \nu_{3} + \dots +\nu_{N} \tag{6.14}
$$

But  $\nu_{k} = \frac{1}{C_{k}}\int_{t_{0}}^{t}i(\tau) d\tau +\nu_{k}(t_{0})$  . Therefore,

$$
\begin{array}{c}{\nu = \frac{1}{C_1}\int_{t_0}^t i(\tau) d\tau +\nu_1(t_0) + \frac{1}{C_2}\int_{t_0}^t i(\tau) d\tau +\nu_2(t_0)}\\ {+\dots +\frac{1}{C_N}\int_{t_0}^t i(\tau) d\tau +\nu_N(t_0)} \end{array}
$$

$$
= \left(\frac{1}{C_1} +\frac{1}{C_2} +\dots +\frac{1}{C_N}\right)\int_{t_0}^{t}i(\tau) d\tau +\nu_1(t_0) + \nu_2(t_0)

where

$$
\frac{1}{C_{\mathrm{eq}}} = \frac{1}{C_1} +\frac{1}{C_2} +\frac{1}{C_3} +\dots +\frac{1}{C_N} \tag{6.16}
$$

The initial voltage  $\nu (t_{0})$  across  $C_{\mathrm{eq}}$  is required by KVL to be the sum of the capacitor voltages at  $t_{0}$ . Or according to Eq. (6.15),

$$
\nu (t_{0}) = \nu_{1}(t_{0}) + \nu_{2}(t_{0}) + \dots + \nu_{N}(t_{0})
$$

Thus, according to Eq. (6.16),

The equivalent capacitance of series- connected capacitors is the reciprocal of the sum of the reciprocals of the individual capacitances.

Note that capacitors in series combine in the same manner as resistors in parallel. For  $N = 2$  (i.e., two capacitors in series), Eq. (6.16) becomes

$$
\frac{1}{C_{\mathrm{eq}}} = \frac{1}{C_{1}} + \frac{1}{C_{2}}
$$

or

$$
C_{\mathrm{eq}} = \frac{C_{1} C_{2}}{C_{1} + C_{2}} \tag{6.17}
$$

Figure 6.16 For Example 6.6.

# Solution:

The  $20 - \mu \mathrm{F}$  and  $5 - \mu \mathrm{F}$  capacitors are in series; their equivalent capacitance is

$$
\frac{20 \times 5}{20 + 5} = 4 \mu \mathrm{F}
$$

This  $4 - \mu \mathrm{F}$  capacitor is in parallel with the  $6 - \mu \mathrm{F}$  and  $20 - \mu \mathrm{F}$  capacitors; their combined capacitance is

$$
4 + 6 + 20 = 30 \mu \mathrm{F}
$$

This  $30 - \mu \mathrm{F}$  capacitor is in series with the  $60 - \mu \mathrm{F}$  capacitor. Hence, the equivalent capacitance for the entire circuit is

$$
C_{\mathrm{eq}} = \frac{30 \times 60}{30 + 60} = 20 \mu \mathrm{F}
$$

Figure 6.17 For Practice Prob. 6.6.

For the circuit in Fig. 6.18, find the voltage across each capacitor.

# Solution:

We first find the equivalent capacitance  $C_{\mathrm{eq}}$ , shown in Fig. 6.19. The two parallel capacitors in Fig. 6.18 can be combined to get  $40 + 20 = 60 \mathrm{mF}$ . This  $60 - \mathrm{mF}$  capacitor is in series with the  $20 - \mathrm{mF}$  and  $30 - \mathrm{mF}$  capacitors. Thus,

$$
C_{\mathrm{eq}} = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{60} + \frac{1}{30} + \frac{1}{20}}\mathrm{mF} = 10\mathrm{mF}
$$

The total charge is

$$
q = C_{\mathrm{eq}}\nu = 10\times 10^{-3}\times 30 = 0.3\mathrm{C}
$$

This is the charge on the  $20 - \mathrm{mF}$  and  $30 - \mathrm{mF}$  capacitors, because they are in series with the  $30 - \mathrm{V}$  source. (A crude way to see this is to imagine that charge acts like current, since  $i = dq / dt$ .) Therefore,

$$
\nu_{1} = \frac{q}{C_{1}} = \frac{0.3}{20\times 10^{-3}} = 15\mathrm{V}\qquad \nu_{2} = \frac{q}{C_{2}} = \frac{0.3}{30\times 10^{-3}} = 10\mathrm{V}
$$

Having determined  $\nu_{1}$  and  $\nu_{2}$ , we now use KVL to determine  $\nu_{3}$  by

$$
\nu_{3} = 30 - \nu_{1} - \nu_{2} = 5\mathrm{V}
$$

Alternatively, since the  $40 - \mathrm{mF}$  and  $20 - \mathrm{mF}$  capacitors are in parallel, they have the same voltage  $\nu_{3}$  and their combined capacitance is  $40 + 20 = 60 \mathrm{mF}$ . This combined capacitance is in series with the  $20 - \mathrm{mF}$  and  $30 - \mathrm{mF}$  capacitors and consequently has the same charge on it. Hence,

$$
\nu_{3} = \frac{q}{60\mathrm{mF}} = \frac{0.3}{60\times 10^{-3}} = 5\mathrm{V}
$$

Find the voltage across each of the capacitors in Fig. 6.20.

Answer:  $\nu_{1} = 45 \mathrm{V}, \nu_{2} = 45 \mathrm{V}, \nu_{3} = 15 \mathrm{V}, \nu_{4} = 30 \mathrm{V}$ .

# 6.4 Inductors

An inductor is a passive element designed to store energy in its magnetic field. Inductors find numerous applications in electronic and power systems. They are used in power supplies, transformers, radios, TVs, radars, and electric motors.

Any conductor of electric current has inductive properties and may be regarded as an inductor. But in order to enhance the inductive effect, a practical inductor is usually formed into a cylindrical coil with many turns of conducting wire, as shown in Fig. 6.21.

An inductor consists of a coil of conducting wire.

If current is allowed to pass through an inductor, it is found that the voltage across the inductor is directly proportional to the time rate of change of the current. Using the passive sign convention,

$$
\nu = L\frac{di}{dt} \tag{6.18}
$$

In view of Eq. (6.18), for an inductor to have voltage across its terminals, its current must vary with time. Hence,  $\nu = 0$  for constant current through the inductor.

where  $L$  is the constant of proportionality called the inductance of the inductor. The unit of inductance is the henry (H), named in honor of the American inventor Joseph Henry (1797- 1878). It is clear from Eq. (6.18) that 1 henry equals 1 volt- second per ampere.

Inductance is the property whereby an inductor exhibits opposition to the change of current flowing through it, measured in henrys (H).

The inductance of an inductor depends on its physical dimension and construction. Formulas for calculating the inductance of inductors of different shapes are derived from electromagnetic theory and can be found in standard electrical engineering handbooks. For example, for the inductor, (solenoid) shown in Fig. 6.21,

$$
L = \frac{N^2\mu A}{\ell} \tag{6.19}
$$

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-13/c95faf42-d8e0-4f06-a665-945fc5e108f1/ce600afa79139f359c3a576b8ebcf7fb5bedc2b488d3c9c1464f3f2347f4cf75.jpg)  
Figure 6.22 Various types of inductors: (a) solenoidal wound inductor, (b) toroidal inductor, (c) axial lead inductor. Mark Dierker/McGraw-Hill Education

where  $N$  is the number of turns,  $\ell$  is the length, A is the cross- sectional area, and  $\mu$  is the permeability of the core. We can see from Eq. (6.19) that inductance can be increased by increasing the number of turns of coil, using material with higher permeability as the core, increasing the cross- sectional area, or reducing the length of the coil.

Like capacitors, commercially available inductors come in different values and types. Typical practical inductors have inductance values ranging from a few microhenrys  $(\mu \mathrm{H})$  , as in communication systems, to tens of henrys (H) as in power systems. Inductors may be fixed or variable. The core may be made of iron, steel, plastic, or air. The terms coil and choke are also used for inductors. Common inductors are shown in Fig. 6.22. The circuit symbols for inductors are shown in Fig. 6.23, following the passive sign convention.

Equation (6.18) is the voltage- current relationship for an inductor. Figure 6.24 shows this relationship graphically for an inductor whose

# Historical

Joseph Henry (1797- 1878), an American physicist, discovered inductance and constructed an electric motor.

Joseph Henry (1797- 1878), an American physicist, discovered inductance and constructed an electric motor.Born in Albany, New York, Henry graduated from Albany Academy and taught philosophy at Princeton University from 1832 to 1846. He was the first secretary of the Smithsonian Institution. He conducted several experiments on electromagnetism and developed powerful electromagnets that could lift objects weighing thousands of pounds. Interestingly, Joseph Henry discovered electromagnetic induction before Faraday but failed to publish his findings. The unit of inductance, the henry, was named after him.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-13/c95faf42-d8e0-4f06-a665-945fc5e108f1/0df60870eebd428e31e96837d63c078b00bc0e8cc289b88343dbf3d715b747e0.jpg)

inductance is independent of current. Such an inductor is known as a linear inductor. For a nonlinear inductor, the plot of Eq. (6.18) will not be a straight line because its inductance varies with current. We will assume linear inductors in this textbook unless stated otherwise.

The current- voltage relationship is obtained from Eq. (6.18) as

$$
d i = \frac{1}{L}\nu d i
$$

Integrating gives

$$
i = \frac{1}{L}\int_{-\infty}^{t}\nu (\tau)d\tau \tag{6.20}
$$

or

$$
\boxed{i = \frac{1}{L}\int_{t_0}^{t}\nu (\tau)d\tau +i(t_0)} \tag{6.21}
$$

where  $i(t_{0})$  is the total current for  $- \infty < t< t_{0}$  and  $i(- \infty) = 0$  . The idea of making  $i(- \infty) = 0$  is practical and reasonable, because there must be a time in the past when there was no current in the inductor.

The inductor is designed to store energy in its magnetic field. The energy stored can be obtained from Eq. (6.18). The power delivered to the inductor is

$$
p = \nu i = \left(L\frac{d i}{d t}\right)i \tag{6.22}
$$

The energy stored is

$$
\begin{array}{l}{w = \int_{-\infty}^{t}p(\tau)d\tau = L\int_{-\infty}^{t}\frac{d i}{d\tau} i d\tau}\\ {= L\int_{-\infty}^{t}i d i = \frac{1}{2} L i^{2}(t) - \frac{1}{2} L i^{2}(-\infty)} \end{array} \tag{6.23}
$$

Since  $i(- \infty) = 0$

$$
w = \frac{1}{2} L i^{2} \tag{6.24}
$$

We should note the following important properties of an inductor.

1. Note from Eq. (6.18) that the voltage across an inductor is zero when the current is constant. Thus,

An inductor acts like a short circuit to dc.

2. An important property of the inductor is its opposition to the change in current flowing through it.

Figure 6.25 Current through an inductor: (a) allowed, (b) not allowable; an abrupt change is not possible.

Since an inductor is often made of a highly conducting wire, it has a very small resistance.

Figure 6.26 Circuit model for a practical inductor.

The current through an inductor cannot change instantaneously.

According to Eq. (6.18), a discontinuous change in the current through an inductor requires an infinite voltage, which is not physically possible. Thus, an inductor opposes an abrupt change in the current through it. For example, the current through an inductor may take the form shown in Fig. 6.25(a), whereas the inductor current cannot take the form shown in Fig. 6.25(b) in real- life situations due to the discontinuities. However, the voltage across an inductor can change abruptly.

3. Like the ideal capacitor, the ideal inductor does not dissipate energy. The energy stored in it can be retrieved at a later time. The inductor takes power from the circuit when storing energy and delivers power to the circuit when returning previously stored energy.

4. A practical, nonideal inductor has a significant resistive component, as shown in Fig. 6.26. This is due to the fact that the inductor is made of a conducting material such as copper, which has some resistance. This resistance is called the winding resistance  $R_{w}$ , and it appears in series with the inductance of the inductor. The presence of  $R_{w}$  makes it both an energy storage device and an energy dissipation device. Since  $R_{w}$  is usually very small, it is ignored in most cases. The nonideal inductor also has a winding capacitance  $C_{w}$  due to the capacitive coupling between the conducting coils.  $C_{w}$  is very small and can be ignored in most cases, except at high frequencies. We will assume ideal inductors in this book.

The current through a 0.1- H inductor is  $i(t) = 10te^{- 5t}$  A. Find the voltage across the inductor and the energy stored in it.

# Solution:

Since  $\nu = L di / dt$  and  $L = 0.1 \mathrm{H}$ ,

$$
\nu = 0.1\frac{d}{dt} (10te^{-5t}) = e^{-5t} + t(-5)e^{-5t} = e^{-5t}(1 - 5t)\mathrm{V}
$$

The energy stored is

$$
w = \frac{1}{2} L i^{2} = \frac{1}{2} (0.1)100t^{2}e^{-10t} = 5t^{2}e^{-10t}\mathrm{~J}
$$

If the current through a  $1\mathrm{- mH}$  inductor is  $i(t) = 60\cos (100t)$  mA, find the terminal voltage and the energy stored.

Answer:  $- 6\sin (100t)\mathrm{mV}$ $1.8\cos^{2}(100t)\mu \mathrm{J}$

Find the current through a 5- H inductor if the voltage across it is

$$
\nu(t)=\left\{{30t^{2},\qquad t>0}\atop0,\qquad t< 0\right.
$$

Also, find the energy stored at  $t = 5$  s. Assume  $i(\nu) > 0$

# Solution:

Since  $i = \frac{1}{L}\int_{t_{0}}^{t}\nu (\tau) d\tau +i(t_{0})$  and  $L = 5\mathrm{H}$

$$
i = \frac{1}{5}\int_{0}^{t}30\tau^{2}d\tau +0 = 6\times \frac{t^{3}}{3} = 2t^{3}\mathrm{A}
$$

The power  $p = \nu i = 60t^{5}$  , and the energy stored is then

$$
w = \int p d t = \int_{0}^{5}60t^{5}d t = 60\frac{t^{6}}{6}\bigg|_{0}^{5} = 156.25\mathrm{~kJ}
$$

Alternatively, we can obtain the energy stored using Eq. (6.24), by writing

$$
w\Big|_{0}^{5} = \frac{1}{2} L t^{2}(5) - \frac{1}{2} L i(0) = \frac{1}{2} (5)(2\times 5^{3})^{2} - 0 = 156.25\mathrm{~kJ}
$$

as obtained before.

The terminal voltage of a 2- H inductor is  $\nu = 10(1 - t)$  V. Find the current flowing through it at  $t = 4$  s and the energy stored in it at  $t = 4$  s. Assume  $i(0) = 2$  A.

Answer: - 18 A, 324 J.

Consider the circuit in Fig. 6.27(a). Under dc conditions, find: (a)  $i$ ,  $\nu_{C}$ , and  $i_{L}$ , (b) the energy stored in the capacitor and inductor.

# Solution:

(a) Under dc conditions, we replace the capacitor with an open circuit and the inductor with a short circuit, as in Fig. 6.27(b). It is evident from Fig. 6.27(b) that

$$
i = i_{L} = \frac{12}{1 + 5} = 2\mathrm{~A~}
$$

The voltage  $\nu_{C}$  is the same as the voltage across the  $5 - \Omega$  resistor. Hence,

$$
\nu_{C} = 5i = 10\mathrm{~V~}
$$

(b) The energy in the capacitor is

$$
w_{C} = \frac{1}{2} C\nu_{C}^{2} = \frac{1}{2} (1)(10^{2}) = 50\mathrm{~J~}
$$

and that in the inductor is

$$
w_{L} = \frac{1}{2} L i_{L}^{2} = \frac{1}{2} (2)(2^{2}) = 4\mathrm{~J~}
$$

Determine  $\nu_{C}$ ,  $i_{L}$ , and the energy stored in the capacitor and inductor in the circuit of Fig. 6.28 under dc conditions.

Answer: 15 V, 7.5 A, 450 J, 168.75 J.

# 6.5 Series and Parallel Inductors

Now that the inductor has been added to our list of passive elements, it is necessary to extend the powerful tool of series- parallel combination. We need to know how to find the equivalent inductance of a series- connected or parallel- connected set of inductors found in practical circuits.

Consider a series connection of  $N$  inductors, as shown in Fig. 6.29(a), with the equivalent circuit shown in Fig. 6.29(b). The inductors have the same current through them. Applying KVL to the loop,

$$
\nu = \nu_{1} + \nu_{2} + \nu_{3} + \dots +\nu_{N} \tag{6.25}
$$

Substituting  $\nu_{k} = L_{k}d i / d t$  results in

$$
\begin{array}{l}{{\nu=L_{1}\frac{d i}{d t}+L_{2}\frac{d i}{d t}+L_{3}\frac{d i}{d t}+\cdots+L_{N}\frac{d i}{d t}}}\\ {{=(L_{1}+L_{2}+L_{3}+\cdots+L_{N})\frac{d i}{d t}}}\\ {{=\Big(\sum_{k=1}^{N}L_{k}\Big)\frac{d i}{d t}=L_{\mathrm{eq}}\frac{d i}{d t}}}\end{array} \tag{6.26}
$$

where

$$
L_{eq} = L_{1} + L_{2} + L_{3} + \dots +L_{N} \tag{6.27}
$$

Thus,

The equivalent inductance of series- connected inductors is the sum of the individual inductances.

Inductors in series are combined in exactly the same way as resistors in series.

We now consider a parallel connection of  $N$  inductors, as shown in Fig. 6.30(a), with the equivalent circuit in Fig. 6.30(b). The inductors have the same voltage across them. Using KCL,

$$
i = i_{1} + i_{2} + i_{3} + \dots +i_{N} \tag{6.28}
$$

But  $i_{k} = \frac{1}{L_{k}} \int_{t_{0}}^{t} \nu dt + i_{k}(t_{0})$ ; hence,

$$
\begin{array}{r l} & {i = \frac{1}{L_{1}}\int_{t_{0}}^{t}\nu d t + i_{1}(t_{0}) + \frac{1}{L_{2}}\int_{t_{0}}^{t}\nu d t + i_{2}(t_{0})}\\ & {\qquad +\dots +\frac{1}{L_{N}}\int_{t_{0}}^{t}\nu d t + i_{N}(t_{0})}\\ & {= \Big(\frac{1}{L_{1}} +\frac{1}{L_{2}} +\dots +\frac{1}{L_{N}}\Big)\int_{t_{0}}^{t}\nu d t + i_{1}(t_{0}) + i_{2}(t_{0})}\\ & {\qquad +\dots +i_{N}(t_{0})}\\ & {= \Big(\sum_{k = 1}^{N}\frac{1}{L_{k}}\Big)\int_{t_{0}}^{t}\nu d t + \sum_{k = 1}^{N}i_{k}(t_{0}) = \frac{1}{L_{\mathrm{eq}}}\int_{t_{0}}^{t}\nu d t + i(t_{0})} \end{array}
$$

where

$$
\frac{1}{L_{\mathrm{eq}}} = \frac{1}{L_{1}} +\frac{1}{L_{2}} +\frac{1}{L_{3}} +\dots +\frac{1}{L_{N}} \tag{6.30}
$$

The initial current  $i(t_{0})$  through  $L_{\mathrm{eq}}$  at  $t = t_{0}$  is expected by KCL to be the sum of the inductor currents at  $t_{0}$ . Thus, according to Eq. (6.29),

$$
i(t_{0}) = i_{1}(t_{0}) + i_{2}(t_{0}) + \dots +i_{N}(t_{0})
$$

According to Eq. (6.30),

The equivalent inductance of parallel inductors is the reciprocal of the sum of the reciprocals of the individual inductances.

Note that the inductors in parallel are combined in the same way as resistors in parallel.

For two inductors in parallel  $(N = 2)$ , Eq. (6.30) becomes

$$
\frac{1}{L_{\mathrm{eq}}} = \frac{1}{L_{1}} +\frac{1}{L_{2}} \qquad \text{or} \qquad L_{\mathrm{eq}} = \frac{L_{1}L_{2}}{L_{1} + L_{2}} \tag{6.31}
$$

As long as all the elements are of the same type, the  $\Delta Y$  transformations for resistors discussed in Section 2.7 can be extended to capacitors and inductors.

Figure 6.31 For Example 6.11.

Find the equivalent inductance of the circuit shown in Fig. 6.31.

# Solution:

The 10- H, 12- H, and 20- H inductors are in series; thus, combining them gives a 42- H inductance. This 42- H inductor is in parallel with the 7- H inductor so that they are combined, to give

$$
\frac{7 \times 42}{7 + 42} = 6 \mathrm{H}
$$

This 6- H inductor is in series with the 4- H and 8- H inductors. Hence,

$$
L_{\mathrm{eq}} = 4 + 6 + 8 = 18 \mathrm{H}
$$

Figure 6.32 For Practice Prob. 6.11.

Answer: 25 mH.

For the circuit in Fig. 6.33,  $i(t) = 4(2 - e^{- 10t})$  mA. If  $i_{2}(0) = - 1$  mA, find: (a)  $i_{1}(0)$ ; (b)  $\nu (t)$ ,  $\nu_{1}(t)$ , and  $\nu_{2}(t)$ ; (c)  $i_{1}(t)$  and  $i_{2}(t)$ .

# Solution:

(a) From  $i(t) = 4(2 - e^{-10t})$  mA,  $i(0) = 4(2 - 1) = 4$  mA. Since  $i = i_{1} + i_{2}$ ,

$$
i_{1}(0) = i(0) - i_{2}(0) = 4 - (-1) = 5 \mathrm{mA}
$$

(b) The equivalent inductance is

$$
L_{\mathrm{eq}} = 2 + 4\parallel 12 = 2 + 3 = 5\mathrm{H}
$$

Thus,

$$
\nu (t) = L_{\mathrm{eq}} \frac{di}{dt} = 5(4)(-1)(-10) e^{-10t} \mathrm{mV} = 200 e^{-10t} \mathrm{mV}
$$

and

$$
\nu_{1}(t) = 2 \frac{di}{dt} = 2(-4)(-10) e^{-10t} \mathrm{mV} = 80 e^{-10t} \mathrm{mV}
$$

Since  $\nu = \nu_{1} + \nu_{2}$ ,

$$
\nu_{2}(t) = \nu (t) - \nu_{1}(t) = 120 e^{-10t} \mathrm{mV}
$$

(c) The current  $i_{1}$  is obtained as

$$
\begin{array}{l}{{i_{1}(t)=\frac{1}{4}\int_{0}^{t}\nu_{2}d t+i_{1}(0)=\frac{120}{4}\int_{0}^{t}e^{-10t}d t+5\mathrm{mA}}}\\ {{\mathrm{}}}\\ {{\mathrm{}=-3e^{-10t}\bigg|_{0}^{t}+5\mathrm{mA}=-3e^{-10t}+3+5=8-3e^{-10t}\mathrm{mA}}}\end{array}
$$

Similarly,

$$
\begin{array}{l}{{i_{2}(t)=\frac{1}{12}\int_{0}^{t}\nu_{2}d t+i_{2}(0)=\frac{120}{12}\int_{0}^{t}e^{-10t}d t-1\mathrm{mA}}}\\ {{\mathrm{}=-e^{-10t}\bigg|_{0}^{t}-1\mathrm{mA}=-e^{-10t}+1-1=-e^{-10t}\mathrm{mA}}}\end{array}
$$

Note that  $i_{1}(t) + i_{2}(t) = i(t)$ .

In the circuit of Fig. 6.34,  $i_{1}(t) = 600 e^{- 2t} \mathrm{mA}$ . If  $i(0) = 1.4$  A, find:

(a)  $i_{2}(0)$ ; 
(b)  $i_{2}(t)$  and  $i(t)$ ; 
(c)  $\nu_{1}(t)$ ,  $\nu_{2}(t)$ , and  $\nu (t)$ .

Answer: (a)  $800 \mathrm{mA}$ , (b)  $(- 0.4 + 1.2 e^{- 2t})$  A,  $(- 0.4 + 1.8 e^{- 2t})$  A, (c)  $- 36 e^{- 2t} \mathrm{V}$ ,  $- 7.2 e^{- 2t} \mathrm{V}$ ,  $- 28.8 e^{- 2t} \mathrm{V}$ .

# 6.6 Applications

Circuit elements such as resistors and capacitors are commercially available in either discrete form or integrated- circuit (IC) form. Unlike capacitors and resistors, inductors with appreciable inductance are difficult to produce on IC substrates. Therefore, inductors (coils) usually

come in discrete form and tend to be more bulky and expensive. For this reason, inductors are not as versatile as capacitors and resistors, and they are more limited in applications. However, there are several applications in which inductors have no practical substitute. They are routinely used in relays, delays, sensing devices, pick- up heads, telephone circuits, radio and TV receivers, power supplies, electric motors, microphones, and loudspeakers, to mention a few.

Capacitors and inductors possess the following three special properties that make them very useful in electric circuits:

1. The capacity to store energy makes them useful as temporary voltage or current sources. Thus, they can be used for generating a large amount of current or voltage for a short period of time. 
2. Capacitors oppose any abrupt change in voltage, while inductors oppose any abrupt change in current. This property makes inductors useful for spark or arc suppression and for converting pulsating dc voltage into relatively smooth dc voltage. 
3. Capacitors and inductors are frequency sensitive. This property makes them useful for frequency discrimination.

The first two properties are put to use in dc circuits, while the third one is taken advantage of in ac circuits. We will see how useful these properties are in later chapters. For now, consider three applications involving capacitors and op amps: integrator, differentiator, and analog computer.

# 6.6.1 Integrator

Important op amp circuits that use energy- storage elements include integrators and differentiators. These op amp circuits often involve resistors and capacitors; inductors (coils) tend to be more bulky and expensive.

The op amp integrator is used in numerous applications, especially in analog computers, to be discussed in Section 6.6.3.

An integrator is an op amp circuit whose output is proportional to the integral of the input signal.

If the feedback resistor  $R_{f}$  in the familiar inverting amplifier of Fig. 6.35(a) is replaced by a capacitor, we obtain an ideal integrator, as shown in Fig. 6.35(b). It is interesting that we can obtain a mathematical representation of integration this way. At node  $a$  in Fig. 6.35(b),

$$
i_{R} = i_{C} \tag{6.32}
$$

But

$$
i_{R} = \frac{\nu_{i}}{R},\qquad i_{C} = -C\frac{d\nu_{o}}{dt}
$$

Substituting these in Eq. (6.32), we obtain

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-13/c95faf42-d8e0-4f06-a665-945fc5e108f1/b42a979d478ea43d339c01921467a6e17a1226cb520d16c1db7f439c97f9ee25.jpg)  
Figure 6.35Replacing the feedback resistor in the inverting amplifier in (a) produces an integrator in (b).

$$
\frac{\nu_{i}}{R} = -C\frac{d\nu_{o}}{dt} \tag{6.33a}
$$

$$
d\nu_{o} = -\frac{1}{RC}\nu_{i}dt \tag{6.33b}
$$

Integrating both sides gives

$$
\nu_{o}(t) - \nu_{o}(0) = -\frac{1}{R C}\int_{0}^{t}\nu_{i}(\tau) d\tau \tag{6.34}
$$

To ensure that  $\nu_{o}(0) = 0$ , it is always necessary to discharge the integrator's capacitor prior to the application of a signal. Assuming  $\nu_{o}(0) = 0$ ,

$$
\boxed{\nu_{o} = -\frac{1}{R C}\int_{0}^{t}\nu_{i}(\tau) d\tau} \tag{6.35}
$$

which shows that the circuit in Fig. 6.35(b) provides an output voltage proportional to the integral of the input. In practice, the op amp integrator requires a feedback resistor to reduce dc gain and prevent saturation. Care must be taken that the op amp operates within the linear range so that it does not saturate.

If  $\nu_{1} = 10$  cos  $2t \mathrm{mV}$  and  $\nu_{2} = 0.5t \mathrm{mV}$ , find  $\nu_{o}$  in the op amp circuit in Fig. 6.36. Assume that the voltage across the capacitor is initially zero.

# Solution:

This is a summing integrator, and

$$
\begin{array}{l}{{\nu_{o}=-\frac{1}{R_{1}C}\int\nu_{1}d t-\frac{1}{R_{2}C}\int\nu_{2}d t}}\\ {{=-\frac{1}{3\times10^{6}\times2\times10^{-6}}\int_{0}^{t}10\cos{(2\tau)}d\tau}}\\ {{-\frac{1}{100\times10^{3}\times2\times10^{-6}}\int_{0}^{t}0.5\tau d\tau}}\\ {{=-\frac{1}{6}\frac{10}{2}\sin{2t}-\frac{1}{0.2}\frac{0.5t^{2}}{2}=-0.833\sin{2t}-1.25t^{2}\mathrm{mV}}}\end{array}
$$

Figure 6.36 For Example 6.13.

The integrator in Fig. 6.35(b) has  $R = 100 \mathrm{k}\Omega$ ,  $C = 20 \mu \mathrm{F}$ . Determine the output voltage when a dc voltage of  $2.5 \mathrm{mV}$  is applied at  $t = 0$ . Assume that the op amp is initially nulled.

Answer:  $- 1.25t \mathrm{mV}$ .

# 6.6.2 Differentiator

A differentiator is an op amp circuit whose output is proportional to the rate of change of the input signal.

In Fig. 6.35(a), if the input resistor is replaced by a capacitor, the resulting circuit is a differentiator, shown in Fig. 6.37. Applying KCL at node  $a$ ,

$$
i_{R} = i_{C} \tag{6.36}
$$

But

$$
i_{R} = -\frac{\nu_{o}}{R},\qquad i_{C} = C\frac{d\nu_{i}}{dt}
$$

Substituting these in Eq. (6.36) yields

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-13/c95faf42-d8e0-4f06-a665-945fc5e108f1/8cabcfe8af5a67f1a4cbfc6856707f15ac481e43bbd3d21e353a99747b47080f.jpg)  
Figure 6.37 An op amp differentiator.

$$
\nu_{o} = -RC\frac{d\nu_{i}}{dt} \tag{6.37}
$$

showing that the output is the derivative of the input. Differentiator circuits are electronically unstable because any electrical noise within the circuit is exaggerated by the differentiator. For this reason, the differentiator circuit in Fig. 6.37 is not as useful and popular as the integrator. It is seldom used in practice.

# Example 6.14

Sketch the output voltage for the circuit in Fig. 6.38(a), given the input voltage in Fig. 6.38(b). Take  $\nu_{o} = 0$  at  $t = 0$ .

# Solution:

This is a differentiator with

$$
R C = 5\times 10^{3}\times 0.2\times 10^{-6} = 10^{-3}\mathrm{s}
$$

For  $0< t< 4$  ms, we can express the input voltage in Fig. 6.38(b) as

$$
\nu_{i} = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}2000t & 0< t< 2\mathrm{ms}\\ 8 - 2000t & 2< t< 4\mathrm{ms} \end{array} \right.
$$

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-13/c95faf42-d8e0-4f06-a665-945fc5e108f1/c61c4015d23a0b7c61ff8fcd75a7c788de351c34a36b9e6369eba1861bac9a65.jpg)  
Figure 6.38 For Example 6.14.

This is repeated for  $4< t< 8$  ms. Using Eq. (6.37), the output is obtained as

$$
\nu_{o} = -RC\frac{d\nu_{i}}{dt} = \left\{ \begin{array}{cc} - 2\mathrm{V} & 0< t< 2\mathrm{ms}\\ 2\mathrm{V} & 2< t< 4\mathrm{ms} \end{array} \right.

# 6.6.3 Analog Computer

Op amps were initially developed for electronic analog computers. Analog computers can be programmed to solve mathematical models of mechanical or electrical systems. These models are usually expressed in terms of differential equations.

To solve simple differential equations using the analog computer requires cascading three types of op amp circuits: integrator circuits, summing amplifiers, and inverting/noninverting amplifiers for negative/ positive scaling. The best way to illustrate how an analog computer solves a differential equation is with an example.

Suppose we desire the solution  $x(t)$  of the equation

$$
a\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} +b\frac{dx}{dt} +cx = f(t),\qquad t > 0 \tag{6.38}
$$

where  $a,b$  ,and  $c$  are constants, and  $f(t)$  is an arbitrary forcing function. The solution is obtained by first solving the highest- order derivative term. Solving for  $d^{2}x / d t^{2}$  yields

$$
\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = \frac{f(t)}{a} -\frac{b}{a}\frac{dx}{dt} -\frac{c}{a} x \tag{6.39}
$$

To obtain  $d x / d t$  ,the  $d^{2}x / d t^{2}$  term is integrated and inverted. Finally, to obtain  $x$  ,the  $d x / d t$  term is integrated and inverted. The forcing function is injected at the proper point. Thus, the analog computer for solving Eq. (6.38) is implemented by connecting the necessary summers, inverters, and integrators. A plotter or oscilloscope may be used to view the output  $x$  ,or  $d x / d t$  ,or  $d^{2}x / d t^{2}$  , depending on where it is connected in the system.

Although the above example is on a second- order differential equation, any differential equation can be simulated by an analog computer comprising integrators, inverters, and inverting summers. But care must be exercised in selecting the values of the resistors and capacitors, to ensure that the op amps do not saturate during the solution time interval.

The analog computers with vacuum tubes were built in the 1950s and 1960s. Recently their use has declined. They have been superseded by modern digital computers. However, we still study analog computers for two reasons. First, the availability of integrated op amps has made it possible to build analog computers easily and cheaply. Second, understanding analog computers helps with the appreciation of the digital computers.

Design an analog computer circuit to solve the differential equation:

$$
\frac{d^2\nu_o}{dt^2} +2\frac{d\nu_o}{dt} +\nu_o = 10\sin 4t,\qquad t > 0
$$

subject to  $\nu_{o}(0) = - 4$ $\nu_{o}^{\prime}(0) = 1$  , where the prime refers to the time derivative.

# Solution:

1. Define. We have a clearly defined problem and expected solution. I might remind the student that many times the problem is not so well defined and this portion of the problem-solving process could

require much more effort. If this is so, then you should always keep in mind that time spent here will result in much less effort later and most likely save you a lot of frustration in the process.

2. Present. Clearly, using the devices developed in Section 6.6.3 will allow us to create the desired analog computer circuit. We will need the integrator circuits (possibly combined with a summing capability) and one or more inverter circuits.

3. Alternative. The approach for solving this problem is straightforward. We will need to pick the correct values of resistances and capacitors to allow us to realize the equation we are representing. The final output of the circuit will give the desired result.

4. Attempt. There are an infinite number of possibilities for picking the resistors and capacitors, many of which will result in correct solutions. Extreme values of resistors and capacitors will result in incorrect outputs. For example, low values of resistors will overload the electronics. Picking values of resistors that are too large will cause the op amps to stop functioning as ideal devices. The limits can be determined from the characteristics of the real op amp.

We first solve for the second derivative as

$$
\frac{d^2\nu_o}{dt^2} = 10\sin 4t - 2\frac{d\nu_o}{dt} -\nu_o \tag{6.15.1}
$$

Solving this requires some mathematical operations, including summing, scaling, and integration. Integrating both sides of Eq. (6.15.1) gives

$$
\frac{d\nu_o}{dt} = -\int_0t\left(-10\sin (4\tau) + 2\frac{d\nu_o(\tau)}{d\tau} +\nu_o(\tau)\right)dt + \nu_o'(0) \tag{6.15.2}
$$

where  $\nu_{o}^{\prime}(0) = 1$ . We implement Eq. (6.15.2) using the summing integrator shown in Fig. 6.40(a). The values of the resistors and capacitors have been chosen so that  $RC = 1$  for the term

$$
-\frac{1}{RC}\int_{0}^{t}\nu_{o}(\tau) d\tau
$$

Other terms in the summing integrator of Eq. (6.15.2) are implemented accordingly. The initial condition  $d\nu_{o}(0) / dt = 1$  is implemented by connecting a 1- V battery with a switch across the capacitor as shown in Fig. 6.40(a).

The next step is to obtain  $\nu_{o}$  by integrating  $d\nu_{o} / dt$  and inverting the result,

$$
\nu_{o} = -\int_{0}^{t} - \frac{d\nu_{o}(\tau)}{d\tau} d\tau +\nu (0) \tag{6.15.3}
$$

This is implemented with the circuit in Fig. 6.40(b) with the battery giving the initial condition of  $- 4\mathrm{V}$ . We now combine the two circuits in Fig. 6.40(a) and (b) to obtain the complete circuit shown in Fig. 6.40(c). When the input signal  $10\sin 4t$  is applied, we open the switches at  $t = 0$  to obtain the output waveform  $\nu_{o}$ , which may be viewed on an oscilloscope.

Figure 6.40 For Example 6.15.

5. Evaluate. The answer looks correct, but is it? If an actual solution for  $\nu_{o}$  is desired, then a good check would be to first find the solution by realizing the circuit in PSpice. This result could then be compared with a solution using the differential solution capability of MATLAB.

Since all we need to do is check the circuit and confirm that it represents the equation, we have an easier technique to use. We just go through the circuit and see if it generates the desired equation.

However, we still have choices to make. We could go through the circuit from left to right but that would involve differentiating the result to obtain the original equation. An easier approach would be to go from right to left. This is the approach we will use to check the answer.

Starting with the output,  $\nu_{o}$ , we see that the right- hand op amp is nothing more than an inverter with a gain of one. This means that the output of the middle circuit is  $- \nu_{o}$ . The following represents the action of the middle circuit.

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{-\nu_{o}=-\left(\int_{0}^{t}\frac{d\nu_{o}}{d\tau}d\tau+\nu_{o}(0)\right)=-\left(\nu_{o}\int_{0}^{t}+\nu_{o}(0)\right)}}\\ {{{}}}\\ {{=-(\nu_{o}(t)-\nu_{o}(0)+\nu_{o}(0))}}\end{array}
$$

where  $\nu_{o}(0) = - 4\mathrm{V}$  is the initial voltage across the capacitor.

We check the circuit on the left the same way.

$$
\frac{d\nu_{o}}{dt} = -\left(\int_{0}^{t} - \frac{d^{2}\nu_{o}}{d\tau^{2}} d\tau -\nu_{o}^{\prime}(0)\right) = -\left(-\frac{d\nu_{o}}{d\tau} +\nu_{o}^{\prime}(0) - \nu_{o}^{\prime}(0)\right)
$$

Now, all we need to verify is that the input to the first op amp is  $- d^{2}\nu_{o} / d t^{2}$ .

Looking at the input we see that it is equal to

$$
-10\sin (4t) + \nu_{o} + \frac{1 / 10^{-6}}{0.5\mathrm{M}\Omega}\frac{d\nu_{o}}{d t} = -10\sin (4t) + \nu_{o} + 2\frac{d\nu_{o}}{d t}
$$

which does produce  $- d^{2}\nu_{o} / d t^{2}$  from the original equation.

6. Satisfactory? The solution we have obtained is satisfactory. We can now present this work as a solution to the problem.

# Practice Problem 6.15

Design an analog computer circuit to solve the differential equation:

$$
\frac{d^{2}\nu_{o}}{d t^{2}} +3\frac{d\nu_{o}}{d t} +2\nu_{o} = 4\cos 10t,\qquad t > 0
$$

subject to  $\nu_{o}(0) = 2$ ,  $\nu_{o}^{\prime}(0) = 0$ .

Answer: See Fig. 6.41, where  $R C = 1\mathrm{~s~}$ .

# 6.7 Summary

1. The current through a capacitor is directly proportional to the time rate of change of the voltage across it.

$$
i = C\frac{d\nu}{d t}
$$

The current through a capacitor is zero unless the voltage is changing. Thus, a capacitor acts like an open circuit to a dc source.

2. The voltage across a capacitor is directly proportional to the time integral of the current through it.

$$
\nu = \frac{1}{C}\int_{-\infty}^{t}i d\tau = \frac{1}{C}\int_{t_0}^{t}i d\tau +\nu (t_0)
$$

The voltage across a capacitor cannot change instantly.

3. Capacitors in series and in parallel are combined in the same way as conductances.

4. The voltage across an inductor is directly proportional to the time rate of change of the current through it.

$$
\nu = L\frac{di}{dt}
$$

The voltage across the inductor is zero unless the current is changing. Thus, an inductor acts like a short circuit to a dc source.

5. The current through an inductor is directly proportional to the time integral of the voltage across it.

$$
i = \frac{1}{L}\int_{-\infty}^{t}\nu d\tau = \frac{1}{L}\int_{t_0}^{t}\nu d\tau +i(t_0)
$$

The current through an inductor cannot change instantly.

6. Inductors in series and in parallel are combined in the same way resistors in series and in parallel are combined.

7. At any given time  $t$ , the energy stored in a capacitor is  $\frac{1}{2} C\nu^2$ , while the energy stored in an inductor is  $\frac{1}{2} L t^2$ .

8. Three application circuits, the integrator, the differentiator, and the analog computer, can be realized using resistors, capacitors, and op amps.

# Enhancing Your Career

# Careers in Computer Engineering

Electrical engineering education has gone through drastic changes in recent decades. Most departments have come to be known as Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, emphasizing the rapid changes due to computers. Computers occupy a prominent place in modern society and education. They have become commonplace and are helping to change the face of research, development, production, business, and entertainment. The scientist, engineer, doctor, attorney, teacher, airline pilot, businessperson—almost anyone benefits from a computer's abilities to store large amounts of information and to process that information in very short periods of time. The internet, a computer communication network, is essential in business, education, and library science. Computer usage continues to grow by leaps and bounds.

An education in computer engineering should provide breadth in software, hardware design, and basic modeling techniques. It should include courses in data structures, digital systems, computer architecture, microprocessors, interfacing, software engineering, and operating systems.

Electrical engineers who specialize in computer engineering find jobs in computer industries and in numerous fields where computers are being used. Companies that produce software are growing rapidly in number and size and providing employment for those who are skilled in programming. An excellent way to advance one's knowledge of computers is to join the IEEE Computer Society, which sponsors diverse magazines, journals, and conferences.

# 7.1 Introduction

Now that we have considered the three passive elements (resistors, capacitors, and inductors) and one active element (the op amp) individually, we are prepared to consider circuits that contain various combinations of two or three of the passive elements. In this chapter, we shall examine two types of simple circuits: a circuit comprising a resistor and capacitor and a circuit comprising a resistor and an inductor. These are called  $RC$  and  $RL$  circuits, respectively. As simple as these circuits are, they find continual applications in electronics, communications, and control systems, as we shall see.

We carry out the analysis of  $RC$  and  $RL$  circuits by applying Kirchhoff's laws, as we did for resistive circuits. The only difference is that applying Kirchhoff's laws to purely resistive circuits results in algebraic equations, while applying the laws to  $RC$  and  $RL$  circuits produces differential equations, which are more difficult to solve than algebraic equations. The differential equations resulting from analyzing  $RC$  and  $RL$  circuits are of the first order. Hence, the circuits are collectively known as first- order circuits.

A first- order circuit is characterized by a first- order differential equation.

In addition to there being two types of first- order circuits ( $RC$  and  $RL$ ), there are two ways to excite the circuits. The first way is by initial conditions of the storage elements in the circuits. In these so- called source- free circuits, we assume that energy is initially stored in the capacitive or inductive element. The energy causes current to flow in the circuit and is gradually dissipated in the resistors. Although source- free circuits are by definition free of independent sources, they may have dependent sources. The second way of exciting first- order circuits is by independent sources. In this chapter, the independent sources we will consider are dc sources. (In later chapters, we shall consider sinusoidal and exponential sources.) The two types of first- order circuits and the two ways of exciting them add up to the four possible situations we will study in this chapter.

Finally, we consider four typical applications of  $RC$  and  $RL$  circuits: delay and relay circuits, a photoflash unit, and an automobile ignition circuit.

# 7.2 The Source-Free RC Circuit

A source- free  $RC$  circuit occurs when its dc source is suddenly disconnected. The energy already stored in the capacitor is released to the resistors.

Consider a series combination of a resistor and an initially charged capacitor, as shown in Fig. 7.1. (The resistor and capacitor may be the equivalent resistance and equivalent capacitance of combinations of resistors and capacitors.) Our objective is to determine the circuit response, which, for pedagogic reasons, we assume to be the voltage  $\nu (t)$  across the capacitor. Since the capacitor is initially charged, we can assume that at time  $t = 0$ , the initial voltage is

$$
\nu (0) = V_{0} \tag{7.1}
$$

with the corresponding value of the energy stored as

$$
w(0) = \frac{1}{2} CV_0^2 \tag{7.2}
$$

Applying KCL at the top node of the circuit in Fig. 7.1 yields

$$
i_{C} + i_{R} = 0 \tag{7.3}
$$

By definition,  $i_{C} = Cdv / dt$  and  $i_{R} = \nu /R$ . Thus,

$$
C\frac{d\nu}{dt} +\frac{\nu}{R} = 0 \tag{7.4a}
$$

or

$$
\frac{d\nu}{dt} +\frac{\nu}{RC} = 0 \tag{7.4b}
$$

This is a first- order differential equation, since only the first derivative of  $\nu$  is involved. To solve it, we rearrange the terms as

$$
\frac{d\nu}{\nu} = -\frac{1}{RC} dt \tag{7.5}
$$

Integrating both sides, we get

$$
\ln \nu = -\frac{t}{RC} +\ln A
$$

where  $\ln A$  is the integration constant. Thus,

$$
\ln {\frac{\nu}{A}} = -\frac{t}{RC} \tag{7.6}
$$

Taking powers of  $e$  produces

$$
\nu (t) = Ae^{-t / RC}
$$

But from the initial conditions,  $\nu (0) = A = V_{0}$ . Hence,

$$
\nu (t) = V_{0}e^{-t / RC} \tag{7.7}
$$

This shows that the voltage response of the  $RC$  circuit is an exponential decay of the initial voltage. Since the response is due to the initial energy stored and the physical characteristics of the circuit and not due to some external voltage or current source, it is called the natural response of the circuit.

Figure 7.1 A source-free  $RC$  circuit.

A circuit response is the manner in which the circuit reacts to an excitation.

The natural response depends on the nature of the circuit alone, with no external sources. In fact, the circuit has a response only because of the energy initially stored in the capacitor.

Figure 7.3 Graphical determination of the time constant  $\tau$  from the response curve.

The natural response of a circuit refers to the behavior (in terms of voltages and currents) of the circuit itself, with no external sources of excitation.

The natural response is illustrated graphically in Fig. 7.2. Note that at  $t = 0$ , we have the correct initial condition as in Eq. (7.1). As  $t$  increases, the voltage decreases toward zero. The rapidity with which the voltage decreases is expressed in terms of the time constant, denoted by  $\tau$ , the lowercase Greek letter tau.

The time constant of a circuit is the time required for the response to decay to a factor of  $1 / e$  or 36.8 percent of its initial value.

This implies that at  $t = \tau$ , Eq. (7.7) becomes

$$
V_{0}e^{-\tau /RC} = V_{0}e^{-1} = 0.368V_{0}
$$

or

$$
\tau = RC
$$

In terms of the time constant, Eq. (7.7) can be written as

$$
\nu (t) = V_{0}e^{-t / \tau}
$$

With a calculator it is easy to show that the value of  $\nu (t) / V_{0}$  is as shown in Table 7.1. It is evident from Table 7.1 that the voltage  $\nu (t)$  is less than 1 percent of  $V_{0}$  after  $5\tau$  (five time constants). Thus, it is customary to assume that the capacitor is fully discharged (or charged) after five time constants. In other words, it takes  $5\tau$  for the circuit to reach its final state or steady state when no changes take place with time. Notice that for every time interval of  $\tau$ , the voltage is reduced by 36.8 percent of its previous value,  $\nu (t + \tau) = \nu (t) / e = 0.368\nu (t)$ , regardless of the value of  $t$ .

Observe from Eq. (7.8) that the smaller the time constant, the more rapidly the voltage decreases, that is, the faster the response. This is illustrated in Fig. 7.4. A circuit with a small time constant gives a fast response in that it reaches the steady state (or final state) quickly due to quick dissipation of energy stored, whereas a circuit with a large time constant gives a slow response because it takes longer to reach steady state. At any rate, whether the time constant is small or large, the circuit reaches steady state in five time constants.

With the voltage  $\nu (t)$  in Eq. (7.9), we can find the current  $i_{R}(t)$

$$
i_{R}(t) = \frac{\nu(t)}{R} = \frac{V_{0}}{R} e^{-t / \tau}
$$

1 The time constant may be viewed from another perspective. Evaluating the derivative of  $\nu (t)$  in Eq. (7.7) at  $t = 0$ , we obtain

$$
\frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{\nu}{V_0}\right)\bigg|_{t = 0} = -\frac{1}{\tau} e^{-t / \tau}\bigg|_{t = 0} = -\frac{1}{\tau}
$$

Thus, the time constant is the initial rate of decay, or the time taken for  $\nu /V_{0}$  to decay from unity to zero, assuming a constant rate of decay. This initial slope interpretation of the time constant is often used in the laboratory to find  $\tau$  graphically from the response curve displayed on an oscilloscope. To find  $\tau$  from the response curve, draw the tangent to the curve at  $t = 0$ , as shown in Fig. 7.3. The tangent intercepts with the time axis at  $t = \tau$ .

Figure 7.4

Plot of  $\nu /V_{0} = e^{- t / \tau}$  for various values of the time constant.

The power dissipated in the resistor is

$$
p(t) = \nu i_{R} = \frac{V_{0}^{2}}{R} e^{-2t / \tau} \tag{7.11}
$$

The energy absorbed by the resistor up to time  $t$  is

$$
\begin{array}{l}{{w_{R}(t)=\int_{0}^{t}p(\lambda)d\lambda=\int_{0}^{t}\frac{V_{0}^{2}}{R}e^{-2\lambda/\tau}d\lambda}}\\ {{\quad\quad=-\frac{\tau V_{0}^{2}}{2R}e^{-2\lambda/\tau}\Big|_{0}=\frac{1}{2}C V_{0}^{2}(1-e^{-2t/\tau}),\qquad\tau=RC}}\end{array} \tag{7.12}
$$

Notice that as  $t \to \infty$ ,  $w_{R}(\infty) \to \frac{1}{2} C V_{0}^{2}$ , which is the same as  $w_{C}(0)$ , the energy initially stored in the capacitor. The energy that was initially stored in the capacitor is eventually dissipated in the resistor.

In summary:

The Key to Working with a Source- Free RC Circuit Is Finding:

1. The initial voltage  $\nu (0) = V_{0}$  across the capacitor.

2. The time constant  $\tau$ .

With these two items, we obtain the response as the capacitor voltage  $\nu_{C}(t) = \nu (t) = \nu (0)e^{- t / \tau}$ . Once the capacitor voltage is first obtained, other variables (capacitor current  $i_{C}$ , resistor voltage  $\nu_{R}$ , and resistor current  $i_{R}$ ) can be determined. In finding the time constant  $\tau = RC$ ,  $R$  is often the Thevenin equivalent resistance at the terminals of the capacitor; that is, we take out the capacitor  $C$  and find  $R = R_{\mathrm{Th}}$  at its terminals.

The time constant is the same regardless of what the output is defined to be.

When a circuit contains a single capacitor and several resistors and dependent sources, the Thevenin equivalent can be found at the terminals of the capacitor to form a simple RC circuit. Also, one can use Thevenin's theorem when several capacitors can be combined to form a single equivalent capacitor.

In Fig. 7.5, let  $\nu_{C}(0) = 15 \mathrm{~V}$ . Find  $\nu_{C}$ ,  $\nu_{x}$ , and  $i_{x}$  for  $t > 0$ .

# Solution:

We first need to make the circuit in Fig. 7.5 conform with the standard  $RC$  circuit in Fig. 7.1. We find the equivalent resistance or the Thevenin

resistance at the capacitor terminals. Our objective is always to first obtain capacitor voltage  $\nu_{C}$ . From this, we can determine  $\nu_{x}$  and  $i_{x}$ .

The  $8 - \Omega$  and  $12 - \Omega$  resistors in series can be combined to give a  $20 - \Omega$  resistor. This  $20 - \Omega$  resistor in parallel with the  $5 - \Omega$  resistor can be combined so that the equivalent resistance is

$$
R_{\mathrm{eq}} = \frac{20\times 5}{20 + 5} = 4\Omega
$$

Hence, the equivalent circuit is as shown in Fig. 7.6, which is analogous to Fig. 7.1. The time constant is

$$
\tau = R_{\mathrm{eq}}C = 4(0.1) = 0.4\mathrm{~s~}
$$

Thus,

$$
\nu = \nu (0)e^{-t / \tau} = 15e^{-t / 0.4}\mathrm{~V},\qquad \nu_{C} = \nu = 15e^{-2.5t}\mathrm{~V}
$$

From Fig. 7.5, we can use voltage division to get  $\nu_{x}$ ; so

$$
\nu_{x} = \frac{12}{12 + 8}\nu = 0.6(15e^{-2.5t}) = 9e^{-2.5t}\mathrm{~V}
$$

Finally,

$$

The switch in the circuit in Fig. 7.8 has been closed for a long time, and it is opened at  $t = 0$ . Find  $\nu (t)$  for  $t \geq 0$ . Calculate the initial energy stored in the capacitor.

# Solution:

For  $t < 0$ , the switch is closed; the capacitor is an open circuit to dc, as represented in Fig. 7.9(a). Using voltage division

$$
\nu_{C}(t) = \frac{9}{9 + 3} (20) = 15\mathrm{~V},\qquad t < 0
$$

Since the voltage across a capacitor cannot change instantaneously, the voltage across the capacitor at  $t = 0^{- }$  is the same at  $t = 0$ , or

$$
\nu_{C}(0) = V_{0} = 15\mathrm{~V}
$$

For  $t > 0$ , the switch is opened, and we have the  $RC$  circuit shown in Fig. 7.9(b). [Notice that the  $RC$  circuit in Fig. 7.9(b) is source free; the independent source in Fig. 7.8 is needed to provide  $V_{0}$  or the initial energy in the capacitor.] The  $1 - \Omega$  and  $9 - \Omega$  resistors in series give

$$
R_{\mathrm{eq}} = 1 + 9 = 10 \Omega
$$

The time constant is

$$
\tau = R_{\mathrm{eq}} C = 10 \times 20 \times 10^{-3} = 0.2 \mathrm{~s}
$$

Thus, the voltage across the capacitor for  $t \geq 0$  is

$$
\nu (t) = \nu_{C}(0) e^{-t / 2} = 15 e^{-t / 0.2} \mathrm{~V}
$$

or

The initial energy stored in the capacitor is

i(0) = I_{0} \tag{7.13}
$$

with the corresponding energy stored in the inductor as

$$
w(0) = \frac{1}{2} L I_{0}^{2} \tag{7.14}
$$

Applying KVL around the loop in Fig. 7.11,

$$
\nu_{L} + \nu_{R} = 0 \tag{7.15}
$$

But  $\nu_{L} = L d i / d t$  and  $\nu_{R} = i R$ . Thus,

$$
L \frac{d i}{d t} + R i = 0
$$

Figure 7.12 The current response of the  $R L$  circuit.

This shows that the natural response of the  $R L$  circuit is an exponential decay of the initial current. The current response is shown in Fig. 7.12. It is evident from Eq. (7.18) that the time constant for the  $R L$  circuit is

$$
\tau = \frac{L}{R} \tag{7.19}
$$

with  $\tau$  again having the unit of seconds. Thus, Eq. (7.18) may be written as

$$
i(t) = I_{0}e^{-t / \tau} \tag{7.20}
$$

With the current in Eq. (7.20), we can find the voltage across the resistor as

$$
\nu_{R}(t) = i R = I_{0}R e^{-t / \tau} \tag{7.21}
$$

The smaller the time constant  $\tau$  of a circuit, the faster the rate of decay of the response. The larger the time constant, the slower the rate of decay of the response. At any rate, the response decays to less than 1 percent of its initial value (i.e., reaches steady state) after  $5 \tau$ .

The power dissipated in the resistor is

$$
p = \nu_{R}i = I_{0}^{2}R e^{-2t / \tau} \tag{7.22}
$$

The energy absorbed by the resistor is

$$
w_{R}(t) = \int_{0}^{t} p(\lambda) d\lambda = \int_{0}^{t} I_{0}^{2} R e^{-2 \lambda / \tau} d\lambda = -\frac{\tau}{2} I_{0}^{2} R e^{-2 \lambda / \tau} I_{0}^{t}, \qquad \tau = \frac{L}{R}
$$

or

$$
w_{R}(t) = \frac{1}{2} L I_{0}^{2}(1 - e^{-2t / \tau}) \tag{7.23}
$$

Figure 7.12 shows an initial slope interpretation may be given to  $\tau$ .

Note that as  $t \to \infty , w_{R}(\infty) \to \frac{1}{2} L I_{0}^{2}$ , which is the same as  $w_{L}(0)$ , the initial energy stored in the inductor as in Eq. (7.14). Again, the energy initially stored in the inductor is eventually dissipated in the resistor.

In summary:

# The Key to Working with a Source-Free RL Circuit Is to Find:

1. The initial current  $i(0) = I_{0}$  through the inductor. 
2. The time constant  $\tau$  of the circuit.

With the two items, we obtain the response as the inductor current  $i_{L}(t) = i(t) = i(0)\epsilon^{- t / \tau}$  . Once we determine the inductor current  $i_{L}$  , other variables (inductor voltage  $\nu_{L}$  , resistor voltage  $\nu_{R}$  , and resistor current  $i_{R}$  ) can be obtained. Note that in general,  $R$  in Eq. (7.19) is the Thevenin resistance at the terminals of the inductor.

When a circuit has a single inductor and several resistors and dependent sources, the Thevenin equivalent can be found at the terminals of the inductor to form a simple RL circuit. Also, one can use Thevenin's theorem when several inductors can be combined to form a single equivalent inductor.

Assuming that  $i(0) = 10$  A, calculate  $i(t)$  and  $i_{x}(t)$  in the circuit of Fig. 7.13.

# Solution:

There are two ways we can solve this problem. One way is to obtain the equivalent resistance at the inductor terminals and then use Eq. (7.20). The other way is to start from scratch by using Kirchhoff's voltage law. Whichever approach is taken, it is always better to first obtain the inductor current.

METHOD 1 The equivalent resistance is the same as the Thevenin resistance at the inductor terminals. Because of the dependent source, we insert a voltage source with  $\nu_{o} = 1$  V at the inductor terminals  $a$ -  $b$ , as in Fig. 7.14(a). (We could also insert a 1- A current source at the terminals.) Applying KVL to the two loops results in

$$

Substituting Eq. (7.3.2) into Eq. (7.3.1) gives

$$
i_{1} = -3\mathrm{A},\qquad i_{o} = -i_{1} = 3\mathrm{A}
$$

Hence,

$$
R_{\mathrm{eq}} = R_{\mathrm{Th}} = \frac{\nu_{o}}{i_{o}} = \frac{1}{3}\Omega
$$

The time constant is

$$
\tau = \frac{L}{R_{\mathrm{eq}}} = \frac{\frac{1}{2}}{\frac{1}{3}} = \frac{3}{2}\mathrm{s}
$$

Thus, the current through the inductor is

$$
i(t) = i(0)e^{-t / \tau} = 10e^{-(2 / 3)t}\mathrm{A},\qquad t > 0
$$

METHOD 2 We may directly apply KVL to the circuit as in Fig. 7.14(b). For loop 1,

$$
\frac{1}{2}\frac{d i_{1}}{d t} +2(i_{1} - i_{2}) = 0
$$

or

$$
\frac{d i_{1}}{d t} +4i_{1} - 4i_{2} = 0 \tag{7.3.3}
$$

For loop 2,

$$
6i_{2} - 2i_{1} - 3i_{1} = 0\qquad \Rightarrow \qquad i_{2} = \frac{5}{6} i_{1} \tag{7.3.4}
$$

Substituting Eq. (7.3.4) into Eq. (7.3.3) gives

$$
\frac{d i_{1}}{d t} +\frac{2}{3} i_{1} = 0
$$

Rearranging terms,

$$
\frac{d i_{1}}{i_{1}} = -\frac{2}{3} d t
$$

Since  $i_{1} = i$ , we may replace  $i_{1}$  with  $i$  and integrate:

$$
\ln i\bigg|_{i(0)}^{i(t)} = -\frac{2}{3} t\bigg|_{0}^{t}
$$

or

$$
\ln \frac{i(t)}{i(0)} = -\frac{2}{3} t
$$

Taking the powers of  $e$ , we finally obtain

$$
i(t) = i(0)e^{-(2 / 3)t} = 10e^{-(2 / 3)t}\mathrm{A},\qquad t > 0
$$

which is the same as by Method 1.

The voltage across the inductor is

$$
\nu = L\frac{d i}{d t} = 0.5(10)\bigg(\frac{2}{3}\bigg)e^{-(2 / 3)t} = -\frac{10}{3} e^{-(2 / 3)t}\mathrm{V}
$$

Since the inductor and the  $2 - \Omega$  resistor are in parallel,

$$
i_{2}(t) = \frac{\nu}{2} = -1.6667e^{-(2 / 3)t}\mathrm{A},\qquad t > 0
$$

Find  $i$  and  $\nu_{x}$  in the circuit of Fig. 7.15. Let  $i(0) = 12\mathrm{A}$ .

Answer:  $12e^{- 2t}\mathrm{A}, - 12e^{- 2t}\mathrm{V},t > 0.$

Figure 7.15 For Practice Prob. 7.3.

The switch in the circuit of Fig. 7.16 has been closed for a long time. At  $t = 0$ , the switch is opened. Calculate  $i(t)$  for  $t > 0$ .

# Solution:

When  $t< 0$ , the switch is closed, and the inductor acts as a short circuit to dc. The  $16 - \Omega$  resistor is short- circuited; the resulting circuit is shown in Fig. 7.17(a). To get  $i_{1}$  in Fig. 7.17(a), we combine the  $4 - \Omega$  and  $12 - \Omega$  resistors in parallel to get

$$
\frac{4\times12}{4 + 12} = 3\Omega
$$

Hence,

$$
i_{1} = \frac{40}{2 + 3} = 8\mathrm{A}
$$

We obtain  $i(t)$  from  $i_{1}$  in Fig. 7.17(a) using current division, by writing

$$
i(t) = \frac{12}{12 + 4} i_{1} = 6\mathrm{A},\qquad t< 0
$$

Since the current through an inductor cannot change instantaneously,

$$
i(0) = i(0^{-}) = 6\mathrm{A}
$$

When  $t > 0$ , the switch is open and the voltage source is disconnected. We now have the source- free  $RL$  circuit in Fig. 7.17(b). Combining the resistors, we have

$$
R_{\mathrm{eq}} = (12 + 4)\parallel 16 = 8\Omega
$$

The time constant is

Thus,

$$
\tau = \frac{L}{R_{\mathrm{eq}}} = \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4}\mathrm{s}
$$

$$
i(t) = i(0)e^{-t / \tau} = 6e^{-4t}\mathrm{A}
$$

Figure 7.20 The circuit in Fig. 7.19 for (a)  $t < 0$ , (b)  $t > 0$ .

Answer:  $5e^{- 2t}$  A,  $t > 0$ .

In the circuit shown in Fig. 7.19, find  $i_{o}$ ,  $\nu_{o}$ , and  $i$  for all time, assuming that the switch was open for a long time.

# Solution:

It is better to first find the inductor current  $i$  and then obtain other quantities from it.

For  $t < 0$ , the switch is open. Since the inductor acts like a short circuit to dc, the  $6 - \Omega$  resistor is short- circuited, so that we have the circuit shown in Fig. 7.20(a). Hence,  $i_{o} = 0$ , and

$$
\begin{array}{l l}{{i(t)=\frac{10}{2+3}=2\mathrm{A},}}&{{\quad t< 0}}\\ {{}}&{{}}\\ {{\nu_{o}(t)=3i(t)=6\mathrm{V},}}&{{\quad t< 0}}\end{array}
$$

Thus,  $i(0) = 2$

For  $t > 0$ , the switch is closed, so that the voltage source is short- circuited. We now have a source- free  $RL$  circuit as shown in Fig. 7.20(b). At the inductor terminals,

$$
R_{\mathrm{Th}} = 3\parallel 6 = 2\Omega
$$

so that the time constant is

$$
\tau = \frac{L}{R_{\mathrm{Th}}} = 1 \mathrm{s}
$$

Hence,

$$
i(t) = i(0) e^{-t / \tau} = 2 e^{-t} \mathrm{A}, \qquad t > 0
$$

Because the inductor is in parallel with the 6- and  $3 - \Omega$  resistors,

$$
\nu_{o}(t) = -\nu_{L} = -L \frac{di}{dt} = -2 (-2 e^{-t}) = 4 e^{-t} \mathrm{V}, \qquad t > 0
$$

and

$$
i_{o}(t) = \frac{\nu_{L}}{6} = -\frac{2}{3} e^{-t} \mathrm{A}, \qquad t > 0
$$

Thus, for all time,

$$
i_{o}(t) = \left\{ \begin{array}{l l}{0\mathrm{~A},} & {\quad t< 0}\\ {-\frac{2}{3} e^{-t}\mathrm{~A},} & {\quad t > 0} \end{array} \right.,\quad \nu_{o}(t) = \left\{ \begin{array}{l l}{6\mathrm{~V},} & {\quad t< 0}\\ {4e^{-t}\mathrm{~V},} & {\quad t > 0} \end{array} \right.
$$

We notice that the inductor current is continuous at  $t = 0$ , while the current through the  $6 - \Omega$  resistor drops from 0 to  $- 2 / 3$  at  $t = 0$ , and the voltage across the  $3 - \Omega$  resistor drops from 6 to 4 at  $t = 0$ . We also notice that the time constant is the same regardless of what the output is defined to be. Figure 7.21 plots  $i$  and  $i_{o}$ .

Figure 7.21 A plot of  $i$  and  $i_{o}$ .

Determine  $i$ ,  $i_{o}$ , and  $\nu_{o}$  for all  $t$  in the circuit shown in Fig. 7.22. Assume that the switch was closed for a long time. It should be noted that opening a switch in series with an ideal current source creates an infinite voltage at the current source terminals. Clearly this is impossible. For the purposes of problem solving, we can place a shunt resistor in parallel with the source (which now makes it a voltage source in series with a resistor). In more practical circuits, devices that act like current sources are, for the most part, electronic circuits. These circuits will allow the source to act like an ideal current source over its operating range but voltage- limit it when the load resistor becomes too large (as in an open circuit).

$$
i = \left\{ \begin{array}{l l}{16\mathrm{~A},} & {\quad t< 0}\\ {16e^{-2t}\mathrm{~A},} & {\quad t\geq 0} \end{array} \right.,\qquad i_{o} = \left\{ \begin{array}{l l}{8\mathrm{~A},} & {\quad t< 0}\\ {-5.333e^{-2t}\mathrm{~A},} & {\quad t > 0} \end{array} \right.,
$$

$$
\nu_{o} = \left\{ \begin{array}{l l}{32\mathrm{~V},} & {\quad t< 0}\\ {10.667e^{-2t}\mathrm{~V},} & {\quad t > 0} \end{array} \right.

# 7.4 Singularity Functions

Before going on with the second half of this chapter, we need to digress and consider some mathematical concepts that will aid our understanding of transient analysis. A basic understanding of singularity functions will help us make sense of the response of first- order circuits to a sudden application of an independent dc voltage or current source.

Singularity functions (also called switching functions) are very useful in circuit analysis. They serve as good approximations to the switching signals that arise in circuits with switching operations. They are helpful in the neat, compact description of some circuit phenomena, especially the step response of  $RC$  or  $RL$  circuits to be discussed in the next sections. By definition,

Singularity functions are functions that either are discontinuous or have discontinuous derivatives.

Figure 7.24 (a) The unit step function delayed by  $t_0$ , (b) the unit step advanced by  $t_0$ .

Alternatively, we may derive Eqs. (7.25) and (7.26) from Eq. (7.24) by writing  $u[f(t)] = 1$ ,  $f(t) = 0$ , where  $f(t)$  may be  $t - t_0$  or  $t + t_0$ .

The three most widely used singularity functions in circuit analysis are the unit step, the unit impulse, and the unit ramp functions.

The unit step function  $u(t)$  is  $0$  for negative values of  $t$  and  $1$  for positive values of  $t$ .

In mathematical terms,

$$
u(t) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}0, & t< 0 \\ 1, & t > 0 \end{array} \right. \tag{7.24}
$$

The unit step function is undefined at  $t = 0$ , where it changes abruptly from 0 to 1. It is dimensionless, like other mathematical functions such as sine and cosine. Figure 7.23 depicts the unit step function. If the abrupt change occurs at  $t = t_0$  (where  $t_0 > 0$ ) instead of  $t = 0$ , the unit step function becomes

$$
u(t - t_0) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}0, & t< t_0 \\ 1, & t > t_0 \end{array} \right. \tag{7.25}
$$

which is the same as saying that  $u(t)$  is delayed by  $t_0$  seconds, as shown in Fig. 7.24(a). To get Eq. (7.25) from Eq. (7.24), we simply replace every  $t$  by  $t - t_0$ . If the change is at  $t = - t_0$ , the unit step function becomes

$$
u(t + t_0) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}0, & t< -t_0 \\ 1, & t > - t_0 \end{array} \right. \tag{7.26}
$$

meaning that  $u(t)$  is advanced by  $t_0$  seconds, as shown in Fig. 7.24(b).

We use the step function to represent an abrupt change in voltage or current, like the changes that occur in the circuits of control systems and digital computers. For example, the voltage

$$
\nu (t) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}0, & t< t_0 \\ V_0, & t > t_0 \end{array} \right. \tag{7.27}
$$

may be expressed in terms of the unit step function as

$$
\nu (t) = V_0u(t - t_0) \tag{7.28}
$$

If we let  $t_0 = 0$ , then  $\nu (t)$  is simply the step voltage  $V_0u(t)$ . A voltage source of  $V_0u(t)$  is shown in Fig. 7.25(a); its equivalent circuit is shown in Fig. 7.25(b). It is evident in Fig. 7.25(b) that terminals  $a - b$  are short- circuited ( $\nu = 0$ ) for  $t< 0$  and that  $\nu = V_0$  appears at the terminals for

The derivative of the unit step function  $u(t)$  is the unit impulse function  $\delta (t)$ , which we write as

$$
\delta (t) = \frac{d}{dt} u(t) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}0, & t< 0\\ \mathrm{Undefined}, & t = 0\\ 0, & t > 0 \end{array} \right. \tag{7.29}
$$

The unit impulse function—also known as the delta function—is shown in Fig. 7.27.

The unit impulse function  $\delta (t)$  is zero everywhere except at  $t = 0$ , where it is undefined.

Impulsive currents and voltages occur in electric circuits as a result of switching operations or impulsive sources. Although the unit impulse function is not physically realizable (just like ideal sources, ideal resistors, etc.), it is a very useful mathematical tool.

The unit impulse may be regarded as an applied or resulting shock. It may be visualized as a very short duration pulse of unit area. This may be expressed mathematically as

$$
\int_{0^{-}}^{0^{+}}\delta (t)dt = 1 \tag{7.30}
$$

where  $t = 0^{- }$  denotes the time just before  $t = 0$  and  $t = 0^{+}$  is the time just after  $t = 0$ . For this reason, it is customary to write 1 (denoting unit area) beside the arrow that is used to symbolize the unit impulse function, as in Fig. 7.27. The unit area is known as the strength of the impulse function. When an impulse function has a strength other than unity, the area of the impulse is equal to its strength. For example, an impulse function  $10\delta (t)$  has an area of 10. Figure 7.28 shows the impulse functions  $5\delta (t + 2), 10\delta (t)$ , and  $- 4\delta (t - 3)$ .

To illustrate how the impulse function affects other functions, let us evaluate the integral

$$
\int_{a}^{b}f(t)\delta (t - t_{0})dt \tag{7.31}
$$

Figure 7.28 Three impulse functions.

where  $a< t_{0}< b$  . Since  $\delta (t - t_{0}) = 0$  except at  $t = t_{0}$  , the integrand is zero except at  $t_{0}$  . Thus,

$$
\begin{array}{l}{{\int_{a}^{b}f(t)\delta(t-t_{0})d t=\int_{a}^{b}f(t_{0})\delta(t-t_{0})d t}}\\ {{=f(t_{0})\int_{a}^{b}\delta(t-t_{0})d t=f(t_{0})}}\end{array}
$$

or

$$
\int_{a}^{b}f(t)\delta (t - t_{0})d t = f(t_{0}) \tag{7.32}
$$

This shows that when a function is integrated with the impulse function, we obtain the value of the function at the point where the impulse occurs. This is a highly useful property of the impulse function known as the sampling or sifting property. The special case of Eq. (7.31) is for  $t_{0} = 0$  Then Eq. (7.32) becomes

$$
\int_{0^{-}}^{0^{+}}f(t)\delta (t)d t = f(0) \tag{7.33}

Figure 7.30 The unit ramp function: (a) delayed by  $t_{0}$ , (b) advanced by  $t_{0}$ .

The unit ramp function is zero for negative values of  $t$  and has a unit slope for positive values of  $t$ .

Figure 7.29 shows the unit ramp function. In general, a ramp is a function that changes at a constant rate.

The unit ramp function may be delayed or advanced as shown in Fig. 7.30. For the delayed unit ramp function,

$$
r(t - t_{0}) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}0, & t \leq t_{0} \\ t - t_{0}, & t \geq t_{0} \end{array} \right. \tag{7.36}
$$

and for the advanced unit ramp function,

$$
r(t + t_{0}) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}0, & t \leq -t_{0} \\ t + t_{0}, & t \geq -t_{0} \end{array} \right. \tag{7.37}
$$

We should keep in mind that the three singularity functions (impulse, step, and ramp) are related by differentiation as

$$
\delta (t) = \frac{du(t)}{dt}, \qquad u(t) = \frac{dr(t)}{dt} \tag{7.38}
$$

or by integration as

$$
u(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{t}\delta (\lambda)d\lambda ,\quad r(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{t}u(\lambda)d\lambda . \tag{7.39}
$$

Although there are many more singularity functions, we are only interested in these three (the impulse function, the unit step function, and the ramp function) at this point.

Express the voltage pulse in Fig. 7.31 in terms of the unit step. Calculate its derivative and sketch it.

# Solution:

The type of pulse in Fig. 7.31 is called the gate function. It may be regarded as a step function that switches on at one value of  $t$  and switches off at another value of  $t$ . The gate function shown in Fig. 7.31 switches on at  $t = 2$  s and switches off at  $t = 5$  s. It consists of the sum of two unit step functions as shown in Fig. 7.32(a). From the figure, it is evident that

$$
\nu (t) = 10u(t - 2) - 10u(t - 5) = 10[u(t - 2) - u(t - 5)]
$$

Taking the derivative of this gives

$$
\frac{d\nu}{dt} = 10[\delta (t - 2) - \delta (t - 5)]
$$

which is shown in Fig. 7.32(b). We can obtain Fig. 7.32(b) directly from Fig. 7.31 by simply observing that there is a sudden increase by  $10 \mathrm{~V}$  at  $t = 2$  s leading to  $10\delta (t - 2)$ . At  $t = 5$  s, there is a sudden decrease by  $10 \mathrm{~V}$  leading to  $- 10\mathrm{V} \delta (t - 5)$ .

Gate functions are used along with switches to pass or block another signal.

# Example 7.7

Express the sawtooth function shown in Fig. 7.35 in terms of singularity functions.

# Solution:

There are three ways of solving this problem. The first method is by mere observation of the given function, while the other methods involve some graphical manipulations of the function.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-13/c95faf42-d8e0-4f06-a665-945fc5e108f1/502be90916a21009270232510d908a0fc202fc06dd1b16409d6f4f5bb50618e9.jpg)  
Figure 7.35 For Example 7.7.

METHOD 1 By looking at the sketch of  $\nu (t)$  in Fig. 7.35, it is not hard to notice that the given function  $\nu (t)$  is a combination of singularity functions. So we let

$$
\nu (t) = \nu_{1}(t) + \nu_{2}(t) + \dots \tag{7.7.1}
$$

The function  $\nu_{1}(t)$  is the ramp function of slope 5, shown in Fig. 7.36(a); that is,

$$
\nu_{1}(t) = 5r(t) \tag{7.7.2}
$$

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-13/c95faf42-d8e0-4f06-a665-945fc5e108f1/711b7c22ad86f77e1d960338ffe03880e7bf459b900e5e272c92b680fb85c148.jpg)  
Figure 7.36 Partial decomposition of  $\nu (t)$  in Fig. 7.35.

Since  $\nu_{1}(t)$  goes to infinity, we need another function at  $t = 2s$  in order to get  $\nu (t)$ . We let this function be  $\nu_{2}$ , which is a ramp function of slope  $- 5$ , as shown in Fig. 7.36(b); that is,

$$
\nu_{2}(t) = -5r(t - 2) \tag{7.7.3}
$$

Adding  $\nu_{1}$  and  $\nu_{2}$  gives us the signal in Fig. 7.36(c). Obviously, this is not the same as  $\nu (t)$  in Fig. 7.35. But the difference is simply a constant 10 units for  $t > 2$  s. By adding a third signal  $\nu_{3}$ , where

$$
\nu_{3} = -10u(t - 2) \tag{7.7.4}
$$

we get  $\nu (t)$ , as shown in Fig. 7.37. Substituting Eqs. (7.7.2) through (7.7.4) into Eq. (7.7.1) gives

$$
\nu (t) = 5r(t) - 5r(t - 2) - 10u(t - 2)
$$

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-13/c95faf42-d8e0-4f06-a665-945fc5e108f1/8b9e4202fac23255d6146f4c98dca93c6c54e3bd7ed3db1e95f6a5d857e49457.jpg)  
Figure 7.37 Complete decomposition of  $\nu (t)$  in Fig. 7.35.

METHOD 2 A close observation of Fig. 7.35 reveals that  $\nu (t)$  is a multiplication of two functions: a ramp function and a gate function. Thus,

$$
\begin{array}{r l} & {\nu (t) = 5t[u(t) - u(t - 2)]}\\ & {\qquad = 5t u(t) - 5t u(t - 2)}\\ & {\qquad = 5r(t) - 5(t - 2 + 2)u(t - 2)}\\ & {\qquad = 5r(t) - 5(t - 2)u(t - 2) - 10u(t - 2)}\\ & {\qquad = 5r(t) - 5r(t - 2) - 10u(t - 2)} \end{array}
$$

the same as before.

METHOD 3 This method is similar to Method 2. We observe from Fig. 7.35 that  $\nu (t)$  is a multiplication of a ramp function and a unit step function, as shown in Fig. 7.38. Thus,

$$
\nu (t) = 5r(t)u(-t + 2)
$$

If we replace  $u(- t)$  by  $1 - u(t)$ , then we can replace  $u(- t + 2)$  by  $1 - u(t - 2)$ . Hence,

$$
\nu (t) = 5r(t)[1 - u(t - 2)]
$$

which can be simplified as in Method 2 to get the same result.

Figure 7.39 For Practice Prob. 7.7.

Refer to Fig. 7.39. Express  $i(t)$  in terms of singularity functions.

Answer:  $2u(t) - 2r(t) + 4r(t - 2) - 2r(t - 3)$  A.

# Example 7.8

Given the signal

$$
g(t) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}3, & t< 0 \\ -2, & 0< t< 1 \\ 2t - 4, & t > 1 \end{array} \right.
$$

express  $g(t)$  in terms of step and ramp functions.

# Solution:

The signal  $g(t)$  may be regarded as the sum of three functions specified within the three intervals  $t< 0$ ,  $0< t< 1$ , and  $t > 1$ .

For  $t< 0$ ,  $g(t)$  may be regarded as 3 multiplied by  $u(- t)$ , where  $u(- t) = 1$  for  $t< 0$  and 0 for  $t > 0$ . Within the time interval  $0< t< 1$ , the function may be considered as  $- 2$  multiplied by a gated function  $[u(t) - u(t - 1)]$ . For  $t > 1$ , the function may be regarded as  $2t - 4$  multiplied by the unit step function  $u(t - 1)$ . Thus,

$$
\begin{array}{l}g(t) = 3u(-t) - 2[u(t) - u(t - 1)] + (2t - 4)u(t - 1) \\ = 3u(-t) - 2u(t) + (2t - 4 + 2)u(t - 1) \\ = 3u(-t) - 2u(t) + 2(t - 1)u(t - 1) \\ = 3u(-t) - 2u(t) + 2r(t - 1) \end{array}
$$

One may avoid the trouble of using  $u(- t)$  by replacing it with  $1 - u(t)$ . Then

$$
g(t) = 3[1 - u(t)] - 2u(t) + 2r(t - 1) = 3 - 5u(t) + 2r(t - 1)
$$

Alternatively, we may plot  $g(t)$  and apply Method 1 from Example 7.7.

If

$$
h(t) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}0, & t< 0 \\ -4, & 0< t< 2 \\ 3t - 8, & 2< t< 6 \\ 0, & t > 6 \end{array} \right.
$$

express  $h(t)$  in terms of the singularity functions.

Answer:  $- 4u(t) + 2u(t - 2) + 3r(t - 2) - 10u(t - 6) - 3r(t - 6)$ .

Evaluate the following integrals involving the impulse function:

$$
\int_{0}^{10} (t^{2} + 4t - 2) \delta (t - 2) dt
$$

$$
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \left[ \delta (t - 1) e^{-t} \cos t + \delta (t + 1) e^{-t} \sin t \right] dt
$$

# Solution:

For the first integral, we apply the sifting property in Eq. (7.32).

$$
\int_{0}^{10} (t^{2} + 4t - 2) \delta (t - 2) dt = (t^{2} + 4t - 2) |_{t = 2} = 4 + 8 - 2 = 10
$$

Similarly, for the second integral,

$$
\begin{array}{r l} & {\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\left[\delta (t - 1)e^{-t}\cos t + \delta (t + 1)e^{-t}\sin t\right]d t}\\ & {\quad = e^{-t}\cos t|_{t = 1} + e^{-t}\sin t|_{t = -1}}\\ & {\quad = e^{-1}\cos 1 + e^{1}\sin (-1) = 0.1988 - 2.2873 = -2.0885} \end{array}
$$

Evaluate the following integrals:

Answer: 28, - 1.

# 7.5 Step Response of an RC Circuit

When the dc source of an  $RC$  circuit is suddenly applied, the voltage or current source can be modeled as a step function, and the response is known as a step response.

The step response of a circuit is its behavior when the excitation is the step function, which may be a voltage or a current source.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-13/c95faf42-d8e0-4f06-a665-945fc5e108f1/ec4c3ee01652a3bac408cc99888893b57aa165578787f13f23247cfc4e4d3243.jpg)  
Figure 7.40 An  $RC$  circuit with voltage step input.

The step response is the response of the circuit due to a sudden application of a dc voltage or current source.

Consider the  $RC$  circuit in Fig. 7.40(a) which can be replaced by the circuit in Fig. 7.40(b), where  $V_{s}$  is a constant dc voltage source. Again, we select the capacitor voltage as the circuit response to be determined. We assume an initial voltage  $V_{0}$  on the capacitor, although this is not necessary for the step response. Since the voltage of a capacitor cannot change instantaneously,

$$
\nu (0^{-}) = \nu (0^{+}) = V_{0} \tag{7.40}
$$

where  $\nu (0^{- })$  is the voltage across the capacitor just before switching and  $\nu (0^{+})$  is its voltage immediately after switching. Applying KCL, we have

$$
C\frac{d\nu}{dt} +\frac{\nu - V_{s}u(t)}{R} = 0
$$

or

$$
\frac{d\nu}{dt} +\frac{\nu}{RC} = \frac{V_{s}}{RC} u(t) \tag{7.41}
$$

where  $\nu$  is the voltage across the capacitor. For  $t > 0$ , Eq. (7.41) becomes

$$
\frac{d\nu}{dt} +\frac{\nu}{RC} = \frac{V_{s}}{RC} \tag{7.42}
$$

Rearranging terms gives

$$
\frac{d\nu}{dt} = -\frac{\nu - V_{s}}{RC}
$$

or

$$
\frac{d\nu}{\nu - V_{s}} = -\frac{dt}{RC} \tag{7.43}
$$

Integrating both sides and introducing the initial conditions,

$$
\ln (\nu -V_{s})\bigg|_{V_{0}}^{\nu (t)} = -\frac{t}{RC}\bigg|_{0}^{t}
$$

$$
\ln (\nu (t) - V_{s}) - \ln (V_{0} - V_{s}) = -\frac{t}{RC} +0
$$

or

$$
\ln \frac{\nu - V_{s}}{V_{0} - V_{s}} = -\frac{t}{RC} \tag{7.44}
$$

Taking the exponential of both sides

$$
\frac{\nu - V_{s}}{V_{0} - V_{s}} = e^{-t / \tau}, \qquad \tau = RC
$$

$$
\nu -V_{s} = (V_{0} - V_{s})e^{-t / \tau}
$$

or

$$
\nu (t) = V_{s} + (V_{0} - V_{s})e^{-t / \tau}, \qquad t > 0 \tag{7.45}
$$

Thus,

$$
\nu (t) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}V_{0}, & t< 0 \\ V_{s} + (V_{0} - V_{s})e^{-t / \tau}, & t > 0 \end{array} \right. \tag{7.46}
$$

This is known as the complete response (or total response) of the  $RC$  circuit to a sudden application of a dc voltage source, assuming the capacitor is initially charged. The reason for the term "complete" will become evident a little later. Assuming that  $V_{s} > V_{0}$ , a plot of  $\nu (t)$  is shown in Fig. 7.41. If we assume that the capacitor is uncharged initially, we set  $V_{0} = 0$  in Eq. (7.46) so that

If we assume that the capacitor is uncharged initially, we set  $V_{0} = 0$  in Eq. (7.46) so that

$$
\nu (t) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}0, & t< 0 \\ V_{s}(1 - e^{-t / \tau}), & t > 0 \end{array} \right. \tag{7.47}
$$

which can be written alternatively as

$$
\nu (t) = V_{s}(1 - e^{-t / \tau})u(t) \tag{7.48}
$$

This is the complete step response of the  $RC$  circuit when the capacitor is initially uncharged. The current through the capacitor is obtained from Eq. (7.47) using  $i(t) = Cdv / dt$ . We get

$$
i(t) = C\frac{d\nu}{dt} = \frac{C}{\tau} V_{s}e^{-t / \tau}, \qquad \tau = RC, \qquad t > 0
$$

or

$$
i(t) = \frac{V_{s}}{R} e^{-t / \tau}u(t) \tag{7.49}
$$

Figure 7.42 shows the plots of capacitor voltage  $\nu (t)$  and capacitor current  $i(t)$ .

Rather than going through the derivations above, there is a systematic approach—or rather, a shortcut method—for finding the step response of an  $RC$  or  $RL$  circuit. Let us reexamine Eq. (7.45), which is more general than Eq. (7.48). It is evident that  $\nu (t)$  has two components. Classically there are two ways of decomposing this into two components. The first is to break it into a "natural response and a forced response" and the second is to break it into a "transient response and a steady- state response." Starting with the natural response and forced response, we write the total or complete response as

Complete response  $=$  natural response  $+$  forced response stored energy independent source

\nu = \nu_{n} + \nu_{f} \tag{7.50}
$$

where

$$
\nu_{n} = V_{o}e^{-t / \tau}
$$

and

$$
\nu_{f} = V_{s}(1 - e^{-t / \tau})
$$

We are familiar with the natural response  $\nu_{n}$  of the circuit, as discussed in Section 7.2.  $\nu_{f}$  is known as the forced response because it is produced by the circuit when an external "force" (a voltage source in this case) is applied. It represents what the circuit is forced to do by the input excitation. The natural response eventually dies out along with the transient component of the forced response, leaving only the steady- state component of the forced response.

Figure 7.42 Step response of an  $RC$  circuit with initially uncharged capacitor: (a) voltage response, (b) current response.

Another way of looking at the complete response is to break into two components—one temporary and the other permanent, that is

Complete response  $=$  transient response  $^+$  steady- state response temporary part permanent part

or

$$
\nu = \nu_{t} + \nu_{s s} \tag{7.51}
$$

where

$$
\nu_{t} = (V_{o} - V_{s})e^{-t / \tau} \tag{7.52a}
$$

and

$$
\nu_{s s} = V_{s} \tag{7.52b}
$$

The transient response  $\nu_{t}$  is temporary; it is the portion of the complete response that decays to zero as time approaches infinity. Thus,

The transient response is the circuit's temporary response that will die out with time.

The steady- state response  $\nu_{s s}$  is the portion of the complete response that remains after the transient response has died out. Thus,

The steady- state response is the behavior of the circuit a long time after an external excitation is applied.

The first decomposition of the complete response is in terms of the source of the responses, while the second decomposition is in terms of the permanency of the responses. Under certain conditions, the natural response and transient response are the same. The same can be said about the forced response and steady- state response.

Whichever way we look at it, the complete response in Eq. (7.45) may be written as

This is the same as saying that the complete response is the sum of the transient response and the steady- state response.

$$
\nu (t) = \nu (\infty) + [\nu (0) - \nu (\infty)]e^{-t / \tau} \tag{7.53}
$$

where  $\nu (0)$  is the initial voltage at  $t = 0^{+}$  and  $\nu (\infty)$  is the final or steady- state value. Thus, to find the step response of an  $R C$  circuit requires three things:

1. The initial capacitor voltage  $\nu (0)$

2. The final capacitor voltage  $\nu (\infty)$

3. The time constant  $\tau$

Once we know  $x(0), x(\infty)$ , and  $\tau$ , almost all the circuit problems in this chapter can be solved using the formula

$$
x(t) = x(\infty) + [x(0) - x(\infty)]e^{-t / \tau}
$$

We obtain item 1 from the given circuit for  $t< 0$  and items 2 and 3 from the circuit for  $t > 0$  . Once these items are determined, we obtain

the response using Eq. (7.53). This technique equally applies to  $RL$  circuits, as we shall see in the next section.

Note that if the switch changes position at time  $t = t_0$  instead of at  $t = 0$ , there is a time delay in the response so that Eq. (7.53) becomes

$$
\nu (t) = \nu (\infty) + [\nu (t_0) - \nu (\infty)]e^{-(t - t_0) / \tau} \tag{7.54}
$$

where  $\nu (t_0)$  is the initial value at  $t = t_0^+$ . Keep in mind that Eq. (7.53) or (7.54) applies only to step responses, that is, when the input excitation is constant.

The switch in Fig. 7.43 has been in position  $A$  for a long time. At  $t = 0$ , the switch moves to  $B$ . Determine  $\nu (t)$  for  $t > 0$  and calculate its value at  $t = 1$  and  $4 \mathrm{~s}$ .

Figure 7.43 For Example 7.10.

# Solution:

For  $t< 0$ , the switch is at position  $A$ . The capacitor acts like an open circuit to dc, but  $\nu$  is the same as the voltage across the  $5 - \mathrm{k}\Omega$  resistor. Hence, the voltage across the capacitor just before  $t = 0$  is obtained by voltage division as

$$
\nu (0^-) = \frac{5}{5 + 3} (24) = 15 \mathrm{~V}
$$

Using the fact that the capacitor voltage cannot change instantaneously,

$$
\nu (0) = \nu (0^-) = \nu (0^+) = 15 \mathrm{~V}
$$

For  $t > 0$ , the switch is in position  $B$ . The Thevenin resistance connected to the capacitor is  $R_{\mathrm{Th}} = 4 \mathrm{k}\Omega$ , and the time constant is

$$
\tau = R_{\mathrm{Th}}C = 4\times 10^{3}\times 0.5\times 10^{-3} = 2 \mathrm{~s}
$$

Since the capacitor acts like an open circuit to dc at steady state,  $\nu (\infty) = 30 \mathrm{~V}$ . Thus,

$$
\begin{aligned} \nu (t) & = \nu (\infty) + [\nu (0) - \nu (\infty)]e^{-t / \tau} \\ & = 30 + (15 - 30)e^{-t / 2} = (30 - 15e^{-0.5t}) \mathrm{~V} \end{aligned}
$$

At  $t = 1$

$$
\begin{aligned} \nu (1) & = 30 - 15e^{-0.5} = 20.9 \mathrm{~V} \\ \mathrm{At} t & = 4, \\ \nu (4) & = 30 - 15e^{-2} = 27.97 \mathrm{~V} \end{aligned}
$$

Figure 7.45 For Example 7.11.

# Solution:

The resistor current  $i$  can be discontinuous at  $t = 0$ , while the capacitor voltage  $\nu$  cannot. Hence, it is always better to find  $\nu$  and then obtain  $i$  from  $\nu$ .

By definition of the unit step function,

$$
30u(t) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} 0, & t< 0 \\ 30, & t > 0 \end{array} \right.
$$

Figure 7.46 Solution of Example 7.11: (a) for  $t< 0$ , (b) for  $t > 0$ .

For  $t< 0$ , the switch is closed and  $30u(t) = 0$ , so that the  $30u(t)$  voltage source is replaced by a short circuit and should be regarded as contributing nothing to  $\nu$ . Since the switch has been closed for a long time, the capacitor voltage has reached steady state and the capacitor acts like an open circuit. Hence, the circuit becomes that shown in Fig. 7.46(a) for  $t< 0$ . From this circuit we obtain

$$
\nu = 10 \mathrm{V}, \qquad i = -\frac{\nu}{10} = -1 \mathrm{A}
$$

Since the capacitor voltage cannot change instantaneously,

$$
\nu (0) = \nu (0^{-}) = 10 \mathrm{V}
$$

For  $t > 0$ , the switch is opened and the  $10 \mathrm{V}$  voltage source is disconnected from the circuit. The  $30u(t)$  voltage source is now operative, so the circuit becomes that shown in Fig. 7.46(b). After a long time, the circuit reaches steady state and the capacitor acts like an open circuit again. We obtain  $\nu (\infty)$  by using voltage division, writing

$$
\nu (\infty) = \frac{20}{20 + 10} (30) = 20 \mathrm{V}
$$

The Thevenin resistance at the capacitor terminals is

$$
R_{\mathrm{Th}} = 10\| 20 = \frac{10\times 20}{30} = \frac{20}{3}\Omega
$$

and the time constant is

$$
\tau = R_{\mathrm{Th}}C = \frac{20}{3}\cdot \frac{1}{4} = \frac{5}{3}\mathrm{s}
$$

Thus,

$$
\begin{array}{l}\nu (t) = \nu (\infty) + [\nu (0) - \nu (\infty)]e^{-\nu t}\\ \qquad = 20 + (10 - 20)e^{-(3 / 5)t} = (20 - 10e^{-0.6t})\mathrm{~V~} \end{array}
$$

To obtain  $i$ , we notice from Fig. 7.46(b) that  $i$  is the sum of the currents through the  $20 - \Omega$  resistor and the capacitor; that is,

$$
\begin{array}{l}i = \frac{\nu}{20} +C\frac{d\nu}{dt}\\ = 1 - 0.5e^{-0.6t} + 0.25(-0.6)(-10)e^{-0.6t} = (1 + e^{-0.6t})\mathrm{~A~} \end{array}
$$

Notice from Fig. 7.46(b) that  $\nu + 10i = 30$  is satisfied, as expected. Hence,

$$
\begin{array}{r l} & {\nu = \left\{ \begin{array}{l l}{10\mathrm{~V},} & {\quad t< 0}\\ {(20 - 10e^{-0.6t})\mathrm{~V},} & {\quad t\geq 0} \end{array} \right.}\\ & {i = \left\{ \begin{array}{l l}{-1\mathrm{~A},} & {\quad t< 0}\\ {(1 + e^{-0.6t})\mathrm{~A},} & {\quad t > 0} \end{array} \right.} \end{array}
$$

Notice that the capacitor voltage is continuous while the resistor current is not.

The switch in Fig. 7.47 is closed at  $t = 0$ . Find  $i(t)$  and  $\nu (t)$  for all time. Note that  $u(- t) = 1$  for  $t< 0$  and 0 for  $t > 0$ . Also,  $u(- t) = 1 - u(t)$ .

Figure 7.48 An  $RL$  circuit with a step input voltage.

# 7.6 Step Response of an RL Circuit

Consider the  $RL$  circuit in Fig. 7.48(a), which may be replaced by the circuit in Fig. 7.48(b). Again, our goal is to find the inductor current  $i$  as the circuit response. Rather than apply Kirchhoff's laws, we will use the simple technique in Eqs. (7.50) through (7.53). Let the response be the sum of the transient response and the steady- state response,

$$
i = i_{t} + i_{ss} \tag{7.55}
$$

We know that the transient response is always a decaying exponential, that is,

$$
i_{t} = Ae^{-t / \tau}, \qquad \tau = \frac{L}{R} \tag{7.56}
$$

where  $A$  is a constant to be determined.

The steady- state response is the value of the current a long time after the switch in Fig. 7.48(a) is closed. We know that the transient response essentially dies out after five time constants. At that time, the inductor becomes a short circuit, and the voltage across it is zero. The entire source voltage  $V_{s}$  appears across  $R$ . Thus, the steady- state response is

$$
i_{ss} = \frac{V_{s}}{R} \tag{7.57}
$$

Substituting Eqs. (7.56) and (7.57) into Eq. (7.55) gives

$$
i = Ae^{-t / \tau} + \frac{V_{s}}{R} \tag{7.58}
$$

We now determine the constant  $A$  from the initial value of  $i$ . Let  $I_{0}$  be the initial current through the inductor, which may come from a source other than  $V_{s}$ . Since the current through the inductor cannot change instantaneously,

$$
i(0^{+}) = i(0^{-}) = I_{0} \tag{7.59}
$$

Thus, at  $t = 0$ , Eq. (7.58) becomes

$$
I_{0} = A + \frac{V_{s}}{R}
$$

From this, we obtain  $A$  as

$$
A = I_{0} - \frac{V_{s}}{R}
$$

Substituting for  $A$  in Eq. (7.58), we get

$$
i(t) = \frac{V_{s}}{R} + \left(I_{0} - \frac{V_{s}}{R}\right) e^{-t / \tau} \tag{7.60}
$$

Figure 7.49 Total response of the  $RL$  circuit with initial inductor current  $I_{0}$ .

This is the complete response of the  $RL$  circuit. It is illustrated in Fig. 7.49. The response in Eq. (7.60) may be written as

$$
i(t) = i(\infty) + [i(0) - i(\infty)] e^{-t / \tau} \tag{7.61}
$$

where  $i(0)$  and  $i(\infty)$  are the initial and final values of  $i$ , respectively. Thus, to find the step response of an  $RL$  circuit requires three things:

1. The initial inductor current  $i(0)$  at  $t = 0$ .  
2. The final inductor current  $i(\infty)$ .  
3. The time constant  $\tau$ .

We obtain item 1 from the given circuit for  $t< 0$  and items 2 and 3 from the circuit for  $t > 0$ . Once these items are determined, we obtain the response using Eq. (7.61). Keep in mind that this technique applies only for step responses.

Again, if the switching takes place at time  $t = t_0$  instead of  $t = 0$ , Eq. (7.61) becomes

$$
i(t) = i(\infty) + [i(t_0) - i(\infty)]e^{-(t - t_0) / \tau} \tag{7.62}
$$

If  $I_0 = 0$ , then

$$
i(t) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}0, & t< 0 \\ \frac{V_s}{R} (1 - e^{-t / \tau}), & t > 0 \end{array} \right. \tag{7.63a}
$$

or

$$
i(t) = \frac{V_s}{R} (1 - e^{-t / \tau})u(t) \tag{7.63b}
$$

This is the step response of the  $RL$  circuit with no initial inductor current. The voltage across the inductor is obtained from Eq. (7.63) using  $\nu = L \frac{di}{dt}$ . We get

$$
\nu (t) = L\frac{di}{dt} = V_s\frac{L}{\tau R} e^{-t / \tau},\qquad \tau = \frac{L}{R},\qquad t > 0
$$

or

$$
\nu (t) = V_s e^{-t / \tau} u(t) \tag{7.64}
$$

Figure 7.50 shows the step responses in Eqs. (7.63) and (7.64).

Figure 7.51 For Example 7.12.

Find  $i(t)$  in the circuit of Fig. 7.51 for  $t > 0$ . Assume that the switch has been closed for a long time.

# Solution:

When  $t< 0$ , the  $3 - \Omega$  resistor is short- circuited, and the inductor acts like a short circuit. The current through the inductor at  $t = 0^-$  (i.e., just before  $t = 0$ ) is

$$
i(0^{-}) = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \mathrm{~A}
$$

Because the inductor current cannot change instantaneously,

$$
i(0) = i(0^{+}) = i(0^{-}) = 5 \mathrm{~A}
$$

When  $t > 0$ , the switch is open. The  $2 -$  and  $3 - \Omega$  resistors are in series, so that

$$
i(\infty) = \frac{10}{2 + 3} = 2 \mathrm{~A}
$$

The Thevenin resistance across the inductor terminals is

$$
R_{\mathrm{Th}} = 2 + 3 = 5 \Omega
$$

For the time constant,

$$
\tau = \frac{L}{R_{\mathrm{Th}}} = \frac{\frac{1}{3}}{5} = \frac{1}{15} s
$$

Thus,

$$
\begin{array}{l}i(t) = i(\infty) + [i(0) - i(\infty)]e^{-t / \tau} \\ = 2 + (5 - 2)e^{-15t} = 2 + 3e^{-15t} \mathrm{~A}, \qquad t > 0 \end{array}
$$

Check: In Fig. 7.51, for  $t > 0$ , KVL must be satisfied; that is,

$$
10 = 5i + L \frac{di}{dt}
$$

$$
5i + L \frac{di}{dt} = [10 + 15e^{-15t}] + \left[\frac{1}{3} (3)(-15)e^{-15t}\right] = 10
$$

This confirms the result.

Answer:  $(4 + 2e^{- 10t})$  A for all  $t > 0$ .

Figure 7.53 For Example 7.13.

# Solution:

We need to consider the three time intervals  $t \leq 0$ ,  $0 \leq t \leq 4$ , and  $t \geq 4$  separately. For  $t < 0$ , switches  $S_{1}$  and  $S_{2}$  are open so that  $i = 0$ . Since the inductor current cannot change instantly,

$$
i(0^{-}) = i(0) = i(0^{+}) = 0
$$

For  $0 \leq t \leq 4$ ,  $S_{1}$  is closed so that the 4- and  $6 - \Omega$  resistors are in series. (Remember, at this time,  $S_{2}$  is still open.) Hence, assuming for now that  $S_{1}$  is closed forever,

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{i(\infty)=\frac{40}{4+6}=4\mathrm{A},\qquad R_{\mathrm{Th}}=4+6=10\Omega}}\\ {{\tau=\frac{L}{R_{\mathrm{Th}}}=\frac{5}{10}=\frac{1}{2}\mathrm{s}}}\end{array}
$$

Thus,

$$
\begin{array}{l}{{i(t)=i(\infty)+[i(0)-i(\infty)]e^{-t/\tau}}}\\ {{\ }}\\ {{=4+(0-4)e^{-2t}=4(1-e^{-2t})\mathrm{A},\qquad 0\leq t\leq4}}\end{array}
$$

For  $t \geq 4$ ,  $S_{2}$  is closed; the 10- V voltage source is connected, and the circuit changes. This sudden change does not affect the inductor current because the current cannot change abruptly. Thus, the initial current is

$$
i(4) = i(4^{-}) = 4(1 - e^{-8}) \simeq 4 \mathrm{~A}
$$

To find  $i(\infty)$ , let  $\nu$  be the voltage at node  $P$  in Fig. 7.53. Using KCL,

$$
\frac{40 - \nu}{4} + \frac{10 - \nu}{2} = \frac{\nu}{6} \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad \nu = \frac{180}{11} \mathrm{~V}
$$

$$
i(\infty) = \frac{\nu}{6} = \frac{30}{11} = 2.727 \mathrm{~A}
$$

The Thevenin resistance at the inductor terminals is

$$
R_{\mathrm{Th}} = 4 \| 2 + 6 = \frac{4 \times 2}{6} + 6 = \frac{22}{3} \Omega
$$

and

$$
\tau = \frac{L}{R_{\mathrm{Th}}} = \frac{5}{\frac{22}{3}} = \frac{15}{22} \mathrm{~s}
$$

Hence,

$$
i(t) = i(\infty) + [i(4) - i(\infty)]e^{-(t - 4) / \tau}, \qquad t \geq 4
$$

We need  $(t - 4)$  in the exponential because of the time delay. Thus,

$$
i(t) = 2.727 + (4 - 2.727)e^{-(t - 4) / \tau}, \qquad \tau = \frac{15}{22}
$$

$$
= 2.727 + 1.273e^{-1.4667(t - 4)}, \qquad t \geq 4
$$

Putting all this together,

$$
\begin{array}{l l}{{i(t)={0,\qquad}}}&{{t\leq0}}\\ {{i(t)={4(1-e^{-2t}),\qquad}}}&{{0\leq t\leq4}}\\ {{2.727+1.273e^{-1.4667(t-4)},\qquad}}&{{t\geq4}}\end{array}
$$

At  $t = 2$

$$
i(2) = 4(1 - e^{-4}) = 3.93\mathrm{~A~}
$$

# 7.7 First-Order Op Amp Circuits

An op amp circuit containing a storage element will exhibit first- order behavior. Differentiators and integrators treated in Section 6.6 are examples of first- order op amp circuits. Again, for practical reasons, inductors are hardly ever used in op amp circuits; therefore, the op amp circuits we consider here are of the  $RC$  type.

As usual, we analyze op amp circuits using nodal analysis. Sometimes, the Thevenin equivalent circuit is used to reduce the op amp circuit to one that we can easily handle. The following three examples illustrate the concepts. The first one deals with a source- free op amp circuit, while the other two involve step responses. The three examples have been carefully selected to cover all possible  $RC$  types of op amp circuits, depending on the location of the capacitor with respect to the op amp; that is, the capacitor can be located in the input, the output, or the feedback loop.

For the op amp circuit in Fig. 7.55(a), find  $\nu_{o}$  for  $t > 0$ , given that  $\nu (0) = 3 \mathrm{~V}$ . Let  $R_{f} = 80 \mathrm{k} \Omega$ ,  $R_{1} = 20 \mathrm{k} \Omega$ , and  $C = 5 \mu \mathrm{F}$ .

Figure 7.55 For Example 7.14.

# Solution:

This problem can be solved in two ways:

METHOD 1 Consider the circuit in Fig. 7.55(a). Let us derive the appropriate differential equation using nodal analysis. If  $\nu_{1}$  is the voltage at node 1, at that node, KCL gives

$$
\frac{0 - \nu_{1}}{R_{1}} = C \frac{d \nu}{dt} \tag{7.14.1}
$$

Because nodes 2 and 3 must be at the same potential, the potential at node 2 is zero. Thus,  $\nu_{1} - 0 = \nu$  or  $\nu_{1} = \nu$  and Eq. (7.14.1) becomes

$$
\frac{d \nu}{dt} + \frac{\nu}{C R_{1}} = 0 \tag{7.14.2}
$$

This is similar to Eq. (7.4b) so that the solution is obtained the same way as in Section 7.2, i.e.,

$$
\nu (t) = V_{0} e^{-t / \tau}, \qquad \tau = R_{1} C \tag{7.14.3}
$$

where  $V_{0}$  is the initial voltage across the capacitor. But  $\nu (0) = 3 = V_{0}$  and  $\tau = 20 \times 10^{3} \times 5 \times 10^{- 6} = 0.1$ . Hence,

$$
\nu (t) = 3 e^{-10 t} \tag{7.14.4}
$$

Applying KCL at node 2 gives

$$
C \frac{d \nu}{dt} = \frac{0 - \nu_{o}}{R_{f}}
$$

or

$$
\nu_{o} = -R_{f} C \frac{d \nu}{dt} \tag{7.14.5}
$$

Now we can find  $\nu_{0}$  as

$$
\nu_{o} = -80 \times 10^{3} \times 5 \times 10^{-6} (-30 e^{-10 t}) = 12 e^{-10 t} \mathrm{~V}, \qquad t > 0
$$

METHOD 2 Let us apply the shortcut method from Eq. (7.53). We need to find  $\nu_{o}(0^{+})$ ,  $\nu_{o}(\infty)$ , and  $\tau$ . Since  $\nu (0^{+}) = \nu (0^{- }) = 3 \mathrm{~V}$ , we apply KCL at node 2 in the circuit of Fig. 7.55(b) to obtain

$$
\frac{3}{20,000} + \frac{0 - \nu_{o}(0^{+})}{80,000} = 0
$$

or  $\nu_{o}(0^{+}) = 12 \mathrm{~V}$ . Since the circuit is source free,  $\nu (\infty) = 0 \mathrm{~V}$ . To find  $\tau$ , we need the equivalent resistance  $R_{eq}$  across the capacitor terminals. If we remove the capacitor and replace it by a 1- A current source, we have the circuit shown in Fig. 7.55(c). Applying KVL to the input loop yields

Then

$$
20,000(1) - \nu = 0 \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad \nu = 20 \mathrm{kV}
$$

$$
R_{\mathrm{eq}} = \frac{\nu}{1} = 20 \mathrm{k}\Omega
$$

and  $\tau = R_{\mathrm{eq}}C = 0.1$ . Thus,

$$
\begin{array}{r l} & {\nu_{o}(t) = \nu_{o}(\infty) + [\nu_{o}(0) - \nu_{o}(\infty)]e^{-t / \tau}}\\ & {\qquad = 0 + (12 - 0)e^{-10t} = 12e^{-10t}\mathrm{~V},\qquad t > 0} \end{array}
$$

as before.

Figure 7.56 For Practice Prob. 7.14.

For the op amp circuit in Fig. 7.56, find  $\nu_{o}$  for  $t > 0$  if  $\nu (0) = 4 \mathrm{~V}$ . Assume that  $R_{f} = 50 \mathrm{k}\Omega$ ,  $R_{1} = 10 \mathrm{k}\Omega$ , and  $C = 10 \mu \mathrm{F}$ .

Answer:  $- 4e^{- 2t} \mathrm{~V}, t > 0$ .

Determine  $\nu (t)$  and  $\nu_{o}(t)$  in the circuit of Fig. 7.57.

# Solution:

This problem can be solved in two ways, just like the previous example. However, we will apply only the second method. Since what we are looking for is the step response, we can apply Eq. (7.53) and write

$$
\nu (t) = \nu (\infty) + [\nu (0) - \nu (\infty)]e^{-t / \tau}, \qquad t > 0 \tag{7.15.1}
$$

where we need only find the time constant  $\tau$ , the initial value  $\nu (0)$ , and the final value  $\nu (\infty)$ . Notice that this applies strictly to the capacitor voltage due a step input. Since no current enters the input terminals of the op amp, the elements on the feedback loop of the op amp constitute an  $RC$  circuit, with

$$
\tau = RC = 50\times 10^{3}\times 10^{-6} = 0.05 \tag{7.15.2}
$$

For  $t< 0$ , the switch is open and there is no voltage across the capacitor. Hence,  $\nu (0) = 0$ . For  $t > 0$ , we obtain the voltage at node 1 by voltage division as

$$
\nu_{1} = \frac{20}{20 + 10} 3 = 2 \mathrm{~V} \tag{7.15.3}
$$

Since there is no storage element in the input loop,  $\nu_{1}$  remains constant for all  $t$ . At steady state, the capacitor acts like an open circuit so that the op amp circuit is a noninverting amplifier. Thus,

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-13/c95faf42-d8e0-4f06-a665-945fc5e108f1/5269929b842350ac5efe798ee9d9233db603eee0640958b53495fa6d2bbd7f96.jpg)  
Figure 7.57 For Example 7.15.

$$
\nu_{o}(\infty) = \left(1 + \frac{50}{20}\right)\nu_{1} = 3.5\times 2 = 7 \mathrm{~V} \tag{7.15.4}
$$

But

$$
\nu_{1} - \nu_{o} = \nu \tag{7.15.5}
$$

so that

$$
\nu (\infty) = 2 - 7 = -5 \mathrm{~V}
$$

Substituting  $\tau$ ,  $\nu (0)$ , and  $\nu (\infty)$  into Eq. (7.15.1) gives

$$
\nu (t) = -5 + [0 - (-5)]e^{-20t} = 5(e^{-20t} - 1) \mathrm{~V}, \qquad t > 0 \tag{7.15.6}
$$

From Eqs. (7.15.3), (7.15.5), and (7.15.6), we obtain

$$
\nu_{o}(t) = \nu_{1}(t) - \nu (t) = 7 - 5e^{-20t} \mathrm{~V}, \qquad t > 0 \tag{7.15.7}
$$

Find  $\nu (t)$  and  $\nu_{o}(t)$  in the op amp circuit of Fig. 7.58.

Answer: (Note, the voltage across the capacitor and the output voltage must be both equal to zero, for  $t< 0$ , since the input was zero for all  $t< 0$ .)  $40(1 - e^{- 10t}) u(t) \mathrm{mV}$ ,  $40(e^{- 10t} - 1) u(t) \mathrm{mV}$ .

Find the step response  $\nu_{o}(t)$  for  $t > 0$  in the op amp circuit of Fig. 7.59. Let  $\nu_{i} = 2u(t)$  V,  $R_{1} = 20\mathrm{k}\Omega$ $R_{f} = 50\mathrm{k}\Omega$ $R_{2} = R_{3} = 10\mathrm{k}\Omega$ $C = 2\mu \mathrm{F}$

# Solution:

Notice that the capacitor in Example 7.14 is located in the input loop, while the capacitor in Example 7.15 is located in the feedback loop. In this example, the capacitor is located in the output of the op amp. Again, we can solve this problem directly using nodal analysis. However, using the Thevenin equivalent circuit may simplify the problem.

We temporarily remove the capacitor and find the Thevenin equivalent at its terminals. To obtain  $V_{\mathrm{Th}}$  consider the circuit in Fig. 7.60(a). Since the circuit is an inverting amplifier,

$$
V_{ab} = -\frac{R_{f}}{R_{1}} \nu_{i}
$$

By voltage division,

$$
V_{\mathrm{Th}} = \frac{R_{3}}{R_{2} + R_{3}} V_{ab} = -\frac{R_{3}}{R_{2} + R_{3}} \frac{R_{f}}{R_{1}} \nu_{i}
$$

Figure 7.60 Obtaining  $V_{\mathrm{Th}}$  and  $R_{\mathrm{Th}}$  across the capacitor in Fig. 7.59.

To obtain  $R_{\mathrm{Th}}$  consider the circuit in Fig. 7.60(b), where  $R_{o}$  is the output resistance of the op amp. Since we are assuming an ideal op amp,  $R_{o} = 0$ , and

$$
R_{\mathrm{Th}} = R_{2} \parallel R_{3} = \frac{R_{2} R_{3}}{R_{2} + R_{3}}
$$

Substituting the given numerical values,

$$
V_{\mathrm{Th}} = -\frac{R_{3}}{R_{2} + R_{3}} \frac{R_{f}}{R_{1}} \nu_{i} = -\frac{10}{20} \frac{50}{20} 2u(t) = -2.5u(t)

Figure 7.61 Thevenin equivalent circuit of the circuit in Fig. 7.59.

The Thevenin equivalent circuit is shown in Fig. 7.61, which is similar to Fig. 7.40. Hence, the solution is similar to that in Eq. (7.48); that is,

$$
\nu_{o}(t) = -2.5(1 - e^{-t / \tau}) u(t)
$$

where  $\tau = R_{\mathrm{Th}} C = 5 \times 10^{3} \times 2 \times 10^{- 6} = 0.01$ . Thus, the step response for  $t > 0$  is

$$
\nu_{o}(t) = 2.5(e^{-100t} - 1) u(t) \mathrm{V}
$$

Obtain the step response  $\nu_{o}(t)$  for the circuit in Fig. 7.62. Let  $\nu_{i} = 4.5u(t)$  V,  $R_{1} = 20\mathrm{k}\Omega$ ,  $R_{f} = 40\mathrm{k}\Omega$ ,  $R_{2} = R_{3} = 10\mathrm{k}\Omega$ ,  $C = 2\mu \mathrm{F}$ .

Answer:  $13.5(1 - e^{- 50t})u(t)$  V.

# 7.8 Transient Analysis with PSpice

As we discussed in Section 7.5, the transient response is the temporary response of the circuit that soon disappears. PSpice can be used to obtain the transient response of a circuit with storage elements. Section D.4 in Appendix D provides a review of transient analysis using PSpice for Windows. It is recommended that you read Section D.4 before continuing with this section.

If necessary, dc PSpice analysis is first carried out to determine the initial conditions. Then the initial conditions are used in the transient PSpice analysis to obtain the transient responses. It is recommended but not necessary that during this dc analysis, all capacitors should be open- circuited while all inductors should be short- circuited.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-13/c95faf42-d8e0-4f06-a665-945fc5e108f1/9b941e07945fe0f2bb7350399c90cd517ff7c945de1dbb72c742d4286cdaec22.jpg)  
Figure 7.62 For Practice Prob. 7.16.

PSpice uses "transient" to mean "function of time." Therefore, the transient response in PSpice may not actually die out as expected.

Use PSpice to find the response  $i(t)$  for  $t > 0$  in the circuit of Fig. 7.63.

# Solution:

Solving this problem by hand gives  $i(0) = 0$ ,  $i(\infty) = 2\mathrm{A}$ ,  $R_{\mathrm{Th}} = 6$ ,  $\tau = 3 / 6 = 0.5\mathrm{s}$ , so that

$$
i(t) = i(\infty) + [i(0) - i(\infty)]e^{-t / \tau} = 2(1 - e^{-2t}),\qquad t > 0
$$

To use PSpice, we first draw the schematic as shown in Fig. 7.64. We recall from Appendix D that the part name for a closed switch is Sw_tclose. We do not need to specify the initial condition of the inductor because PSpice will determine that from the circuit. By selecting Analysis/Setup/Transient, we set Print Step to  $25\mathrm{ms}$  and Final Step to  $5\tau = 2.5\mathrm{s}$ . After saving the circuit, we simulate by selecting Analysis/ Simulate. In the PSpice A/D window, we select Trace/Add and display - I(L1) as the current through the inductor. Figure 7.65 shows the plot of  $i(t)$ , which agrees with that obtained by hand calculation.

Note that the negative sign on I(L1) is needed because the current enters through the upper terminal of the inductor, which happens to be the negative terminal after one counterclockwise rotation. A way to avoid the negative sign is to ensure that current enters pin 1 of the inductor. To obtain this desired direction of positive current flow, the initially horizontal inductor symbol should be rotated counterclockwise  $270^{\circ}$  and placed in the desired location.

Figure 7.66 For Practice Prob. 7.17.

For the circuit in Fig. 7.66, use Pspice to find  $\nu (t)$  for  $t > 0$ .

Answer:  $\nu (t) = 8(1 - e^{- t})$  V,  $t > 0$ . The response is similar in shape to that in Fig. 7.65.

Figure 7.67 For Example 7.18. Original circuit (a), circuit for  $t > 0$  (b), and reduced circuit for  $t > 0$  (c).

# Solution:

1. Define. The problem is clearly stated and the circuit is clearly labeled.

2. Present. Given the circuit shown in Fig. 7.67(a), determine the response  $\nu (t)$ .

3. Alternative. We can solve this circuit using circuit analysis techniques, nodal analysis, mesh analysis, or PSpice. Let us solve the problem using circuit analysis techniques (this time Thevenin equivalent circuits) and then check the answer using two methods of PSpice.

4. Attempt. For time  $< 0$ , the switch on the left is open and the switch on the right is closed. Assume that the switch on the right has been closed long enough for the circuit to reach steady state; then the capacitor acts like an open circuit and the current from the 4-A source flows through the parallel combination of the  $6 - \Omega$  and  $3 - \Omega$  resistors  $(6 \parallel 3 = 18 / 9 = 2)$ , producing a voltage equal to  $2 \times 4 = 8 \mathrm{~V} = - \nu (0)$ .

At  $t = 0$ , the switch on the left closes and the switch on the right opens, producing the circuit shown in Fig. 7.67(b).

The easiest way to complete the solution is to find the Thevenin equivalent circuit as seen by the capacitor. The opencircuit voltage (with the capacitor removed) is equal to the voltage drop across the  $6 - \Omega$  resistor on the left, or  $10~\mathrm{V}$  (the voltage drops uniformly across the  $12 - \Omega$  resistor,  $20~\mathrm{V}$  and across the  $6 - \Omega$  resistor,  $10~\mathrm{V}$  ). This is  $V_{\mathrm{Th}}$  . The resistance looking in where the capacitor was is equal to  $12\parallel 6 + 6 = 72 / 18 + 6 = 10\Omega$  , which is  $R_{\mathrm{eq}}$  . This produces the Thevenin equivalent circuit shown in Fig. 7.67(c). Matching up the boundary conditions  $(\nu (0) = - 8\mathrm{~V~}$  and  $\nu (\infty) = 10\mathrm{~V~}$  ) and  $\tau = RC = 1$  , we get

$$
\nu (t) = 10 - 18\mathrm{e}^{-\mathrm{t}}\mathrm{V}
$$

5. Evaluate. There are two ways of solving the problem using PSpice.

METHOD 1 One way is to first do the dc PSpice analysis to determine the initial capacitor voltage. The schematic of the revelant circuit is in Fig. 7.68(a). Two pseudocomponent VIEWPOINTS are inserted to measure the voltages at nodes 1 and 2. When the circuit is simulated, we obtain the displayed values in Fig. 7.68(a) as  $V_{1} = 0 \mathrm{~V}$  and  $V_{2} = 8 \mathrm{~V}$ . Thus, the initial capacitor voltage is  $\nu (0) = V_{1} - V_{2} = - 8 \mathrm{~V}$ . The PSpice transient analysis uses this value along with the schematic in Fig. 7.68(b). Once the circuit in Fig. 7.68(b) is drawn, we insert the capacitor initial voltage as  $\mathrm{IC} = - 8$ . We select Analysis/Setup/Transient and set Print Step to  $0.1 \mathrm{~s}$  and Final Step to  $4 \tau = 4 \mathrm{~s}$ . After saving the circuit, we select Analysis/Simulate to simulate the circuit. In the PSpice A/D window, we select Trace/Add and display  $\mathrm{V}(\mathrm{R}2:2) - \mathrm{V}(\mathrm{R}3:2)$  or  $\mathrm{V}(\mathrm{C}1:1) - \mathrm{V}(\mathrm{C}1:2)$  as the capacitor voltage  $\nu (t)$ . The plot of  $\nu (t)$  is shown in Fig. 7.69. This agrees with the result obtained by hand calculation,  $\nu (t) = 10 - 18 e^{- t} \mathrm{~V}$ .

■ METHOD 2 We can simulate the circuit in Fig. 7.67 directly, since PSpice can handle the open and closed switches and determine the initial conditions automatically. Using this approach, the schematic is drawn as shown in Fig. 7.70. After drawing the circuit, we select Analysis/Setup/Transient and set Print Step to 0.1 s and Final Step to  $4\tau = 4$  s. We save the circuit, then select Analysis/Simulate to simulate the circuit. In the PSpice A/D window, we select Trace/Add and display  $\mathrm{V}(\mathrm{R}2:2) - \mathrm{V}(\mathrm{R}3:2)$  as the capacitor voltage  $\nu (t)$ . The plot of  $\nu (t)$  is the same as that shown in Fig. 7.69.

# 7.9 Applications

The various devices in which  $RC$  and  $RL$  circuits find applications include filtering in dc power supplies, smoothing circuits in digital communications, differentiators, integrators, delay circuits, and relay circuits. Some of these applications take advantage of the short or long time constants of the  $RC$  or  $RL$  circuits. We will consider four simple applications here. The first two are  $RC$  circuits, the last two are  $RL$  circuits.

# 7.9.1 Delay Circuits

An  $RC$  circuit can be used to provide various time delays. Figure 7.73 shows such a circuit. It basically consists of an  $RC$  circuit with the capacitor connected in parallel with a neon lamp. The voltage source can provide enough voltage to fire the lamp. When the switch is closed, the capacitor voltage increases gradually toward  $110\mathrm{V}$  at a rate determined by the circuit's time constant,  $(R_{1} + R_{2})C$ . The lamp will act as an open

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-13/c95faf42-d8e0-4f06-a665-945fc5e108f1/ecfd0c3d02b654b70ab67f28cebffe7973d942ff48f523b32aad817c79ca77a0.jpg)  
Figure 7.73 An  $RC$  delay circuit.

circuit and not emit light until the voltage across it exceeds a particular level, say  $70~\mathrm{V}$ . When the voltage level is reached, the lamp fires (goes on), and the capacitor discharges through it. Due to the low resistance of the lamp when on, the capacitor voltage drops fast and the lamp turns off. The lamp acts again as an open circuit and the capacitor recharges. By adjusting  $R_{2}$ , we can introduce either short or long time delays into the circuit and make the lamp fire, recharge, and fire repeatedly every time constant  $\tau = (R_{1} + R_{2})C$ , because it takes a time period  $\tau$  to get the capacitor voltage high enough to fire or low enough to turn off.The warning blinkers commonly found on road construction sites are one example of the usefulness of such an  $RC$  delay circuit.

The warning blinkers commonly found on road construction sites are one example of the usefulness of such an  $RC$  delay circuit.

Example 7.19 Consider the circuit in Fig. 7.73, and assume that  $R_{1} = 1.5 \mathrm{M}\Omega$ ,  $0 < R_{2} < 2.5 \mathrm{M}\Omega$ . (a) Calculate the extreme limits of the time constant of the circuit. (b) How long does it take for the lamp to glow for the first time after the switch is closed? Let  $R_{2}$  assume its largest value.

# Solution:

(a) The smallest value for  $R_{2}$  is  $0\Omega$  , and the corresponding time constant for the circuit is

$$
\tau = (R_{1} + R_{2})C = (1.5\times 10^{6} + 0)\times 0.1\times 10^{-6} = 0.15\mathrm{~s~}
$$

The largest value for  $R_{2}$  is  $2.5\mathrm{M}\Omega$  , and the corresponding time constant for the circuit is

$$
\tau = (R_{1} + R_{2})C = (1.5 + 2.5)\times 10^{6}\times 0.1\times 10^{-6} = 0.4\mathrm{~s~}
$$

Thus, by proper circuit design, the time constant can be adjusted to introduce a proper time delay in the circuit.

(b) Assuming that the capacitor is initially uncharged,  $\nu_{C}(0) = 0$  , while  $\nu_{C}(\infty) = 110$  .But

$$
\nu_{C}(t) = \nu_{C}(\infty) + [\nu_{C}(0) - \nu_{C}(\infty)]e^{-t / \tau} = 110[1 - e^{-t / \tau}]
$$

where  $\tau = 0.4\mathrm{s}$  , as calculated in part (a). The lamp glows when  $\nu_{C} = 70\mathrm{V}$  If  $\nu_{C}(t) = 70\mathrm{V}$  at  $\tau = t_{0}$  , then

$$
70 = 110[1 - e^{-t_{0} / \tau}] \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad \frac{7}{11} = 1 - e^{-t_{0} / \tau}
$$

or

$$
e^{-t_{0} / \tau} = \frac{4}{11} \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad e^{t_{0} / \tau} = \frac{11}{4}
$$

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides gives

$$
t_{0} = \tau \ln {\frac{11}{4}} = 0.4\ln 2.75 = 0.4046\mathrm{~s~}
$$

A more general formula for finding  $t_{0}$  is

$$
t_{0} = \tau \ln{\frac{-\nu(\infty)}{\nu(t_{0}) - \nu(\infty)}}
$$

The lamp will fire repeatedly every  $t_{0}$  seconds if and only if  $\nu (t_{0})< \nu (\infty)$

The  $RC$  circuit in Fig. 7.74 is designed to operate an alarm which activates when the current through it exceeds  $120\mu \mathrm{A}$ . If  $0 \leq R \leq 6\mathrm{k}\Omega$ , find the range of the time delay that the variable resistor can create.

Answer: Between 47.23 and  $124\mathrm{ms}$ .

# 7.9.2 Photoflash Unit

An electronic flash unit provides a common example of an  $RC$  circuit. This application exploits the ability of the capacitor to oppose any abrupt change in voltage. Figure 7.75 shows a simplified circuit. It consists essentially of a high- voltage dc supply, a current- limiting large resistor  $R_{1}$ , and a capacitor  $C$  in parallel with the flashlamp of low resistance  $R_{2}$ . When the switch is in position 1, the capacitor charges slowly due to the large time constant  $(\tau_{1} = R_{1}C)$ . As shown in Fig. 7.76(a), the capacitor voltage rises gradually from zero to  $V_{s}$ , while its current decreases gradually from  $I_{1} = V_{s} / R_{1}$  to zero. The charging time is approximately five times the time constant,

$$
t_{\mathrm{charge}} = 5R_{1}C \tag{7.65}
$$

With the switch in position 2, the capacitor voltage is discharged. The low resistance  $R_{2}$  of the photolamp permits a high discharge current with peak  $I_{2} = V_{s} / R_{2}$  in a short duration, as depicted in Fig. 7.76(b). Discharging takes place in approximately five times the time constant,

$$
t_{\mathrm{discharge}} = 5R_{2}C \tag{7.66}
$$

Thus, the simple  $RC$  circuit of Fig. 7.75 provides a short- duration, high- current pulse. Such a circuit also finds applications in electric spot welding and the radar transmitter tube.

An electronic flashgun has a current- limiting  $6 - \mathrm{k}\Omega$  resistor and  $2000 - \mu \mathrm{F}$  electrolytic capacitor charged to  $240~\mathrm{V}$ . If the lamp resistance is  $12\Omega$ , find: (a) the peak charging current, (b) the time required for the capacitor to fully charge, (c) the peak discharging current, (d) the total energy stored in the capacitor, and the average power dissipated by the lamp.

# Solution:

(a) The peak charging current is

$$
I_{1} = \frac{V_{s}}{R_{1}} = \frac{240}{6\times 10^{3}} = 40\mathrm{mA}
$$

(b) From Eq. (7.65),

$$
t_{\mathrm{charge}} = 5R_{1}C = 5\times 6\times 10^{3}\times 2000\times 10^{-6} = 60\mathrm{s} = 1\mathrm{minute}
$$

(c) The peak discharging current is

$$
I_{2} = \frac{V_{s}}{R_{2}} = \frac{240}{12} = 20\mathrm{~A~}
$$

(d) The energy stored is

$$
W = \frac{1}{2} CV_{s}^{2} = \frac{1}{2}\times 2000\times 10^{-6}\times 240^{2} = 57.6\mathrm{~J}
$$

The energy stored in the capacitor is dissipated across the lamp during the discharging period. From Eq. (7.66),

$$
t_{\mathrm{discharge}} = 5R_{2}C = 5\times 12\times 2000\times 10^{-6} = 0.12\mathrm{~s~}
$$

Thus, the average power dissipated is

$$
p = \frac{W}{t_{\mathrm{discharge}}} = \frac{57.6}{0.12} = 480\mathrm{~watts}
$$

# 7.9.3 Relay Circuits

A magnetically controlled switch is called a relay. A relay is essentially an electromagnetic device used to open or close a switch that controls another circuit. Figure 7.77(a) shows a typical relay circuit. The coil

circuit is an  $RL$  circuit like that in Fig. 7.77(b), where  $R$  and  $L$  are the resistance and inductance of the coil. When switch  $S_{1}$  in Fig. 7.77(a) is closed, the coil circuit is energized. The coil current gradually increases and produces a magnetic field. Eventually the magnetic field is sufficiently strong to pull the movable contact in the other circuit and close switch  $S_{2}$ . At this point, the relay is said to be pulled in. The time interval  $t_{d}$  between the closure of switches  $S_{1}$  and  $S_{2}$  is called the relay delay time.

Relays were used in the earliest digital circuits and are still used for switching high- power circuits.

Figure 7.77 A relay circuit.

The coil of a certain relay is operated by a 12- V battery. If the coil has a resistance of  $150\Omega$  and an inductance of  $30~\mathrm{mH}$  and the current needed to pull in is  $50~\mathrm{mA}$ , calculate the relay delay time.

# Solution:

The current through the coil is given by

$$
i(t) = i(\infty) + [i(0) - i(\infty)]e^{-t / \tau}
$$

where

$$
i(0) = 0,\qquad i(\infty) = \frac{12}{150} = 80\mathrm{mA}
$$

$$
\tau = \frac{L}{R} = \frac{30\times 10^{-3}}{150} = 0.2\mathrm{ms}
$$

Thus,

$$
i(t) = 80[1 - e^{-t / \tau}]\mathrm{mA}
$$

If  $i(t_{d}) = 50\mathrm{mA}$ , then

$$
50 = 80[1 - e^{-t_d / \tau}]\qquad \Rightarrow \qquad \frac{5}{8} = 1 - e^{-t_d / \tau}
$$

or

$$
e^{-t_d / \tau} = \frac{3}{8}\qquad \Rightarrow \qquad e^{t_d / \tau} = \frac{8}{3}
$$

By taking the natural logarithm of both sides, we get

$$
t_{d} = \tau \ln {\frac{8}{3}} = 0.2\ln {\frac{8}{3}}\mathrm{ms} = 0.1962\mathrm{ms}
$$

Alternatively, we may find  $t_{d}$  using

$$
t_{d} = \tau \ln {\frac{i(0) - i(\infty)}{i(t_{d}) - i(\infty)}}
$$

# Practice Problem 7.21

Answer:  $2.529\mathrm{ms}$

Figure 7.78 Circuit for an automobile ignition system.

# 7.9.4 Automobile Ignition Circuit

The ability of inductors to oppose rapid change in current makes them useful for arc or spark generation. An automobile ignition system takes advantage of this feature.

The gasoline engine of an automobile requires that the fuel- air mixture in each cylinder be ignited at proper times. This is achieved by means of a spark plug (Fig. 7.78), which essentially consists of a pair of electrodes separated by an air gap. By creating a large voltage (thousands of volts) between the electrodes, a spark is formed across the air gap, thereby igniting the fuel. But how can such a large voltage be obtained from the car battery, which supplies only  $12\mathrm{V}$ ? This is achieved by means of an inductor (the spark coil)  $L$ . Since the voltage across the inductor is  $\nu = L\frac{di}{dt}$ , we can make  $\frac{di}{dt}$  large by creating a large change in current in a very short time. When the ignition switch in Fig. 7.78 is closed, the current through the inductor increases gradually and reaches the final value of  $i = V_{s} / R$ , where  $V_{s} = 12\mathrm{V}$ . Again, the time taken for the inductor to charge is five times the time constant of the circuit  $(\tau = L / R)$ ,

$$
t_\mathrm{charge} = 5\frac{L}{R} \tag{7.67}
$$

Since at steady state,  $i$  is constant,  $\frac{di}{dt} = 0$ , and the inductor voltage  $\nu = 0$ . When the switch suddenly opens, a large voltage is developed across the inductor (due to the rapidly collapsing field) causing a spark or arc in the air gap. The spark continues until the energy stored in the inductor is dissipated in the spark discharge. In laboratories, when one is working with inductive circuits, this same effect causes a very nasty shock, and one must exercise caution.

A solenoid with resistance  $4\Omega$  and inductance  $6\mathrm{mH}$  is used in an automobile ignition circuit similar to that in Fig. 7.78. If the battery supplies  $12\mathrm{V}$ , determine: the final current through the solenoid when the switch is closed, the energy stored in the coil, and the voltage across the air gap, assuming that the switch takes  $1\mu \mathrm{s}$  to open.

# Solution:

The final current through the coil is

$$
I = \frac{V_s}{R} = \frac{12}{4} = 3\mathrm{A}
$$

The energy stored in the coil is

$$
W = \frac{1}{2} L I^{2} = \frac{1}{2}\times 6\times 10^{-3}\times 3^{2} = 27\mathrm{mJ}
$$

The voltage across the gap is

$$
V = L\frac{\Delta I}{\Delta t} = 6\times 10^{-3}\times \frac{3}{1\times 10^{-6}} = 18\mathrm{kV}
$$

The spark coil of an automobile ignition system has a  $20 - \mathrm{mH}$  inductance and a  $5 - \Omega$  resistance. With a supply voltage of  $12\mathrm{V}$ , calculate: the time needed for the coil to fully charge, the energy stored in the coil, and the voltage developed at the spark gap if the switch opens in  $2\mu \mathrm{s}$ .

Answer:  $20\mathrm{ms}$ ,  $57.6\mathrm{mJ}$ , and  $24\mathrm{kV}$ .

# 7.10 Summary

1. The analysis in this chapter is applicable to any circuit that can be reduced to an equivalent circuit comprising a resistor and a single energy-storage element (inductor or capacitor). Such a circuit is first-order because its behavior is described by a first-order differential equation. When analyzing  $RC$  and  $RL$  circuits, one must always keep in mind that the capacitor is an open circuit to steady-state dc conditions while the inductor is a short circuit to steady-state dc conditions.

2. The natural response is obtained when no independent source is present. It has the general form

$$
x(t) = x(0)e^{-t / \tau}
$$

where  $x$  represents current through (or voltage across) a resistor, a capacitor, or an inductor, and  $x(0)$  is the initial value of  $x$ . Because most practical resistors, capacitors, and inductors always have losses, the natural response is a transient response, i.e. it dies out with time.

3. The time constant  $\tau$  is the time required for a response to decay to  $1 / \mathrm{e}$  of its initial value. For  $RC$  circuits,  $\tau = RC$  and for  $RL$  circuits,  $\tau = L / R$ .

4. The singularity functions include the unit step, the unit ramp function, and the unit impulse functions. The unit step function  $u(t)$  is

$$
u(t) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}0, & t< 0\\ 1, & t > 0 \end{array} \right.
$$

The unit impulse function is

$$
\delta(t)=\left\{\begin{array}{l l}{0,}&{\quad t< 0}\\ {\mathrm{U n d e f i n e d},}&{\quad t=0}\\ {0,}&{\quad t>0}\end{array}\right.
$$

The unit ramp function is

$$
r(t) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}0, & t\leq 0\\ t, & t\geq 0 \end{array} \right.
$$

5. The steady-state response is the behavior of the circuit after an independent source has been applied for a long time. The transient response is the component of the complete response that dies out with time.

6. The total or complete response consists of the steady-state response and the transient response.

7. The step response is the response of the circuit to a sudden application of a dc current or voltage. Finding the step response of a first-order circuit requires the initial value  $x(0^{+})$ , the final value  $x(\infty)$ , and the time constant  $\tau$ . With these three items, we obtain the step response as

$$
x(t) = x(\infty) + [x(0^{+}) - x(\infty)]e^{-t / \tau}
$$

A more general form of this equation is

$$
x(t) = x(\infty) + [x(t_{0}^{+}) - x(\infty)]e^{-(t - t_{0}) / \tau}
$$

Or we may write it as

Instantaneous value  $=$  Final  $^+$  [Initial - Final]e- (t- t)/

8. PSpice is very useful for obtaining the transient response of a circuit.

9. Four practical applications of  $RC$  and  $RL$  circuits are: a delay circuit, a photoflash unit, a relay circuit, and an automobile ignition circuit.

Assume that the capacitor is charged and then set aside by itself.

# Comprehensive Problems

7.88 The circuit in Fig. 7.148(a) can be designed as an approximate differentiator or an integrator, depending on whether the output is taken across the resistor or the capacitor, and also on the time constant  $\tau = RC$  of the circuit and the width  $T$  of the input pulse in Fig. 7.148(b). The circuit is a differentiator if  $\tau \ll T$ , say  $\tau < 0.1T$ , or an integrator if  $\tau \gg T$ , say  $\tau > 10T$ .

(a) What is the minimum pulse width that will allow a differentiator output to appear across the capacitor? 
(b) If the output is to be an integrated form of the input, what is the maximum value the pulse width can assume?

# Second-Order Circuits

Everyone who can earn a masters degree in engineering must earn a masters degree in engineering in order to maximize the success of their career! If you want to do research, state- of- the- art engineering, teach in a university, or start your own business, you really need to earn a doctoral degree!

—Charles K. Alexander

# Enhancing Your Career

To increase your engineering career opportunities after graduation, develop a strong fundamental understanding in a broad set of engineering areas. When possible, this might best be accomplished by working toward a graduate degree immediately upon receiving your undergraduate degree.

Each degree in engineering represents certain skills the student acquires. At the Bachelor degree level, you learn the language of engineering and the fundamentals of engineering and design. At the Master's level, you acquire the ability to do advanced engineering projects and to communicate your work effectively both orally and in writing. The Ph.D. represents a thorough understanding of the fundamentals of electrical engineering and a mastery of the skills necessary both for working at the frontiers of an engineering area and for communicating one's effort to others.

If you have no idea what career you should pursue after graduation, a graduate degree program will enhance your ability to explore career options. Since your undergraduate degree will only provide you with the fundamentals of engineering, a Master's degree in engineering supplemented by business courses benefits more engineering students than does getting a Master's of Business Administration (MBA). The best time to get your MBA is after you have been a practicing engineer for some years and decide your career path would be enhanced by strengthening your business skills.

Engineers should constantly educate themselves, formally and informally, taking advantage of all means of education. Perhaps there is no better way to enhance your career than to join a professional society such as IEEE and be an active member.

# 8.1 Introduction

In the previous chapter we considered circuits with a single storage element (a capacitor or an inductor). Such circuits are first- order because the differential equations describing them are first- order. In this chapter we will consider circuits containing two storage elements. These are known as second- order circuits because their responses are described by differential equations that contain second derivatives.

Typical examples of second- order circuits are  $RLC$  circuits, in which the three kinds of passive elements are present. Examples of such circuits are shown in Fig. 8.1(a) and (b). Other examples are  $RL$  and  $RC$  circuits, as shown in Fig. 8.1(c) and (d). It is apparent from Fig. 8.1 that a second- order circuit may have two storage elements of different type or the same type (provided elements of the same type cannot be represented by an equivalent single element). An op amp circuit with two storage elements may also be a second- order circuit. As with first- order circuits, a second- order circuit may contain several resistors and dependent and independent sources.

A second- order circuit is characterized by a second- order differential equation. It consists of resistors and the equivalent of two energy storage elements.

Our analysis of second- order circuits will be similar to that used for first- order. We will first consider circuits that are excited by the initial conditions of the storage elements. Although these circuits may contain dependent sources, they are free of independent sources. These source- free circuits will give natural responses as expected. Later we will consider circuits that are excited by independent sources. These circuits will give both the transient response and the steady- state response. We consider only dc independent sources in this chapter. The case of sinusoidal and exponential sources is deferred to later chapters.

We begin by learning how to obtain the initial conditions for the circuit variables and their derivatives, as this is crucial to analyzing second- order circuits. Then we consider series and parallel  $RLC$  circuits such as shown in Fig. 8.1 for the two cases of excitation: by initial

conditions of the energy storage elements and by step inputs. Later we examine other types of second- order circuits, including op amp circuits. We will consider PSpice analysis of second- order circuits. Finally, we will consider the automobile ignition system and smoothing circuits as typical applications of the circuits treated in this chapter. Other applications such as resonant circuits and filters will be covered in Chapter 14.

# 8.2 Finding Initial and Final Values

Perhaps the major problem students face in handling second- order circuits is finding the initial and final conditions on circuit variables. Students are usually comfortable getting the initial and final values of  $\nu$  and  $i$  but often have difficulty finding the initial values of their derivatives:  $d\nu /dt$  and  $di / dt$ . For this reason, this section is explicitly devoted to the subtleties of getting  $\nu (0)$ ,  $i(0)$ ,  $d\nu (0) / dt$ ,  $di(0) / dt$ ,  $i(\infty)$ , and  $\nu (\infty)$ . Unless otherwise stated in this chapter,  $\nu$  denotes capacitor voltage, while  $i$  is the inductor current.

There are two key points to keep in mind in determining the initial conditions.

First—as always in circuit analysis—we must carefully handle the polarity of voltage  $\nu (t)$  across the capacitor and the direction of the current  $i(t)$  through the inductor. Keep in mind that  $\nu$  and  $i$  are defined strictly according to the passive sign convention (see Figs. 6.3 and 6.23). One should carefully observe how these are defined and apply them accordingly.

Second, keep in mind that the capacitor voltage is always continuous so that

$$
\nu (0^{+}) = \nu (0^{-}) \tag{8.1a}
$$

and the inductor current is always continuous so that

$$
i(0^{+}) = i(0^{-}) \tag{8.1b}
$$

where  $t = 0^{- }$  denotes the time just before a switching event and  $t = 0^{+}$  is the time just after the switching event, assuming that the switching event takes place at  $t = 0$ .

Thus, in finding initial conditions, we first focus on those variables that cannot change abruptly, capacitor voltage and inductor current, by applying Eq. (8.1). The following examples illustrate these ideas.

The switch in Fig. 8.2 has been closed for a long time. It is open at  $t = 0$ . Find: (a)  $i(0^{+})$ ,  $\nu (0^{+})$ , (b)  $di(0^{+}) / dt$ ,  $d\nu (0^{+}) / dt$ , (c)  $i(\infty)$ ,  $\nu (\infty)$ .

# Solution:

(a) If the switch is closed a long time before  $t = 0$ , it means that the circuit has reached dc steady state at  $t = 0$ . At dc steady state, the inductor acts like a short circuit, while the capacitor acts like an open circuit, so we have the circuit in Fig. 8.3(a) at  $t = 0^{-}$ . Thus,

$$
i(0^{-}) = \frac{12}{4 + 2} = 2\mathrm{A},\qquad \nu (0^{-}) = 2i(0^{-}) = 4\mathrm{V}
$$

# Figure 8.3

Equivalent circuit of that in Fig. 8.2 for: (a)  $t = 0^{- }$ , (b)  $t = 0^{+}$ , (c)  $t \rightarrow \infty$ .

As the inductor current and the capacitor voltage cannot change abruptly,

$$
i(0^{+}) = i(0^{-}) = 2\mathrm{A},\qquad \nu (0^{+}) = \nu (0^{-}) = 4\mathrm{V}
$$

(b) At  $t = 0^{+}$ , the switch is open; the equivalent circuit is as shown in Fig. 8.3(b). The same current flows through both the inductor and capacitor. Hence,

$$
i_{C}(0^{+}) = i(0^{+}) = 2\mathrm{A}
$$

Since  $C d\nu /d t = i_{C},d\nu /d t = i_{C} / C,$  and

$$
\frac{d\nu(0^{+})}{d t} = \frac{i_{C}(0^{+})}{C} = \frac{2}{0.1} = 20 \mathrm{V / s}
$$

Similarly, since  $L d / d t = \nu_{L},d i / d t = \nu_{L} / L$  We now obtain  $\nu_{L}$  by applying KVL to the loop in Fig. 8.3(b). The result is

$$
-12 + 4i(0^{+}) + \nu_{L}(0^{+}) + \nu (0^{+}) = 0
$$

or

$$
\nu_{L}(0^{+}) = 12 - 8 - 4 = 0
$$

Thus,

$$
\frac{d i(0^{+})}{d t} = \frac{\nu_{L}(0^{+})}{L} = \frac{0}{0.25} = 0 \mathrm{A / s}
$$

(c) For  $t > 0$ , the circuit undergoes transience. But as  $t \rightarrow \infty$ , the circuit reaches steady state again. The inductor acts like a short circuit and the capacitor like an open circuit, so that the circuit in Fig. 8.3(b) becomes that shown in Fig. 8.3(c), from which we have

$$
i(\infty) = 0\mathrm{A},\qquad \nu (\infty) = 12\mathrm{V}
$$

# Practice Problem 8.1

The switch in Fig. 8.4 was open for a long time but closed at  $t = 0$ . Determine: (a)  $i(0^{+}), \nu (0^{+})$ , (b)  $d i(0^{+}) / d t, d \nu (0^{+}) / d t$ , (c)  $i(\infty), \nu (\infty)$ .

In the circuit of Fig. 8.5, calculate: (a)  $i_{L}(0^{+})$ ,  $\nu_{C}(0^{+})$ ,  $\nu_{R}(0^{+})$ , (b)  $d i_{L}(0^{+}) / d t$ ,  $d\nu_{C}(0^{+}) / d t$ ,  $d\nu_{R}(0^{+}) / d t$ , (c)  $i_{L}(\infty)$ ,  $\nu_{C}(\infty)$ ,  $\nu_{R}(\infty)$ .

Figure 8.5 For Example 8.2.

# Solution:

(a) For  $t < 0$ ,  $3u(t) = 0$ . At  $t = 0^{-}$ , since the circuit has reached steady state, the inductor can be replaced by a short circuit, while the capacitor is replaced by an open circuit as shown in Fig. 8.6(a). From this figure we obtain

$$
i_{L}(0^{-}) = 0, \qquad \nu_{R}(0^{-}) = 0, \qquad \nu_{C}(0^{-}) = -20 \mathrm{~V} \tag{8.2.1}
$$

Although the derivatives of these quantities at  $t = 0^{- }$  are not required, it is evident that they are all zero, since the circuit has reached steady state and nothing changes.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-13/c95faf42-d8e0-4f06-a665-945fc5e108f1/a1f266c645f94f76288dffdb298bb8592ec0337134b5aa4b9e87edcf32ae1f3b.jpg)  
Figure 8.6

The circuit in Fig. 8.5 for: (a)  $t = 0^{- }$ , (b)  $t = 0^{+}$ .

For  $t > 0$ ,  $3u(t) = 3$ , so that the circuit is now equivalent to that in Fig. 8.6(b). Since the inductor current and capacitor voltage cannot change abruptly,

$$
i_{L}(0^{+}) = i_{L}(0^{-}) = 0, \qquad \nu_{C}(0^{+}) = \nu_{C}(0^{-}) = -20 \mathrm{~V} \tag{8.2.2}
$$

Although the voltage across the  $4 - \Omega$  resistor is not required, we will use it to apply KVL and KCL; let it be called  $\nu_{o}$ . Applying KCL at node  $a$  in Fig. 8.6(b) gives

$$
3 = \frac{\nu_{R}(0^{+})}{2} + \frac{\nu_{o}(0^{+})}{4} \tag{8.2.3}
$$

Applying KVL to the middle mesh in Fig. 8.6(b) yields

$$
-\nu_{R}(0^{+}) + \nu_{o}(0^{+}) + \nu_{C}(0^{+}) + 20 = 0 \tag{8.2.4}
$$

Since  $\nu_{C}(0^{+}) = - 20 \mathrm{V}$  from Eq. (8.2.2), Eq. (8.2.4) implies that

$$
\nu_{R}(0^{+}) = \nu_{o}(0^{+}) \tag{8.2.5}
$$

From Eqs. (8.2.3) and (8.2.5), we obtain

$$
\nu_{R}(0^{+}) = \nu_{o}(0^{+}) = 4 \mathrm{V} \tag{8.2.6}
$$

(b) Since  $L d i_{L} / d t = \nu_{L}$

$$
\frac{d i_{L}(0^{+})}{d t} = \frac{\nu_{L}(0^{+})}{L}
$$

But applying KVL to the right mesh in Fig. 8.6(b) gives

$$
\nu_{L}(0^{+}) = \nu_{C}(0^{+}) + 20 = 0
$$

Hence,

$$
\frac{d i_{L}(0^{+})}{d t} = 0 \tag{8.2.7}
$$

Similarly, since  $C d\nu_{C} / d t = i_{C}$ , then  $d\nu_{C} / d t = i_{C} / C$ . We apply KCL at node  $b$  in Fig. 8.6(b) to get  $i_{C}$ :

$$
\frac{\nu_{o}(0^{+})}{4} = i_{C}(0^{+}) + i_{L}(0^{+}) \tag{8.2.8}
$$

Since  $\nu_{o}(0^{+}) = 4$  and  $i_{L}(0^{+}) = 0$ ,  $i_{C}(0^{+}) = 4 / 4 = 1$  A. Then

$$
\frac{d\nu_{C}(0^{+})}{d t} = \frac{i_{C}(0^{+})}{C} = \frac{1}{0.5} = 2 \mathrm{V / s} \tag{8.2.9}
$$

To get  $d\nu_{R}(0^{+}) / d t$ , we apply KCL to node  $a$  and obtain

$$
3 = \frac{\nu_{R}}{2} + \frac{\nu_{o}}{4}
$$

Taking the derivative of each term and setting  $t = 0^{+}$  gives

$$
0 = 2 \frac{d\nu_{R}(0^{+})}{d t} + \frac{d\nu_{o}(0^{+})}{d t} \tag{8.2.10}
$$

We also apply KVL to the middle mesh in Fig. 8.6(b) and obtain

$$
-\nu_{R} + \nu_{C} + 20 + \nu_{o} = 0
$$

Again, taking the derivative of each term and setting  $t = 0^{+}$  yields

$$
-\frac{d\nu_{R}(0^{+})}{d t} + \frac{d\nu_{C}(0^{+})}{d t} + \frac{d\nu_{o}(0^{+})}{d t} = 0
$$

Substituting for  $d\nu_{C}(0^{+}) / d t = 2$  gives

$$
\frac{d\nu_{R}(0^{+})}{d t} = 2 + \frac{d\nu_{o}(0^{+})}{d t} \tag{8.2.11}
$$

From Eqs. (8.2.10) and (8.2.11), we get

$$
\frac{d\nu_{R}(0^{+})}{d t} = \frac{2}{3} \mathrm{V / s}
$$

We can find  $d i_{R}(0^{+}) / d t$  although it is not required. Since  $\nu_{R} = 2i_{R}$

$$
\frac{d i_{R}(0^{+})}{d t} = \frac{1}{2}\frac{d\nu_{R}(0^{+})}{d t} = \frac{1}{2}\frac{2}{3} = \frac{1}{3}\mathrm{A} / \mathrm{s}
$$

(c) As  $t\to \infty$  , the circuit reaches steady state. We have the equivalent circuit in Fig. 8.6(a) except that the 3-A current source is now operative. By current division principle,

$$
i_{L}(\infty) = \frac{2}{2 + 4} 3\mathrm{A} = 1\mathrm{A} \tag{8.2.12}
$$

$$
\nu_{R}(\infty) = \frac{4}{2 + 4} 3\mathrm{A}\times 2 = 4\mathrm{V},\qquad \nu_{C}(\infty) = -20\mathrm{V} \tag{8.2.12}
$$

For the circuit in Fig. 8.7, find: (a)  $i_{L}(0^{+})$ $\nu_{C}(0^{+})$ $\nu_{R}(0^{+})$  (b)  $d i_{L}(0^{+}) / d t,d\nu_{C}(0^{+}) / d t,d\nu_{R}(0^{+}) / d t,$  (c)  $i_{L}(\infty)$ $\nu_{C}(\infty)$ $\nu_{R}(\infty)$

# 8.3 The Source-Free Series RLC Circuit

An understanding of the natural response of the series RLC circuit is a necessary background for future studies in filter design and communications networks.

Consider the series RLC circuit shown in Fig. 8.8. The circuit is being excited by the energy initially stored in the capacitor and inductor. The energy is represented by the initial capacitor voltage  $V_{0}$  and initial inductor current  $I_{0}$  . Thus, at  $t = 0$

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{\nu(0)=\frac{1}{C}\int_{-\infty}^{0}i d t=V_{0}}}\\ {{i(0)=I_{0}}}\end{array} \tag{8.2b}
$$

Applying KVL around the loop in Fig. 8.8,

$$
R i + L\frac{d i}{d t} +\frac{1}{C}\int_{-\infty}^{t}i(\tau)d\tau = 0 \tag{8.3}
$$

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-13/c95faf42-d8e0-4f06-a665-945fc5e108f1/c6b72de4419441f1758b556d6bc1362d8590f52b95e82d8b095db42a2384c2ab.jpg)  
Figure 8.8 A source-free series RLC circuit.

To eliminate the integral, we differentiate with respect to  $t$  and rearrange terms. We get

$$
\frac{d^{2}i}{d t^{2}} +\frac{R}{L}\frac{d i}{d t} +\frac{i}{L C} = 0 \tag{8.4}
$$

This is a second- order differential equation and is the reason for calling the RLC circuits in this chapter second- order circuits. Our goal is to solve Eq. (8.4). To solve such a second- order differential equation requires that we have two initial conditions, such as the initial value of  $i$  and its first derivative or initial values of some  $i$  and  $v$ . The initial value of  $i$  is given in Eq. (8.2b). We get the initial value of the derivative of  $i$  from Eqs. (8.2a) and (8.3); that is,

$$
R i(0) + L\frac{d i(0)}{d t} +V_{0} = 0
$$

or

$$
\frac{d i(0)}{d t} = -\frac{1}{L} (R I_{0} + V_{0}) \tag{8.5}
$$

With the two initial conditions in Eqs. (8.2b) and (8.5), we can now solve Eq. (8.4). Our experience in the preceding chapter on first- order circuits suggests that the solution is of exponential form. So we let

$$
i = A e^{s t} \tag{8.6}
$$

where  $A$  and  $s$  are constants to be determined. Substituting Eq. (8.6) into Eq. (8.4) and carrying out the necessary differentiations, we obtain

$$
A s^{2}e^{s t} + \frac{A R}{L} s e^{s t} + \frac{A}{L C} e^{s t} = 0
$$

or

$$
A e^{s t}\Big(s^{2} + \frac{R}{L} s + \frac{1}{L C}\Big) = 0 \tag{8.7}
$$

Since  $i = A e^{s t}$  is the assumed solution we are trying to find, only the expression in parentheses can be zero:

$$
s^{2} + \frac{R}{L} s + \frac{1}{L C} = 0 \tag{8.8}
$$

This quadratic equation is known as the characteristic equation of the differential Eq. (8.4), since the roots of the equation dictate the character of  $i$ . The two roots of Eq. (8.8) are

$$
\begin{array}{l}{{s_{1}=-\frac{R}{2L}+\sqrt{\left(\frac{R}{2L}\right)^{2}-\frac{1}{L C}}}}\\ {{s_{2}=-\frac{R}{2L}-\sqrt{\left(\frac{R}{2L}\right)^{2}-\frac{1}{L C}}}}\end{array} \tag{8.9b}
$$

A more compact way of expressing the roots is

$$
s_{1} = -\alpha +\sqrt{\alpha^{2} - \omega_{0}^{2}},\qquad s_{2} = -\alpha -\sqrt{\alpha^{2} - \omega_{0}^{2}} \tag{8.10}
$$

where

$$
\alpha = \frac{R}{2L},\qquad \omega_{0} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{L C}} \tag{8.11}
$$

The roots  $s_{1}$  and  $s_{2}$  are called natural frequencies, measured in nepers per second  $(\mathrm{Np / s})$  , because they are associated with the natural response of the circuit;  $\omega_{0}$  is known as the resonant frequency or strictly as the undamped natural frequency, expressed in radians per second  $(\mathrm{rad / s})$  , and  $\alpha$  is the neper frequency expressed in nepers per second. In terms of  $\alpha$  and  $\omega_{0}$  Eq. (8.8) can be written as

$$
s^{2} + 2\alpha s + \omega_{0}^{2} = 0 \tag{8.8a}
$$

The variables  $s$  and  $\omega_{0}$  are important quantities we will be discussing throughout the rest of the text.

The two values of  $s$  in Eq. (8.10) indicate that there are two possible solutions for  $i$ , each of which is of the form of the assumed solution in Eq. (8.6); that is,

$$
i_{1} = A_{1}e^{s_{1}t},\qquad i_{2} = A_{2}e^{s_{2}t} \tag{8.12}
$$

Since Eq. (8.4) is a linear equation, any linear combination of the two distinct solutions  $i_{1}$  and  $i_{2}$  is also a solution of Eq. (8.4). A complete or total solution of Eq. (8.4) would therefore require a linear combination of  $i_{1}$  and  $i_{2}$ . Thus, the natural response of the series  $RLC$  circuit is

$$
i(t) = A_{1}e^{s_{1}t} + A_{2}e^{s_{2}t} \tag{8.13}
$$

where the constants  $A_{1}$  and  $A_{2}$  are determined from the initial values  $i(0)$  and  $di(0) / dt$  in Eqs. (8.2b) and (8.5).

From Eq. (8.10), we can infer that there are three types of solutions:

1. If  $\alpha > \omega_{0}$ , we have the overdamped case.

2. If  $\alpha = \omega_{0}$ , we have the critically damped case.

3. If  $\alpha < \omega_{0}$ , we have the underdamped case.

We will consider each of these cases separately.

# Overdamped Case  $(\alpha > \omega_{0})$

From Eqs. (8.9) and (8.10),  $\alpha > \omega_{0}$  implies  $C > 4L / R^{2}$ . When this happens, both roots  $s_{1}$  and  $s_{2}$  are negative and real. The response is

$$
i(t) = A_{1}e^{s_{1}t} + A_{2}e^{s_{2}t} \tag{8.14}
$$

which decays and approaches zero as  $t$  increases. Figure 8.9(a) illustrates a typical overdamped response.

# Critically Damped Case  $(\alpha = \omega_{0})$

When  $\alpha = \omega_{0}$ ,  $C = 4L / R^{2}$  and

$$
s_{1} = s_{2} = -\alpha = -\frac{R}{2L} \tag{8.15}
$$

The neper (Np) is a dimensionless unit named after John Napier (1550- 1617), a Scottish mathematician.

The ratio  $\alpha / \omega_{0}$  is known as the damping ratio  $\zeta$ .

The response is overdamped when the roots of the circuit's characteristic equation are unequal and real, critically damped when the roots are equal and real, and underdamped when the roots are complex.

Figure 8.9 (a) Overdamped response, (b) critically damped response, (c) underdamped response.

For this case, Eq. (8.13) yields

$$
i(t) = A_{1}e^{-\alpha t} + A_{2}e^{-\alpha t} = A_{3}e^{-\alpha t}
$$

where  $A_{3} = A_{1} + A_{2}$ . This cannot be the solution, because the two initial conditions cannot be satisfied with the single constant  $A_{3}$ . What then could be wrong? Our assumption of an exponential solution is incorrect for the special case of critical damping. Let us go back to Eq. (8.4). When  $\alpha = \omega_{0} = R / 2L$ , Eq. (8.4) becomes

$$
\frac{d^{2}i}{dt^{2}} + 2\alpha \frac{di}{dt} + \alpha^{2}i = 0
$$

or

$$
\frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{di}{dt} + \alpha i\right) + \alpha \left(\frac{di}{dt} + \alpha i\right) = 0 \tag{8.16}
$$

If we let

$$
f = \frac{di}{dt} + \alpha i \tag{8.17}
$$

then Eq. (8.16) becomes

$$
\frac{df}{dt} + \alpha f = 0
$$

which is a first- order differential equation with solution  $f = A_{1}e^{- \alpha t}$ , where  $A_{1}$  is a constant. Equation (8.17) then becomes

$$
\frac{di}{dt} + \alpha i = A_{1}e^{-\alpha t}
$$

or

$$
e^{\alpha t}\frac{di}{dt} + e^{\alpha t}\alpha i = A_{1} \tag{8.18}
$$

This can be written as

$$
\frac{d}{dt} (e^{\alpha t}i) = A_{1} \tag{8.19}
$$

Integrating both sides yields

$$
e^{\alpha t}i = A_{1}t + A_{2}
$$

or

$$
i = (A_{1}t + A_{2})e^{-\alpha t} \tag{8.20}
$$

where  $A_{2}$  is another constant. Hence, the natural response of the critically damped circuit is a sum of two terms: a negative exponential and a negative exponential multiplied by a linear term, or

$$
i(t) = (A_{2} + A_{1}t)e^{-\alpha t} \tag{8.21}
$$

A typical critically damped response is shown in Fig. 8.9(b). In fact, Fig. 8.9(b) is a sketch of  $i(t) = t e^{- \alpha t}$ , which reaches a maximum value of  $e^{- 1} / \alpha$  at  $t = 1 / \alpha$ , one time constant, and then decays all the way to zero.

# Underdamped Case  $(\alpha < \omega_{0})$

For  $\alpha < \omega_{0}$ $C< 4L / R^{2}$  . The roots may be written as

$$
\begin{array}{l}{{s_{1}=-\alpha+\sqrt{-(\omega_{0}^{2}-\alpha^{2})}=-\alpha+j\omega_{d}}}\\ {{s_{2}=-\alpha-\sqrt{-(\omega_{0}^{2}-\alpha^{2})}=-\alpha-j\omega_{d}}}\end{array} \tag{8.22b}
$$

where  $j = \sqrt{- 1}$  and  $\omega_{d} = \sqrt{\omega_{0}^{2} - \alpha^{2}}$  , which is called the damped frequency. Both  $\omega_{0}$  and  $\omega_{d}$  are natural frequencies because they help determine the natural response; while  $\omega_{0}$  is often called the undamped natural frequency,  $\omega_{d}$  is called the damped natural frequency. The natural response is

$$
\begin{array}{r l} & {i(t) = A_{1}e^{-(\alpha -j\omega_{d})t} + A_{2}e^{-(\alpha +j\omega_{d})t}}\\ & {\qquad = e^{-\alpha t}(A_{1}e^{-j\omega_{d}t} + A_{2}e^{-j\omega_{d}t})} \end{array} \tag{8.23}
$$

Using Euler's identities,

$$
e^{j\theta} = \cos \theta +j\sin \theta ,\qquad e^{-j\theta} = \cos \theta -j\sin \theta \tag{8.24}
$$

we get

$$
\begin{array}{r l} & {i(t) = e^{-\alpha t}[A_{1}(\cos \omega_{d}t + j\sin \omega_{d}t) + A_{2}(\cos \omega_{d}t - j\sin \omega_{d}t)]}\\ & {\qquad = e^{-\alpha t}[(A_{1} + A_{2})\cos \omega_{d}t + j(A_{1} - A_{2})\sin \omega_{d}t]} \end{array} \tag{8.25}
$$

Replacing constants  $(A_{1} + A_{2})$  and  $j(A_{1} - A_{2})$  with constants  $B_{1}$  and  $B_{2}$  ,we write

$$
\boxed{i(t) = e^{-\alpha t}(B_{1}\cos \omega_{d}t + B_{2}\sin \omega_{d}t)} \tag{8.26}
$$

With the presence of sine and cosine functions, it is clear that the natural response for this case is exponentially damped and oscillatory in nature. The response has a time constant of  $1 / \alpha$  and a period of  $T = 2\pi /\omega_{d}$  . Figure 8.9(c) depicts a typical underdamped response. Part (a) and (b) of Fig. 8.9 assume for each case that  $i(0) = 0$

Once the inductor current  $i(t)$  is found for the  $RLC$  series circuit as shown above, other circuit quantities such as individual element voltages can easily be found. For example, the resistor voltage is  $\nu_{R} = R i$  and the inductor voltage is  $\nu_{L} = L d i / d t$  . The inductor current  $i(t)$  is selected as the key variable to be determined first in order to take advantage of Eq. (8.1b).

We conclude this section by noting the following interesting, peculiar properties of an  $RLC$  network:

1. The behavior of such a network is captured by the idea of damping, which is the gradual loss of the initial stored energy, as evidenced by the continuous decrease in the amplitude of the response. The damping effect is due to the presence of resistance  $R$  . The neper frequency  $\alpha$  determines the rate at which the response is damped. If  $R = 0$  , then  $\alpha = 0$  , and we have an  $LC$  circuit with  $1 / \sqrt{LC}$  as the undamped natural frequency. Since  $\alpha < \omega_{0}$  in this case, the response is not only undamped but also oscillatory. The circuit is said to be loss-less, because the dissipating or damping element  $(R)$  is absent. By adjusting the value of  $R$  , the response may be made undamped, overdamped, critically damped, or underdamped.

2. Oscillatory response is possible due to the presence of the two types of storage elements. Having both  $L$  and  $C$  allows the flow of

$R = 0$  produces a perfectly sinusoidal response. This response cannot be practically accomplished with  $L$  and  $C$  because of the inherent losses in them. See Figs 6.8 and 6.26. An electronic device called an oscillator can produce a perfectly sinusoidal response.

Examples 8.5 and 8.7 demonstrate the effect of varying  $R$

The response of a second- order circuit with two storage elements of the same type, as in Fig. 8.1(c) and (d), cannot be oscillatory.

energy back and forth between the two. The damped oscillation exhibited by the underdamped response is known as ringing. It stems from the ability of the storage elements  $L$  and  $C$  to transfer energy back and forth between them.

3. Observe from Fig. 8.9 that the waveforms of the responses differ. In general, it is difficult to tell from the waveforms the difference between the overdamped and critically damped responses. The critically damped case is the borderline between the underdamped and overdamped cases and it decays the fastest. With the same initial conditions, the overdamped case has the longest settling time, because it takes the longest time to dissipate the initial stored energy. If we desire the response that approaches the final value most rapidly without oscillation or ringing, the critically damped circuit is the right choice.

What this means in most practical circuits is that we seek an overdamped circuit that is as close as possible to a critically damped circuit.

# Example 8.3

In Fig. 8.8,  $R = 40 \Omega$ ,  $L = 4 \mathrm{H}$ , and  $C = 1 / 4 \mathrm{F}$ . Calculate the characteristic roots of the circuit. Is the natural response overdamped, underdamped, or critically damped?

# Solution:

We first calculate

$$
\alpha = \frac{R}{2L} = \frac{40}{2(4)} = 5, \qquad \omega_0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{4 \times \frac{1}{4}}} = 1
$$

The roots are

$$
s_{12} = -\alpha \pm \sqrt{\alpha^2 - \omega_0^2} = -5 \pm \sqrt{25 - 1}
$$

or

$$
s_1 = -0.101, \qquad s_2 = -9.899
$$

Since  $\alpha > \omega_0$ , we conclude that the response is overdamped. This is also evident from the fact that the roots are real and negative.

# Practice Problem 8.3

If  $R = 10 \Omega$ ,  $L = 5 \mathrm{H}$ , and  $C = 2 \mathrm{mF}$  in Fig. 8.8, find  $\alpha$ ,  $\omega_0$ ,  $s_1$ , and  $s_2$ . What type of natural response will the circuit have?

Answer: 1, 10,  $- 1 \pm j9.95$ , underdamped.

# Example 8.4

Find  $i(t)$  in the circuit of Fig. 8.10. Assume that the circuit has reached steady state at  $t = 0^{- }$ .

# Solution:

For  $t < 0$ , the switch is closed. The capacitor acts like an open circuit while the inductor acts like a shunted circuit. The equivalent circuit is shown in Fig. 8.11(a). Thus, at  $t = 0$ ,

$$
i(0) = \frac{10}{4 + 6} = 1 \mathrm{A}, \qquad \nu (0) = 6i(0) = 6 \mathrm{V}
$$

Figure 8.11 The circuit in Fig. 8.10: (a) for  $t < 0$ , (b) for  $t > 0$ .

where  $i(0)$  is the initial current through the inductor and  $\nu (0)$  is the initial voltage across the capacitor.

For  $t > 0$ , the switch is opened and the voltage source is disconnected. The equivalent circuit is shown in Fig. 8.11(b), which is a source- free series  $RLC$  circuit. Notice that the  $3 - \Omega$  and  $6 - \Omega$  resistors, which are in series in Fig. 8.10 when the switch is opened, have been combined to give  $R = 9 \Omega$  in Fig. 8.11(b). The roots are calculated as follows:

$$
\alpha = \frac{R}{2L} = \frac{9}{2\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)} = 9, \qquad \omega_0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2}}} = 10
$$

$$
s_{1,2} = -\alpha \pm \sqrt{\alpha^2 - \omega_0^2} = -9 \pm \sqrt{81 - 100}
$$

or

$$
s_{1,2} = -9 \pm j4.359
$$

Hence, the response is underdamped  $(\alpha < \omega)$ ; that is,

$$
i(t) = e^{-9t} (A_1 \cos 4.359t + A_2 \sin 4.359t) \tag{8.4.1}
$$

We now obtain  $A_1$  and  $A_2$  using the initial conditions. At  $t = 0$

$$
i(0) = 1 = A_1 \tag{8.4.2}
$$

From Eq. (8.5),

$$
\left. \frac{di}{dt} \right|_{t = 0} = -\frac{1}{L} [Ri(0) + \nu (0)] = -2[9(1) - 6] = -6 \mathrm{A / s} \tag{8.4.3}
$$

Note that  $\nu (0) = V_0 = - 6 \mathrm{V}$  is used, because the polarity of  $\nu$  in Fig. 8.11(b) is opposite that in Fig. 8.8. Taking the derivative of  $i(t)$  in Eq. (8.4.1),

$$
\begin{array}{r l} & {\frac{d i}{d t} = -9e^{-9t}(A_{1}\cos 4.359t + A_{2}\sin 4.359t)}\\ & {\qquad +e^{-9t}(4.359)(-A_{1}\sin 4.359t + A_{2}\cos 4.359t)} \end{array}
$$

Imposing the condition in Eq. (8.4.3) at  $t = 0$  gives

$$
-6 = -9(A_1 + 0) + 4.359 (-0 + A_2)
$$

But  $A_1 = 1$  from Eq. (8.4.2). Then

$$
-6 = -9 + 4.359A_2 \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad A_2 = 0.6882
$$

Substituting the values of  $A_1$  and  $A_2$  in Eq. (8.4.1) yields the complete solution as

$$
i(t) = e^{-9t} (\cos 4.359t + 0.6882 \sin 4.359t) \mathrm{A}
$$

# 8.4 The Source-Free Parallel RLC Circuit

Parallel RLC circuits find many practical applications, notably in communications networks and filter designs.

Consider the parallel RLC circuit shown in Fig. 8.13. Assume initial inductor current  $I_0$  and initial capacitor voltage  $V_0$ ,

$$
\begin{array}{l} i(0) = I_0 = \frac{1}{L} \int_{-\infty}^{0} \nu (t) dt \\ \nu (0) = V_0 \end{array} \tag{8.27b}
$$

Because the three elements are in parallel, they have the same voltage  $\nu$  across them. According to passive sign convention, the current is entering each element; that is, the current through each element is leaving the top node. Thus, applying KCL at the top node gives

$$
\frac{\nu}{R} + \frac{1}{L} \int_{-\infty}^{t} \nu (\tau) d\tau + C \frac{d\nu}{dt} = 0 \tag{8.28}
$$

Taking the derivative with respect to  $t$  and dividing by  $C$  results in

$$
\frac{d^2\nu}{dt^2} + \frac{1}{RC} \frac{d\nu}{dt} + \frac{1}{LC} \nu = 0 \tag{8.29}
$$

We obtain the characteristic equation by replacing the first derivative by  $s$  and the second derivative by  $s^2$ . By following the same reasoning used in establishing Eqs. (8.4) through (8.8), the characteristic equation is obtained as

$$
s^2 + \frac{1}{RC} s + \frac{1}{LC} = 0 \tag{8.30}
$$

The roots of the characteristic equation are

$$
s_{1,2} = -\frac{1}{2RC} \pm \sqrt{\left(\frac{1}{2RC}\right)^2 - \frac{1}{LC}}
$$

or

$$
s_{1,2} = -\alpha \pm \sqrt{\alpha^2 - \omega_0^2} \tag{8.31}
$$

where

$$
\alpha = \frac{1}{2RC}, \qquad \omega_0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}} \tag{8.32}
$$

The names of these terms remain the same as in the preceding section, as they play the same role in the solution. Again, there are three possible solutions, depending on whether  $\alpha > \omega_{0}$ ,  $\alpha = \omega_{0}$ , or  $\alpha < \omega_{0}$ . Let us consider these cases separately.

# Overdamped Case  $(\alpha > \omega_{0})$

From Eq. (8.32),  $\alpha > \omega_{0}$  when  $L > 4R^{2}C$ . The roots of the characteristic equation are real and negative. The response is

$$
\nu (t) = A_{1}e^{s_{1}t} + A_{2}e^{s_{2}t} \tag{8.33}
$$

# Critically Damped Case  $(\alpha = \omega_{0})$

For  $\alpha = \omega_{0}$ ,  $L = 4R^{2}C$ . The roots are real and equal so that the response is

$$
\nu (t) = (A_{1} + A_{2}t)e^{-\alpha t} \tag{8.34}
$$

# Underdamped Case  $(\alpha < \omega_{0})$

When  $\alpha < \omega_{0}$ ,  $L < 4R^{2}C$ . In this case the roots are complex and may be expressed as

$$
s_{1,2} = -\alpha \pm j\omega_{d} \tag{8.35}
$$

where

$$
\omega_{d} = \sqrt{\omega_{0}^{2} - \alpha^{2}} \tag{8.36}
$$

The response is

$$
\nu (t) = e^{-\alpha t}(A_{1}\cos \omega_{d}t + A_{2}\sin \omega_{d}t) \tag{8.37}
$$

The constants  $A_{1}$  and  $A_{2}$  in each case can be determined from the initial conditions. We need  $\nu (0)$  and  $d\nu (0) / dt$ . The first term is known from Eq. (8.27b). We find the second term by combining Eqs. (8.27) and (8.28), as

$$
\frac{V_{0}}{R} +I_{0} + C\frac{d\nu(0)}{dt} = 0
$$

or

$$
\frac{d\nu(0)}{dt} = -\frac{(V_{0} + RI_{0})}{RC} \tag{8.38}
$$

The voltage waveforms are similar to those shown in Fig. 8.9 and will depend on whether the circuit is overdamped, underdamped, or critically damped.

Having found the capacitor voltage  $\nu (t)$  for the parallel  $RLC$  circuit as shown above, we can readily obtain other circuit quantities such as individual element currents. For example, the resistor current is  $i_{R} = \nu /R$  and the capacitor current is  $i_{C} = C d\nu /dt$ . We have selected the capacitor voltage  $\nu (t)$  as the key variable to be determined first in order to take advantage of Eq. (8.1a). Notice that we first found the inductor current  $t(t)$  for the  $RLC$  series circuit, whereas we first found the capacitor voltage  $\nu (t)$  for the parallel  $RLC$  circuit.

# Example 8.5

In the parallel circuit of Fig. 8.13, find  $\nu (t)$  for  $t > 0$ , assuming  $\nu (0) = 5 \mathrm{~V}$ ,  $i(0) = 0$ ,  $L = 1 \mathrm{H}$ , and  $C = 10 \mathrm{mF}$ . Consider these cases:  $R = 1.923 \Omega$ ,  $R = 5 \Omega$ , and  $R = 6.25 \Omega$ .

# Solution:

CASE1 If  $R = 1.923 \Omega$ ,

$$
\alpha = \frac{1}{2RC} = \frac{1}{2 \times 1.923 \times 10 \times 10^{-3}} = 26
$$

$$
\omega_{0} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 \times 10 \times 10^{-3}}} = 10
$$

Since  $\alpha > \omega_{0}$  in this case, the response is overdamped. The roots of the characteristic equation are

$$
s_{1,2} = -\alpha \pm \sqrt{\alpha^{2} - \omega_{0}^{2}} = -2, - 50
$$

and the corresponding response is

$$
\nu (t) = A_{1}e^{-2t} + A_{2}e^{-50t} \tag{8.5.1}
$$

We now apply the initial conditions to get  $A_{1}$  and  $A_{2}$ .

$$
\nu (0) = 5 = A_{1} + A_{2} \tag{8.5.2}
$$

$$
\frac{d\nu(0)}{dt} = \frac{\nu(0) + Ri(0)}{RC} = \frac{5 + 0}{1.923 \times 10 \times 10^{-3}} = -260
$$

But differentiating Eq. (8.5.1),

$$
\frac{d\nu}{dt} = -2A_{1}e^{-2t} - 50A_{2}e^{-50t}
$$

At  $t = 0$

$$
-260 = -2A_{1} - 50A_{2} \tag{8.5.3}
$$

From Eqs. (8.5.2) and (8.5.3), we obtain  $A_{1} = - 0.2083$  and  $A_{2} = 5.208$ . Substituting  $A_{1}$  and  $A_{2}$  in Eq. (8.5.1) yields

$$
\nu (t) = -0.2083e^{-2t} + 5.208e^{-50t} \tag{8.5.4}
$$

CASE2 When  $R = 5 \Omega$ ,

$$
\alpha = \frac{1}{2RC} = \frac{1}{2 \times 5 \times 10 \times 10^{-3}} = 10
$$

while  $\omega_{0} = 10$  remains the same. Since  $\alpha = \omega_{0} = 10$ , the response is critically damped. Hence,  $s_{1} = s_{2} = - 10$ , and

$$
\nu (t) = (A_{1} + A_{2}t)e^{-10t} \tag{8.5.5}
$$

To get  $A_{1}$  and  $A_{2}$ , we apply the initial conditions

$$
\nu (0) = 5 = A_{1} \tag{8.5.6}
$$

$$
\frac{d\nu(0)}{dt} = -\frac{\nu(0) + Ri(0)}{RC} = -\frac{5 + 0}{5 \times 10 \times 10^{-3}} = -100
$$

But differentiating Eq. (8.5.5),

$$
\frac{d\nu}{dt} = (-10A_{1} - 10A_{2}t + A_{2})e^{-10t}
$$

At  $t = 0$ ,

$$
-100 = -10A_{1} + A_{2} \tag{8.5.7}
$$

From Eqs. (8.5.6) and (8.5.7),  $A_{1} = 5$  and  $A_{2} = - 50$ . Thus,

$$
\nu (t) = (5 - 50t)e^{-10t}\mathrm{V} \tag{8.5.8}
$$

CASE 3 When  $R = 6.25\Omega$ ,

$$
\alpha = \frac{1}{2RC} = \frac{1}{2\times 6.25\times 10\times 10^{-3}} = 8
$$

while  $\omega_{0} = 10$  remains the same. As  $\alpha < \omega_{0}$  in this case, the response is underdamped. The roots of the characteristic equation are

$$
s_{1,2} = -\alpha \pm \sqrt{\alpha^{2} - \omega_{0}^{2}} = -8\pm j6
$$

Hence,

$$
\nu (t) = (A_{1}\cos 6t + A_{2}\sin 6t)e^{-8t} \tag{8.5.9}
$$

We now obtain  $A_{1}$  and  $A_{2}$ , as

$$
\nu (0) = 5 = A_{1} \tag{8.5.10}
$$

$$
\frac{dv(0)}{dt} = -\frac{\nu(0) + Ri(0)}{RC} = -\frac{5 + 0}{6.25\times 10\times 10^{-3}} = -80
$$

But differentiating Eq. (8.5.9),

$$
\frac{d\nu}{dt} = (-8A_{1}\cos 6t - 8A_{2}\sin 6t - 6A_{1}\sin 6t + 6A_{2}\cos 6t)e^{-8t}
$$

At  $t = 0$ ,

$$
-80 = -8A_{1} + 6A_{2} \tag{8.5.11}
$$

From Eqs. (8.5.10) and (8.5.11),  $A_{1} = 5$  and  $A_{2} = - 6.667$ . Thus,

$$
\nu (t) = (5\cos 6t - 6.667\sin 6t)e^{-8t} \tag{8.5.12}
$$

Notice that by increasing the value of  $R$ , the degree of damping decreases and the responses differ. Figure 8.14 plots the three cases.

Figure 8.15 For Example 8.6.

# Solution:

When  $t< 0$ , the switch is open; the inductor acts like a short circuit while the capacitor behaves like an open circuit. The initial voltage across the capacitor is the same as the voltage across the  $50 - \Omega$  resistor; that is,

$$
\nu (0) = \frac{50}{30 + 50} (40) = \frac{5}{8}\times 40 = 25\mathrm{~V~} \tag{8.6.1}
$$

The initial current through the inductor is

$$
i(0) = -\frac{40}{30 + 50} = -0.5\mathrm{~A~}
$$

The direction of  $i$  is as indicated in Fig. 8.15 to conform with the direction of  $I_{0}$  in Fig. 8.13, which is in agreement with the convention that current flows into the positive terminal of an inductor (see Fig. 6.23). We need to express this in terms of  $d\nu /dt$ , since we are looking for  $\nu$ .

$$
\frac{d\nu(0)}{dt} = -\frac{\nu(0) + Ri(0)}{RC} = -\frac{25 - 50\times 0.5}{50\times 20\times 10^{-6}} = 0 \tag{8.6.2}
$$

When  $t > 0$ , the switch is closed. The voltage source along with the  $30 - \Omega$  resistor is separated from the rest of the circuit. The parallel  $RLC$  circuit acts independently of the voltage source, as illustrated in Fig. 8.16. Next, we determine that the roots of the characteristic equation are

$$
\alpha = \frac{1}{2RC} = \frac{1}{2\times 50\times 20\times 10^{-6}} = 500
$$

$$
\omega_{0} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}} = \frac{1}{0.4\times 20\times 10^{-6}} = 354
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l}{s_{1,2} = -\alpha \pm \sqrt{\alpha^{2} - \omega_{0}^{2}}}\\ {= -500\pm \sqrt{250,000 - 124,997.6} = -500\pm 354} \end{array}
$$

or

$$
s_{1} = -854,\qquad s_{2} = -146
$$

The circuit in Fig. 8.15 when  $t > 0$ . The parallel  $RLC$  circuit on the right- hand side acts independently of the circuit on the left- hand side of the junction.

Since  $\alpha > \omega_0$ , we have the overdamped response

$$
\nu (t) = A_1 e^{-854t} + A_2 e^{-146t} \tag{8.6.3}
$$

At  $t = 0$ , we impose the condition in Eq. (8.6.1),

$$
\nu (0) = 25 = A_1 + A_2 \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad A_2 = 25 - A_1 \tag{8.6.4}
$$

Taking the derivative of  $\nu (t)$  in Eq. (8.6.3),

$$
\frac{d\nu}{dt} = -854A_1 e^{-854t} - 146A_2 e^{-146t}
$$

Imposing the condition in Eq. (8.6.2),

$$
\frac{d\nu(0)}{dt} = 0 = -854A_1 - 146A_2
$$

or

$$
0 = 854A_1 + 146A_2 \tag{8.6.5}
$$

Solving Eqs. (8.6.4) and (8.6.5) gives

$$
A_1 = -5.156, \qquad A_2 = 30.16
$$

Thus, the complete solution in Eq. (8.6.3) becomes

$$
\nu (t) = -5.156 e^{-854t} + 30.16 e^{-146t} \mathrm{~V}
$$

Figure 8.18 Step voltage applied to a series  $RLC$  circuit.

Substituting for  $i$  in Eq. (8.39) and rearranging terms,

$$
\frac{d^2\nu}{dt^2} +\frac{R}{L}\frac{d\nu}{dt} +\frac{\nu}{LC} = \frac{V_s}{LC} \tag{8.40}
$$

which has the same form as Eq. (8.4). More specifically, the coefficients are the same (and that is important in determining the frequency parameters) but the variable is different. (Likewise, see Eq. (8.47).) Hence, the characteristic equation for the series  $RLC$  circuit is not affected by the presence of the dc source.

The solution to Eq. (8.40) has two components: the transient response  $\nu_{t}(t)$  and the steady- state response  $\nu_{ss}(t)$ ; that is,

$$
\nu (t) = \nu_{t}(t) + \nu_{ss}(t) \tag{8.41}
$$

The transient response  $\nu_{t}(t)$  is the component of the total response that dies out with time. The form of the transient response is the same as the form of the solution obtained in Section 8.3 for the source- free circuit, given by Eqs. (8.14), (8.21), and (8.26). Therefore, the transient response  $\nu_{t}(t)$  for the overdamped, underdamped, and critically damped cases are:

$$
\begin{array}{c}{\nu_{t}(t) = A_{1}e^{s_{1}t} + A_{2}e^{s_{2}t}\qquad \mathrm{(Overdamped)}}\\ {\nu_{t}(t) = (A_{1} + A_{2}t)e^{-\alpha t}\qquad \mathrm{(Critically~damped)}}\\ {\nu_{t}(t) = (A_{1}\cos \omega_{d}t + A_{2}\sin \omega_{d}t)e^{-\alpha t}\qquad \mathrm{(Underdamped)}} \end{array} \tag{8.42b}
$$

The steady- state response is the final value of  $\nu (t)$ . In the circuit in Fig. 8.18, the final value of the capacitor voltage is the same as the source voltage  $V_{s}$ . Hence,

$$
\nu_{ss}(t) = \nu (\infty) = V_s \tag{8.43}
$$

Thus, the complete solutions for the overdamped, underdamped, and critically damped cases are:

$$
\nu (t) = V_{s} + A_{1}e^{s_{1}t} + A_{2}e^{s_{2}t}\qquad \mathrm{(Overdamped)} \tag{8.44a}
$$

$$
\nu (t) = V_{s} + (A_{1} + A_{2}t)e^{-\alpha t}\qquad \mathrm{(Critically~damped)} \tag{8.44b}
$$

$$
\nu (t) = V_{s} + (A_{1}\cos \omega_{d}t + A_{2}\sin \omega_{d}t)e^{-\alpha t}\quad \mathrm{(Underdamped)} \tag{8.44c}
$$

The values of the constants  $A_{1}$  and  $A_{2}$  are obtained from the initial conditions:  $\nu (0)$  and  $d\nu (0) / dt$ . Keep in mind that  $\nu$  and  $i$  are, respectively, the voltage across the capacitor and the current through the inductor. Therefore, Eq. (8.44) only applies for finding  $\nu$ . But once the capacitor voltage  $\nu_{C} = \nu$  is known, we can determine  $i = C d\nu /dt$ , which is the same current through the capacitor, inductor, and resistor. Hence, the voltage across the resistor is  $\nu_{R} = iR$ , while the inductor voltage is  $\nu_{L} = L d i / d t$ .

Alternatively, the complete response for any variable  $x(t)$  can be found directly, because it has the general form

$$
x(t) = x_{ss}(t) + x_{t}(t) \tag{8.45}
$$

where the  $x_{ss} = x(\infty)$  is the final value and  $x_{t}(t)$  is the transient response. The final value is found as in Section 8.2. The transient response has the same form as in Eq. (8.42), and the associated constants are determined from Eq. (8.44) based on the values of  $x(0)$  and  $d x(0) / d t$ .

For the circuit in Fig. 8.19, find  $\nu (t)$  and  $i(t)$  for  $t > 0$ . Consider these cases:  $R = 5\Omega$ ,  $R = 4\Omega$ , and  $R = 1\Omega$ .

# Solution:

CASE 1 When  $R = 5\Omega$ . For  $t< 0$ , the switch is closed for a long time. The capacitor behaves like an open circuit while the inductor acts like a short circuit. The initial current through the inductor is

$$
i(0) = \frac{24}{5 + 1} = 4\mathrm{A}
$$

and the initial voltage across the capacitor is the same as the voltage across the  $1 - \Omega$  resistor; that is,

$$
\nu (0) = 1i(0) = 4\mathrm{V}
$$

For  $t > 0$ , the switch is opened, so that we have the  $1 - \Omega$  resistor disconnected. What remains is the series  $RLC$  circuit with the voltage source. The characteristic roots are determined as follows:

$$
\alpha = \frac{R}{2L} = \frac{5}{2\times 1} = 2.5,\qquad \omega_0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1\times 0.25}} = 2
$$

$$
s_{1,2} = -\alpha \pm \sqrt{\alpha^{2} - \omega_{0}^{2}} = -1, -4
$$

Since  $\alpha >\omega_{0}$ , we have the overdamped natural response. The total response is therefore

$$
\nu (t) = \nu_{ss} + (A_1e^{-t} + A_2e^{-4t})
$$

where  $\nu_{ss}$  is the steady- state response. It is the final value of the capacitor voltage. In Fig. 8.19,  $\nu_{f} = 24\mathrm{V}$ . Thus,

$$
\nu (t) = 24 + (A_1e^{-t} + A_2e^{-4t}) \tag{8.7.1}
$$

We now need to find  $A_{1}$  and  $A_{2}$  using the initial conditions.

$$
\nu (0) = 4 = 24 + A_{1} + A_{2}
$$

or

$$
-20 = A_{1} + A_{2} \tag{8.7.2}
$$

The current through the inductor cannot change abruptly and is the same current through the capacitor at  $t = 0^{+}$  because the inductor and capacitor are now in series. Hence,

$$
i(0) = C\frac{d\nu(0)}{dt} = 4\qquad \Rightarrow \qquad \frac{d\nu(0)}{dt} = \frac{4}{C} = \frac{4}{0.25} = 16
$$

Before we use this condition, we need to take the derivative of  $\nu$  in Eq. (8.7.1).

$$
\frac{d\nu}{dt} = -A_1e^{-t} - 4A_2e^{-4t} \tag{8.7.3}
$$

At  $t = 0$

$$
\frac{d\nu(0)}{dt} = 16 = -A_1 - 4A_2 \tag{8.7.4}
$$

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-13/c95faf42-d8e0-4f06-a665-945fc5e108f1/61d8794804bdb80a4fad5fa3d63056f63dcc9564fa04b06592f6469475042325.jpg)  
Figure 8.19 For Example 8.7.

From Eqs. (8.7.2) and (8.7.4),  $A_{1} = - 64 / 3$  and  $A_{2} = 4 / 3$ . Substituting  $A_{1}$  and  $A_{2}$  in Eq. (8.7.1), we get

$$
\nu (t) = 24 + \frac{4}{3} (-16e^{-t} + e^{-4t}) \mathrm{V} \tag{8.7.5}
$$

Since the inductor and capacitor are in series for  $t > 0$ , the inductor current is the same as the capacitor current. Hence,

$$
i(t) = C \frac{d\nu}{dt}
$$

Multiplying Eq. (8.7.3) by  $C = 0.25$  and substituting the values of  $A_{1}$  and  $A_{2}$  gives

$$
i(t) = \frac{4}{3} (4e^{-t} - e^{-4t}) \mathrm{A} \tag{8.7.6}
$$

Note that  $i(0) = 4 \mathrm{A}$ , as expected.

CASE 2 When  $R = 4 \Omega$ . Again, the initial current through the inductor is

$$
i(0) = \frac{24}{4 + 1} = 4.8 \mathrm{A}
$$

and the initial capacitor voltage is

$$
\nu (0) = 1i(0) = 4.8 \mathrm{V}
$$

For the characteristic roots,

$$
\alpha = \frac{R}{2L} = \frac{4}{2 \times 1} = 2
$$

while  $\omega_{0} = 2$  remains the same. In this case,  $s_{1} = s_{2} = - \alpha = - 2$ , and we have the critically damped natural response. The total response is therefore

$$
\nu (t) = \nu_{ss} + (A_{1} + A_{2}t) e^{-2t}
$$

and, as before  $\nu_{ss} = 24 \mathrm{V}$

$$
\nu (t) = 24 + (A_{1} + A_{2}t) e^{-2t} \tag{8.7.7}
$$

To find  $A_{1}$  and  $A_{2}$ , we use the initial conditions. We write

$$
\nu (0) = 4.8 = 24 + A_{1} \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad A_{1} = -19.2 \tag{8.7.8}
$$

Since  $i(0) = C \frac{d\nu(0)}{dt} = 4.8$  or

$$
\frac{d\nu(0)}{dt} = \frac{4.8}{C} = 19.2
$$

From Eq. (8.7.7),

$$
\frac{d\nu}{dt} = (-2A_{1} - 2tA_{2} + A_{2}) e^{-2t} \tag{8.7.9}
$$

At  $t = 0$

$$
\frac{d\nu(0)}{dt} = 19.2 = -2A_{1} + A_{2} \tag{8.7.10}
$$

From Eqs. (8.7.8) and (8.7.10),  $A_{1} = - 19.2$  and  $A_{2} = - 19.2$ . Thus, Eq. (8.7.7) becomes

$$
\nu (t) = 24 - 19.2(1 + t)e^{-2t}\mathrm{V} \tag{8.7.11}
$$

The inductor current is the same as the capacitor current; that is,

$$
i(t) = C\frac{d\nu}{dt}
$$

Multiplying Eq. (8.7.9) by  $C = 0.25$  and substituting the values of  $A_{1}$  and  $A_{2}$  gives

$$
i(t) = (4.8 + 9.6t)e^{-2t}\mathrm{A} \tag{8.7.12}
$$

Note that  $i(0) = 4.8\mathrm{A}$ , as expected.

CASE 3 When  $R = 1\Omega$ . The initial inductor current is

$$
i(0) = \frac{24}{1 + 1} = 12\mathrm{A}
$$

and the initial voltage across the capacitor is the same as the voltage across the  $1 - \Omega$  resistor,

$$
\begin{array}{c}\nu (0) = 1i(0) = 12\mathrm{V} \\ \alpha = \frac{R}{2L} = \frac{1}{2\times 1} = 0.5 \end{array}
$$

Since  $\alpha = 0.5< \alpha_{0} = 2$ , we have the underdamped response

$$
s_{1,2} = -\alpha \pm \sqrt{\alpha^{2} - \omega_{0}^{2}} = -0.5\pm j1.936
$$

The total response is therefore

$$
\nu (t) = 24 + (A_{1}\cos 1.936t + A_{2}\sin 1.936t)e^{-0.5t} \tag{8.7.13}
$$

We now determine  $A_{1}$  and  $A_{2}$ . We write

$$
\nu (0) = 12 = 24 + A_{1}\qquad \Rightarrow \qquad A_{1} = -12 \tag{8.7.14}
$$

Since  $i(0) = Cd\nu (0) / dt = 12$

$$
\frac{d\nu(0)}{dt} = \frac{12}{C} = 48 \tag{8.7.15}
$$

But

$$
\frac{d\nu}{dt} = e^{-0.5t}(-1.936A_{1}\sin 1.936t + 1.936A_{2}\cos 1.936t)
$$

$$
-0.5e^{-0.5t}(A_{1}\cos 1.936t + A_{2}\sin 1.936t) \tag{8.7.16}
$$

At  $t = 0$

$$
\frac{d\nu(0)}{dt} = 48 = (-0 + 1.936A_{2}) - 0.5(A_{1} + 0)
$$

Substituting  $A_{1} = - 12$  gives  $A_{2} = 21.694$ , and Eq. (8.7.13) becomes

$$
\nu (t) = 24 + (21.694\sin 1.936t - 12\cos 1.936t)e^{-0.5t}\mathrm{V} \tag{8.7.17}
$$

The inductor current is

$$
i(t) = C\frac{d\nu}{dt}
$$

Multiplying Eq. (8.7.16) by  $C = 0.25$  and substituting the values of  $A_{1}$  and  $A_{2}$  gives

$$
i(t) = (3.1\sin 1.936t + 12\cos 1.936t)e^{-0.5t}\mathrm{A} \tag{8.7.18}
$$

Note that  $i(0) = 12\mathrm{A}$ , as expected.

Figure 8.20 plots the responses for the three cases. From this figure, we observe that the critically damped response approaches the step input of  $24\mathrm{V}$  the fastest.

\frac{\nu}{R} +i + C\frac{d\nu}{dt} = I_{s} \tag{8.46}
$$

But

$$
\nu = L\frac{d i}{d t}
$$

Substituting for  $\nu$  in Eq. (8.46) and dividing by  $LC$ , we get

$$
\frac{d^2i}{dt^2} +\frac{1}{RC}\frac{di}{dt} +\frac{i}{LC} = \frac{I_s}{LC} \tag{8.47}
$$

which has the same characteristic equation as Eq. (8.29).

The complete solution to Eq. (8.47) consists of the transient response  $i_{t}(t)$  and the steady- state response  $i_{ss}$ ; that is,

$$
i(t) = i_{t}(t) + i_{ss}(t) \tag{8.48}
$$

The transient response is the same as what we had in Section 8.4. The steady- state response is the final value of  $i$ . In the circuit in Fig. 8.22, the final value of the current through the inductor is the same as the source current  $I_{s}$ . Thus,

$$
\begin{array}{c}{i(t) = I_s + A_1e^{s_1t} + A_2e^{s_2t}\quad \mathrm{(Overdamped)}}\\ {i(t) = I_s + (A_1 + A_2t)e^{-at}\quad \mathrm{(Critically~damped)}}\\ {i(t) = I_s + (A_1\cos \omega_dt + A_2\sin \omega_dt)e^{-at}\quad \mathrm{(Underdamped)}} \end{array} \tag{8.49}
$$

The constants  $A_{1}$  and  $A_{2}$  in each case can be determined from the initial conditions for  $i$  and  $di / dt$ . Again, we should keep in mind that Eq. (8.49) only applies for finding the inductor current  $i$ . But once the inductor current  $i_{L} = i$  is known, we can find  $\nu = L di / dt$ , which is the same voltage across inductor, capacitor, and resistor. Hence, the current through the resistor is  $i_{R} = \nu /R$ , while the capacitor current is  $i_{C} = C dv / dt$ . Alternatively, the complete response for any variable  $x(t)$  may be found directly, using

$$
x(t) = x_{ss}(t) + x_{t}(t) \tag{8.50}
$$

where  $x_{ss}$  and  $x_{t}$  are its final value and transient response, respectively.

In the circuit of Fig. 8.23, find  $i(t)$  and  $i_{R}(t)$  for  $t > 0$ .

# Solution:

For  $t < 0$ , the switch is open, and the circuit is partitioned into two independent subcircuits. The 4- A current flows through the inductor, so that

$$
i(0) = 4\mathrm{A}
$$

Since  $30u(- t) = 30$  when  $t< 0$  and 0 when  $t > 0$  , the voltage source is operative for  $t< 0$  . The capacitor acts like an open circuit and the voltage across it is the same as the voltage across the  $20 - \Omega$  resistor connected in parallel with it. By voltage division, the initial capacitor voltage is

$$
\nu (0) = \frac{20}{20 + 20} (30) = 15 \mathrm{~V}
$$

For  $t > 0$  , the switch is closed, and we have a parallel RLC circuit with a current source. The voltage source is zero which means it acts like a short- circuit. The two  $20 - \Omega$  resistors are now in parallel. They are combined to give  $R = 20\parallel 20 = 10\Omega$  . The characteristic roots are determined as follows:

$$
\alpha = \frac{1}{2RC} = \frac{1}{2\times 10\times 8\times 10^{-3}} = 6.25
$$

$$
w_{0} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{20\times 8\times 10^{-3}}} = 2.5
$$

$$
s_{1,2} = -\alpha \pm \sqrt{\alpha^{2} - \omega_{0}^{2}} = -6.25\pm \sqrt{39.0625 - 6.25} = -6.25\pm 5.7282
$$

or

$$
s_{1} = -11.978,\qquad s_{2} = -0.5218
$$

Since  $\alpha >\omega_{0}$  , we have the overdamped case. Hence,

$$
i(t) = I_{s} + A_{1}e^{-11.978t} + A_{2}e^{-0.5218t} \tag{8.8.1}
$$

where  $I_{s} = 4$  is the final value of  $i(t)$  . We now use the initial conditions to determine  $A_{1}$  and  $A_{2}$  . At  $t = 0$

$$
i(0) = 4 = 4 + A_{1} + A_{2}\qquad \Rightarrow \qquad A_{2} = -A_{1} \tag{8.8.2}
$$

Taking the derivative of  $i(t)$  in Eq. (8.8.1),

$$
\frac{d i}{d t} = -11.978A_{1}e^{-11.978t} - 0.5218A_{2}e^{-0.5218t}
$$

so that at  $t = 0$

$$
\frac{d i(0)}{d t} = -11.978A_{1} - 0.5218A_{2} \tag{8.8.3}
$$

But

$$
L\frac{d i(0)}{d t} = \nu (0) = 15\qquad \Rightarrow \qquad \frac{d i(0)}{d t} = \frac{15}{L} = \frac{15}{20} = 0.75
$$

Substituting this into Eq. (8.8.3) and incorporating Eq. (8.8.2), we get

$$
0.75 = (11.978 - 0.5218)A_{2}\qquad \Rightarrow \qquad A_{2} = 0.0655
$$

Thus,  $A_{1} = - 0.0655$  and  $A_{2} = 0.0655$  . Inserting  $A_{1}$  and  $A_{2}$  in Eq. (8.8.1) gives the complete solution as

$$
i(t) = 4 + 0.0655(e^{-0.5218t} - e^{-11.978t})\mathrm{~A~}
$$

From  $i(t)$  , we obtain  $\nu (t) = L d i / d t$  and

$$
i_{R}(t) = \frac{\nu(t)}{20} = \frac{L}{20}\frac{d i}{d t} = 0.785e^{-11.978t} - 0.0342e^{-0.5218t}\mathrm{~A~}
$$

Answer:  $10(1 - \cos (0.25t))$  A,  $50\sin (0.25t)$  V.

# 8.7 General Second-Order Circuits

Now that we have mastered series and parallel  $RLC$  circuits, we are prepared to apply the ideas to any second- order circuit having one or more independent sources with constant values. Although the series and parallel  $RLC$  circuits are the second- order circuits of greatest interest, other second- order circuits including op amps are also useful. Given a second- order circuit, we determine its step response  $x(t)$  (which may be voltage or current) by taking the following four steps:

1. We first determine the initial conditions  $x(0)$  and  $d x(0) / d t$  and the final value  $x(\infty)$  , as discussed in Section 8.2.

2. We turn off the independent sources and find the form of the transient response  $x_{t}(t)$  by applying KCL and KVL. Once a second-order differential equation is obtained, we determine its characteristic roots. Depending on whether the response is overdamped, critically damped, or underdamped, we obtain  $x_{t}(t)$  with two unknown constants as we did in the previous sections.

3. We obtain the steady-state response as

$$
x_{s s}(t) = x(\infty) \tag{8.51}
$$

where  $x(\infty)$  is the final value of  $x$  , obtained in step 1.

4. The total response is now found as the sum of the transient response and steady-state response

$$
x(t) = x_{t}(t) + x_{s s}(t) \tag{8.52}
$$

We finally determine the constants associated with the transient response by imposing the initial conditions  $x(0)$  and  $d x(0) / d t$  determined in step 1.

We can apply this general procedure to find the step response of any second- order circuit, including those with op amps. The following examples illustrate the four steps.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-13/c95faf42-d8e0-4f06-a665-945fc5e108f1/03d310d855118d275b2adaa11b8e362efe1e305684bc6cb235dc47e7b2b52ff3.jpg)  
Figure 8.24 For Practice Prob. 8.8.

Figure 8.24 For Practice Prob. 8.8. A circuit may look complicated at first. But once the sources are turned off in an attempt to find the form of the transient response, it may be reducible to a first- order circuit, when the storage elements can be combined, or to a parallel/series  $RLC$  circuit. If it is reducible to a first- order circuit, the solution becomes simply what we had in Chapter 7. If it is reducible to a parallel or series  $RLC$  circuit, we apply the techniques of previous sections in this chapter.

Find the complete response  $\nu$  and then  $i$  for  $t > 0$  in the circuit of Fig. 8.25.

# Solution:

We first find the initial and final values. At  $t = 0^{- }$  , the circuit is at steady state. The switch is open; the equivalent circuit is shown in Fig. 8.26(a). It is evident from the figure that

$$
\nu (0^{-}) = 12 \mathrm{V},\qquad i(0^{-}) = 0
$$

At  $t = 0^{+}$  , the switch is closed; the equivalent circuit is in Fig. 8.26(b). By the continuity of capacitor voltage and inductor current, we know that

$$
\nu (0^{+}) = \nu (0^{-}) = 12 \mathrm{V},\qquad i(0^{+}) = i(0^{-}) = 0 \tag{8.9.1}
$$

Problems in this chapter can also be solved by using Laplace transforms, which are covered in Chapters 15 and 16.

Figure 8.27 Obtaining the form of the transient response for Example 8.9.

To get  $d\nu (0^{+}) / dt$ , we use  $C d\nu /dt = i_{C}$  or  $d\nu /dt = i_{C} / C$ . Applying KCL at node  $a$  in Fig. 8.26(b),

$$
i(0^{+}) = i_{C}(0^{+}) + \frac{\nu(0^{+})}{2}
$$

$$
0 = i_{C}(0^{+}) + \frac{12}{2} \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad i_{C}(0^{+}) = -6 \mathrm{~A}
$$

Hence,

$$
\frac{d\nu(0^{+})}{dt} = \frac{-6}{0.5} = -12 \mathrm{~V / s} \tag{8.9.2}
$$

The final values are obtained when the inductor is replaced by a short circuit and the capacitor by an open circuit in Fig. 8.26(b), giving

$$
i(\infty) = \frac{12}{4 + 2} = 2 \mathrm{~A}, \qquad \nu (\infty) = 2i(\infty) = 4 \mathrm{~V} \tag{8.9.3}
$$

Next, we obtain the form of the transient response for  $t > 0$ . By turning off the 12- V voltage source, we have the circuit in Fig. 8.27. Applying KCL at node  $a$  in Fig. 8.27 gives

$$
i = \frac{\nu}{2} + \frac{1}{2} \frac{d\nu}{dt} \tag{8.9.4}
$$

Applying KVL to the left mesh results in

$$
4i + 1 \frac{di}{dt} + \nu = 0 \tag{8.9.5}
$$

Since we are interested in  $\nu$  for the moment, we substitute  $i$  from Eq. (8.9.4) into Eq. (8.9.5). We obtain

$$
2\nu + 2 \frac{d\nu}{dt} + \frac{1}{2} \frac{d\nu}{dt} + \frac{1}{2} \frac{d^2\nu}{dt^2} + \nu = 0
$$

or

$$
\frac{d^2\nu}{dt^2} + 5 \frac{d\nu}{dt} + 6\nu = 0
$$

From this, we obtain the characteristic equation as

$$
s^2 + 5s + 6 = 0
$$

with roots  $s = - 2$  and  $s = - 3$ . Thus, the natural response is

$$
\nu_{n}(t) = Ae^{-2t} + Be^{-3t} \tag{8.9.6}
$$

where  $A$  and  $B$  are unknown constants to be determined later. The steady- state response is

$$
\nu_{ss}(t) = \nu (\infty) = 4 \tag{8.9.7}
$$

The complete response is

$$
\nu (t) = \nu_{t} + \nu_{ss} = 4 + Ae^{-2t} + Be^{-3t} \tag{8.9.8}
$$

We now determine  $A$  and  $B$  using the initial values. From Eq. (8.9.1),  $\nu (0) = 12$ . Substituting this into Eq. (8.9.8) at  $t = 0$  gives

$$
12 = 4 + A + B \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad A + B = 8 \tag{8.9.9}
$$

Taking the derivative of  $\nu$  in Eq. (8.9.8),

$$
\frac{d\nu}{dt} = -2Ae^{-2t} - 3Be^{-3t} \tag{8.9.10}
$$

Substituting Eq. (8.9.2) into Eq. (8.9.10) at  $t = 0$  gives

$$
-12 = -2A - 3B \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad 2A + 3B = 12 \tag{8.9.11}
$$

From Eqs. (8.9.9) and (8.9.11), we obtain

$$
A = 12, \qquad B = -4
$$

so that Eq. (8.9.8) becomes

$$
\nu (t) = 4 + 12e^{-2t} - 4e^{-3t}\mathrm{V},\qquad t > 0 \tag{8.9.12}
$$

From  $\nu$ , we can obtain other quantities of interest by referring to Fig. 8.26(b). To obtain  $i$ , for example,

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{i=\frac{\nu}{2}+\frac{1}{2}\frac{d\nu}{d t}=2+6e^{-2t}-2e^{-3t}-12e^{-2t}+6e^{-3t}}}\\ {{=2-6e^{-2t}+4e^{-3t}\mathrm{A},\qquad t>0}}\end{array} \tag{8.9.13}
$$

Notice that  $i(0) = 0$ , in agreement with Eq. (8.9.1).

Determine  $\nu$  and  $i$  for  $t > 0$  in the circuit of Fig. 8.28. (See comments about current sources in Practice Prob. 7.5. )

Figure 8.28 For Practice Prob. 8.9.

Find  $\nu_{o}(t)$  for  $t > 0$  in the circuit of Fig. 8.29.

# Solution:

This is an example of a second- order circuit with two inductors. We first obtain the mesh currents  $i_{1}$  and  $i_{2}$ , which happen to be the currents through the inductors. We need to obtain the initial and final values of these currents.

For  $t< 0$ ,  $7u(t) = 0$ , so that  $i_{1}(0^{- }) = 0 = i_{2}(0^{- })$ . For  $t > 0$ ,  $7u(t) = 7$ , so that the equivalent circuit is as shown in Fig. 8.30(a). Due to the continuity of inductor current,

$$
i_{1}(0^{+}) = i_{1}(0^{-}) = 0, \qquad i_{2}(0^{+}) = i_{2}(0^{-}) = 0 \tag{8.10.1}
$$

$$
\nu_{L2}(0^{+}) = \nu_{o}(0^{+}) = 1[(i_{1}(0^{+}) - i_{2}(0^{+})] = 0 \tag{8.10.2}
$$

Applying KVL to the left loop in Fig. 8.30(a) at  $t = 0^{+}$

$$
7 = 3i_{1}(0^{+}) + \nu_{L1}(0^{+}) + \nu_{o}(0^{+})
$$

or

$$
\nu_{L_{1}}(0^{+}) = 7 \mathrm{~V}
$$

Since  $L_{1} di_{1} / dt = \nu_{L_{1}}$ ,

$$
\frac{di_{1}(0^{+})}{dt} = \frac{\nu_{L_{1}}}{L_{1}} = \frac{7}{\frac{1}{2}} = 14 \mathrm{~A / s} \tag{8.10.3}
$$

Similarly, since  $L_{2} di_{2} / dt = \nu_{L_{2}}$ ,

$$
\frac{di_{2}(0^{+})}{dt} = \frac{\nu_{L_{2}}}{L_{2}} = 0 \tag{8.10.4}
$$

As  $t \to \infty$ , the circuit reaches steady state, and the inductors can be replaced by short circuits, as shown in Fig. 8.30(b). From this figure,

$$
i_{1}(\infty) = i_{2}(\infty) = \frac{7}{3} \mathrm{~A} \tag{8.10.5}
$$

Figure 8.31 Obtaining the form of the transient response for Example 8.10.

Next, we obtain the form of the transient responses by removing the voltage source, as shown in Fig. 8.31. Applying KVL to the two meshes yields

$$
4i_{1} - i_{2} + \frac{1}{2} \frac{di_{1}}{dt} = 0 \tag{8.10.6}
$$

and

$$
i_{2} + \frac{1}{5} \frac{di_{2}}{dt} - i_{1} = 0 \tag{8.10.7}
$$

From Eq. (8.10.6),

$$
i_{2} = 4i_{1} + \frac{1}{2} \frac{di_{1}}{dt} \tag{8.10.8}
$$

Substituting Eq. (8.10.8) into Eq. (8.10.7) gives

$$
4i_{1} + \frac{1}{2} \frac{di_{1}}{dt} + \frac{4}{5} \frac{di_{1}}{dt} + \frac{1}{10} \frac{d^{2}i_{1}}{dt^{2}} - i_{1} = 0
$$

$$
\frac{d^{2}i_{1}}{dt^{2}} + 13 \frac{di_{1}}{dt} + 30 i_{1} = 0
$$

From this we obtain the characteristic equation as

$$
s^{2} + 13s + 30 = 0
$$

which has roots  $s = - 3$  and  $s = - 10$ . Hence, the form of the transient response is

$$
i_{1n} = Ae^{-3t} + Be^{-10t} \tag{8.10.9}
$$

where  $A$  and  $B$  are constants. The steady- state response is

$$
i_{1ss} = i_{1}(\infty) = \frac{7}{3}\mathrm{A} \tag{8.10.10}
$$

From Eqs. (8.10.9) and (8.10.10), we obtain the complete response as

$$
i_{1}(t) = \frac{7}{3} +A e^{-3t} + B e^{-10t} \tag{8.10.11}
$$

We finally obtain  $A$  and  $B$  from the initial values. From Eqs. (8.10.1) and (8.10.11),

$$
0 = \frac{7}{3} +A + B \tag{8.10.12}
$$

Taking the derivative of Eq. (8.10.11), setting  $t = 0$  in the derivative, and enforcing Eq. (8.10.3), we obtain

$$
14 = -3A - 10B \tag{8.10.13}
$$

From Eqs. (8.10.12) and (8.10.13),  $A = - 4 / 3$  and  $B = - 1$ . Thus,

$$
i_{1}(t) = \frac{7}{3} -\frac{4}{3} e^{-3t} - e^{-10t} \tag{8.10.14}
$$

We now obtain  $i_{2}$  from  $i_{1}$ . Applying KVL to the left loop in Fig. 8.30(a) gives

$$
7 = 4i_{1} - i_{2} + \frac{1}{2}\frac{d i_{1}}{d t}\qquad \Rightarrow \qquad i_{2} = -7 + 4i_{1} + \frac{1}{2}\frac{d i_{1}}{d t}
$$

Substituting for  $i_{1}$  in Eq. (8.10.14) gives

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{i_{2}(t)=-7+\frac{28}{3}-\frac{16}{3}e^{-3t}-4e^{-10t}+2e^{-3t}+5e^{-10t}}}\\ {{=\frac{7}{3}-\frac{10}{3}e^{-3t}+e^{-10t}}}\end{array} \tag{8.10.15}
$$

From Fig. 8.29,

$$
\nu_{o}(t) = 1[i_{1}(t) - i_{2}(t)] \tag{8.10.16}
$$

Substituting Eqs. (8.10.14) and (8.10.15) into Eq. (8.10.16) yields

$$
\nu_{o}(t) = 2(e^{-3t} - e^{-10t}) \tag{8.10.17}
$$

Note that  $\nu_{o}(0) = 0$ , as expected from Eq. (8.10.2).

For  $t > 0$ , obtain  $\nu_{o}(t)$  in the circuit of Fig. 8.32. (Hint: First find  $\nu_{1}$  and  $\nu_{2}$ .)

Answer:  $8(e^{- t} - e^{- 6t})\mathrm{V},t > 0.$

The use of op amps in second- order circuits avoids the use of inductors, which are undesirable in some applications.

# 8.8 Second-Order Op Amp Circuits

An op amp circuit with two storage elements that cannot be combined into a single equivalent element is second- order. Because inductors are bulky and heavy, they are rarely used in practical op amp circuits. For this reason, we will only consider  $RC$  second- order op amp circuits here. Such circuits find a wide range of applications in devices such as filters and oscillators.The analysis of a second- order op amp circuit follows the same four steps given and demonstrated in the previous section.

In the op amp circuit of Fig. 8.33, find  $\nu_{o}(t)$  for  $t > 0$  when  $\nu_{s} = 10u(t)\mathrm{mV}$  Let  $R_{1} = R_{2} = 10\mathrm{k}\Omega$ $C_{1} = 20\mu \mathrm{F}$  , and  $C_{2} = 100\mu \mathrm{F}$

Figure 8.33 For Example 8.11.

# Solution:

Although we could follow the same four steps given in the previous section to solve this problem, we will solve it a little differently. Due to the voltage follower configuration, the voltage across  $C_{1}$  is  $\nu_{o}$  . Applying KCL at node 1,

$$
\frac{\nu_{s} - \nu_{1}}{R_{1}} = C_{2}\frac{d\nu_{2}}{dt} +\frac{\nu_{1} - \nu_{o}}{R_{2}} \tag{8.11.1}
$$

At node 2,KCL gives

$$
\frac{\nu_{1} - \nu_{o}}{R_{2}} = C_{1}\frac{d\nu_{o}}{dt} \tag{8.11.2}
$$

But

$$
\nu_{2} = \nu_{1} - \nu_{o} \tag{8.11.3}
$$

We now try to eliminate  $\nu_{1}$  and  $\nu_{2}$  in Eqs. (8.11.1) to (8.11.3). Substituting Eqs. (8.11.2) and (8.11.3) into Eq. (8.11.1) yields

$$
\frac{\nu_{s} - \nu_{1}}{R_{1}} = C_{2}\frac{d\nu_{1}}{dt} -C_{2}\frac{d\nu_{o}}{dt} +C_{1}\frac{d\nu_{o}}{dt} \tag{8.11.4}
$$

From Eq. (8.11.2),

$$
\nu_{1} = \nu_{o} + R_{2}C_{1}\frac{d\nu_{o}}{dt} \tag{8.11.5}
$$

Substituting Eq. (8.11.5) into Eq. (8.11.4), we obtain

$$
\frac{\nu_{s}}{R_{1}} = \frac{\nu_{o}}{R_{1}} +\frac{R_{2}C_{1}}{R_{1}}\frac{d\nu_{o}}{dt} +C_{2}\frac{d\nu_{o}}{dt} +R_{2}C_{1}C_{2}\frac{d^{2}\nu_{o}}{dt^{2}} -C_{2}\frac{d\nu_{o}}{dt} +C_{1}\frac{d\nu_{o}}{dt}
$$

or

$$
\frac{d^{2}\nu_{o}}{dt^{2}} +\left(\frac{1}{R_{1}C_{2}} +\frac{1}{R_{2}C_{2}}\right)\frac{d\nu_{o}}{dt} +\frac{\nu_{o}}{R_{1}R_{2}C_{1}C_{2}} = \frac{\nu_{s}}{R_{1}R_{2}C_{1}C_{2}} \tag{8.11.6}
$$

With the given values of  $R_{1}, R_{2}, C_{1}$ , and  $C_{2}$ , Eq. (8.11.6) becomes

$$
\frac{d^{2}\nu_{o}}{dt^{2}} +2\frac{d\nu_{o}}{dt} +5\nu_{o} = 5\nu_{s} \tag{8.11.7}
$$

To obtain the form of the transient response, set  $\nu_{s} = 0$  in Eq. (8.11.7), which is the same as turning off the source. The characteristic equation is

$$
s^{2} + 2s + 5 = 0
$$

which has complex roots  $s_{1,2} = - 1 \pm j2$ . Hence, the form of the transient response is

$$
\nu_{ot} = e^{-t}(A\cos 2t + B\sin 2t) \tag{8.11.8}
$$

where  $A$  and  $B$  are unknown constants to be determined.

As  $t \to \infty$ , the circuit reaches the steady- state condition, and the capacitors can be replaced by open circuits. Since no current flows through  $C_{1}$  and  $C_{2}$  under steady- state conditions and no current can enter the input terminals of the ideal op amp, current does not flow through  $R_{1}$  and  $R_{2}$ .

Thus,

$$
\nu_{o}(\infty) = \nu_{1}(\infty) = \nu_{s}
$$

The steady- state response is then

$$
\nu_{o s s} = \nu_{o}(\infty) = \nu_{s} = 10\mathrm{mV},\qquad t > 0 \tag{8.11.9}
$$

The complete response is

$$
\nu_{o}(t) = \nu_{o t} + \nu_{o s s} = 10 + e^{-t}(A\cos 2t + B\sin 2t)\mathrm{mV} \tag{8.11.10}
$$

To determine  $A$  and  $B$ , we need the initial conditions. For  $t < 0$ ,  $\nu_{s} = 0$ , so that

$$
\nu_{o}(0^{-}) = \nu_{2}(0^{-}) = 0
$$

For  $t > 0$ , the source is operative. However, due to capacitor voltage continuity,

$$
\nu_{o}(0^{+}) = \nu_{2}(0^{+}) = 0 \tag{8.11.11}
$$

From Eq. (8.11.3),

$$
\nu_{1}(0^{+}) = \nu_{2}(0^{+}) + \nu_{o}(0^{+}) = 0
$$

and, hence, from Eq. (8.11.2),

$$
\frac{d\nu_{o}(0^{+})}{dt} = \frac{\nu_{1} - \nu_{o}}{R_{2}C_{1}} = 0 \tag{8.11.12}
$$

We now impose Eq. (8.11.11) on the complete response in Eq. (8.11.10) at  $t = 0$ , for

$$
0 = 10 + A\qquad \Rightarrow \qquad A = -10 \tag{8.11.13}
$$

Taking the derivative of Eq. (8.11.10),

$$
\frac{d\nu_{o}}{d t} = e^{-t}(-A\cos 2t - B\sin 2t - 2A\sin 2t + 2B\cos 2t)
$$

Setting  $t = 0$  and incorporating Eq. (8.11.12), we obtain

$$
0 = -A + 2B \tag{8.11.14}
$$

From Eqs. (8.11.13) and (8.11.14),  $A = - 10$  and  $B = - 5$ . Thus, the step response becomes

$$
\nu_{o}(t) = 10 - e^{-t}(10\cos 2t + 5\sin 2t)\mathrm{mV},\qquad t > 0
$$

# 8.9 PSpice Analysis of RLC Circuits

RLC circuits can be analyzed with great ease using PSpice, just like the  $RC$  or  $RL$  circuits of Chapter 7. The following two examples will illustrate this. The reader may review Section D.4 in Appendix D on PSpice for transient analysis.

# Example 8.12

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-13/c95faf42-d8e0-4f06-a665-945fc5e108f1/0438fe6faefeb3b5d94c5cab4510ba7bbf38060d881f15fc611386179aee0ea1.jpg)  
Figure 8.35 For Example 8.12.

The input voltage in Fig. 8.35(a) is applied to the circuit in Fig. 8.35(b). Use PSpice to plot  $\nu (t)$  for  $0 < t < 4$  s.

# Solution:

1. Define. As true with most textbook problems, the problem is clearly defined.

2. Present. The input is equal to a single square wave of amplitude  $12 \mathrm{V}$  with a period of  $2 \mathrm{s}$ . We are asked to plot the output, using PSpice.

3. Alternative. Since we are required to use PSpice, that is the only alternative for a solution. However, we can check it using the technique illustrated in Section 8.5 (a step response for a series  $RLC$  circuit).

4. Attempt. The given circuit is drawn using Schematics as in Fig. 8.36. The pulse is specified using VPWL voltage source, but VPULSE could be used instead. Using the piecewise linear function, we set the attributes of VPWL as  $\mathrm{T1} = 0$ ,  $\mathrm{V1} = 0$ ,  $\mathrm{T2} = 0.001$ ,  $\mathrm{V2} = 12$ , and so forth, as shown in Fig. 8.36. Two voltage markers are inserted to plot the input and output voltages. Once the circuit is drawn and the attributes are set, we select

Analysis/Setup/Transient to open up the Transient Analysis dialog box. As a parallel  $RLC$  circuit, the roots of the characteristic equation are  $- 1$  and  $- 9$ . Thus, we may set Final Time as  $4 \mathrm{s}$  (four times the magnitude of the lower root). When the schematic

is saved, we select Analysis/Simulate and obtain the plots for the input and output voltages under the PSpice A/D window as shown in Fig. 8.37.

Figure 8.37 For Example 8.12: input and output.

Now we check using the technique from Section 8.5. We can start by realizing the Thevenin equivalent for the resistor- source combination is  $V_{\mathrm{Th}} = 12 / 2$  (the open circuit voltage divides equally across both resistors)  $= 6\mathrm{V}$ . The equivalent resistance is  $30\Omega$  (60 || 60). Thus, we can now solve for the response using  $R = 30\Omega$ ,  $L = 3\mathrm{H}$ , and  $C = (1 / 27)\mathrm{F}$ .

We first need to solve for  $\alpha$  and  $\omega_0$ :

$$
\alpha = R / (2L) = 30 / 6 = 5\qquad \mathrm{and}\qquad \omega_0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3\frac{1}{27}}} = 3
$$

Since 5 is greater than 3, we have the overdamped case

$$
s_{1,2} = -5\pm \sqrt{5^{2} - 9} = -1, -9,\qquad \nu (0) = 0, \[ \nu (\infty) = 6\mathrm{V},\qquad i(0) = 0 \]
$$

$$
i(t) = C\frac{d\nu(t)}{dt},
$$

where

$$
\begin{array}{l}\nu (t) = A_1e^{-t} + A_2e^{-9t} + 6 \\ \nu (0) = 0 = A_1 + A_2 + 6 \\ i(0) = 0 = C(-A_1 - 9A_2) \end{array}
$$

which yields  $A_1 = - 9A_2$ . Substituting this into the above, we get  $0 = 9A_2 - A_2 + 6$ , or  $A_2 = 0.75$  and  $A_1 = - 6.75$ .

$$
\nu (t) = (-6.75e^{-t} + 0.75e^{-9t} + 6)u(t)V\mathrm{for~all}0< t< 2\mathrm{s}.
$$

At  $t = 1\mathrm{s}$ ,  $\nu (1) = - 6.75e^{- 1} + 0.75e^{- 9} + 6 = - 2.483 + 0.0001 + 6 = 3.552\mathrm{V}$ . At  $t = 2\mathrm{s}$ ,  $\nu (2) = - 6.75e^{- 2} + 0 + 6 = 5.086\mathrm{V}$ .

Note that from  $2< t< 4\mathrm{s}$ ,  $V_{\mathrm{Th}} = 0$ , which implies that  $\nu (\infty) = 0$ . Therefore,  $\nu (t) = (A_3e^{- (t - 2)} + A_4e^{- 9(t - 2)})u(t - 2)\mathrm{V}$ . At  $t = 2\mathrm{s}$ ,  $A_3 + A_4 = 5.086$ .

$$
i(t) = \frac{(-A_3e^{-(t - 2)} - 9A_4e^{-9(t - 2)})}{27}
$$

and

$$
i(2) = \frac{(6.75e^{-2} - 6.75e^{-18})}{27} = 33.83 \mathrm{mA}
$$

Therefore,  $- A_{3} - 9A_{4} = 0.9135$

Combining the two equations, we get  $- A_{3} - 9(5.086 - A_{3}) = 0.9135$ , which leads to  $A_{3} = 5.835$  and  $A_{4} = - 0.749$

$$
\nu (t) = (5.835e^{-(t - 2)} - 0.749e^{-9(t - 2)})u(t - 2)\mathbf{V}
$$

At  $t = 3 \mathrm{s}$ ,  $\nu (3) = (2.147 - 0) = 2.147 \mathrm{V}$ . At  $t = 4 \mathrm{s}$ ,  $\nu (4) = 0.7897 \mathrm{V}$ .

5. Evaluate. A check between the values calculated above and the plot shown in Figure 8.37 shows good agreement within the obvious level of accuracy.

6. Satisfactory? Yes, we have agreement and the results can be presented as a solution to the problem.

$i(t)$  enters pin 1, the inductor is rotated three times before it is placed in the circuit. The same applies for the capacitor. We insert pseudo- components VIEWPOINT and IPROBE to determine the initial capacitor voltage and initial inductor current. We carry out a dc PSpice analysis by selecting Analysis/Simulate. As shown in Fig. 8.41(a), we obtain the initial capacitor voltage as  $0\mathrm{V}$  and the initial inductor current  $i(0)$  as  $4\mathrm{A}$  from the dc analysis. These initial values will be used in the transient analysis.

When the switch is moved to position  $b$ , the circuit becomes a source- free parallel  $RLC$  circuit with the schematic in Fig. 8.41(b).

Practice Problem 8.13

# 8.10 Duality

The concept of duality is a time- saving, effort- effective measure of solving circuit problems. Consider the similarity between Eqs. (8.4) and (8.29). The two equations are the same, except that we must interchange the following quantities: (1) voltage and current, (2) resistance and conductance, (3) capacitance and inductance. Thus, it sometimes occurs in circuit analysis that two different circuits have the same equations and solutions, except that the roles of certain complementary elements are interchanged. This interchangeability is known as the principle of duality.

The duality principle asserts a parallelism between pairs of characterizing equations and theorems of electric circuits.

# TABLE8.1

# Dual pairs.

<table><tr><td>Resistance R</td><td>Conductance G</td></tr><tr><td>Inductance L</td><td>Capacitance C</td></tr><tr><td>Voltage v</td><td>Current i</td></tr><tr><td>Voltage source</td><td>Current source</td></tr><tr><td>Node</td><td>Mesh</td></tr><tr><td>Series path</td><td>Parallel path</td></tr><tr><td>Open circuit</td><td>Short circuit</td></tr><tr><td>KVL</td><td>KCL</td></tr><tr><td>Thevenin</td><td>Norton</td></tr></table>

Even when the principle of linearity applies, a circuit element or variable may not have a dual. For example, mutual inductance (to be covered in Chapter 13) has no dual.

Dual pairs are shown in Table 8.1. Note that power does not appear in Table 8.1, because power has no dual. The reason for this is the principle of linearity; since power is not linear, duality does not apply. Also notice from Table 8.1 that the principle of duality extends to circuit elements, configurations, and theorems.

Two circuits that are described by equations of the same form, but in which the variables are interchanged, are said to be dual to each other.

Two circuits are said to be duals of one another if they are described by the same characterizing equations with dual quantities interchanged.

The usefulness of the duality principle is self- evident. Once we know the solution to one circuit, we automatically have the solution for the dual circuit. It is obvious that the circuits in Figs. 8.8 and 8.13 are dual. Consequently, the result in Eq. (8.32) is the dual of that in Eq. (8.11). We must keep in mind that the method described here for finding a dual is limited to planar circuits. Finding a dual for a nonplanar circuit is beyond the scope of this textbook because nonplanar circuits cannot be described by a system of mesh equations.

To find the dual of a given circuit, we do not need to write down the mesh or node equations. We can use a graphical technique. Given a planar circuit, we construct the dual circuit by taking the following three steps:

1. Place a node at the center of each mesh of the given circuit. Place the reference node (the ground) of the dual circuit outside the given circuit. 
2. Draw lines between the nodes such that each line crosses an element. Replace that element by its dual (see Table 8.1). 
3. To determine the polarity of voltage sources and direction of current sources, follow this rule: A voltage source that produces a positive (clockwise) mesh current has as its dual a current source whose reference direction is from the ground to the nonreference node.

In case of doubt, one may verify the dual circuit by writing the nodal or mesh equations. The mesh (or nodal) equations of the original circuit are similar to the nodal (or mesh) equations of the dual circuit. The duality principle is illustrated with the following two examples.

Construct the dual of the circuit in Fig. 8.44.

# Solution:

As shown in Fig. 8.45(a), we first locate nodes 1 and 2 in the two meshes and also the ground node 0 for the dual circuit. We draw a line between one node and another crossing an element. We replace the line joining the nodes by the duals of the elements which it crosses. For example, a line between nodes 1 and 2 crosses a 2- H inductor, and we place a 2- F capacitor (an inductor's dual) on the line. A line between nodes 1 and 0 crossing the 6- V voltage source will contain a 6- A current source. By drawing lines crossing all the elements, we construct the dual circuit on the given circuit as in Fig. 8.45(a). The dual circuit is redrawn in Fig. 8.45(b) for clarity.

To verify the polarity of the voltage source and the direction of the current source, we may apply mesh currents  $i_{1}, i_{2}$ , and  $i_{3}$  (all in the clockwise direction) in the original circuit in Fig. 8.48.

# 8.11 Applications

Practical applications of  $RLC$  circuits are found in control and communications circuits such as ringing circuits, peaking circuits, resonant circuits, smoothing circuits, and filters. Most of these circuits cannot be covered until we treat ac sources. For now, we will limit ourselves to two simple applications: automobile ignition and smoothing circuits.

# 8.11.1 Automobile Ignition System

In Section 7.9.4, we considered the automobile ignition system as a charging system. That was only a part of the system. Here, we consider another part- - the voltage generating system. The system is modeled by the circuit shown in Fig. 8.52. The 12- V source is due to the battery and alternator. The  $4 - \Omega$  resistor represents the resistance of the wiring. The ignition coil is modeled by the  $8\mathrm{- mH}$  inductor. The  $1 - \mu \mathrm{F}$  capacitor (known as the condenser to automechanics) is in parallel with the switch (known as the breaking points or electronic ignition). In the following example, we determine how the  $RLC$  circuit in Fig. 8.52 is used in generating high voltage.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-13/c95faf42-d8e0-4f06-a665-945fc5e108f1/1ff61440e6358cf509c7b7c40ff95c30365631c677948195759d9dda17c96e18.jpg)  
Figure 8.52 Automobile ignition circuit.

Assuming that the switch in Fig. 8.52 is closed prior to  $t = 0^{- }$ , find the inductor voltage  $\nu_{L}$  for  $t > 0$ .

# Solution:

If the switch is closed prior to  $t = 0^{- }$  and the circuit is in steady state, then

$$
i(0^{-}) = \frac{12}{4} = 3\mathrm{A},\qquad \nu_{C}(0^{-}) = 0
$$

At  $t = 0^{+}$ , the switch is opened. The continuity conditions require that

$$
i(0^{+}) = 3\mathrm{A},\qquad \nu_{C}(0^{+}) = 0 \tag{8.16.1}
$$

We obtain  $di(0^{+}) / dt$  from  $\nu_{L}(0^{+})$ . Applying KVL to the mesh at  $t = 0^{+}$  yields

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{-12+4i(0^{+})+\nu_{L}(0^{+})+\nu_{C}(0^{+})=0}}\\ {{-12+4\times3+\nu_{L}(0^{+})+0=0\qquad\Rightarrow\qquad\nu_{L}(0^{+})=0}}\end{array}
$$

Hence,

$$
\frac{d i(0^{+})}{d t} = \frac{\nu_{L}(0^{+})}{L} = 0 \tag{8.16.2}
$$

As  $t \to \infty$ , the system reaches steady state, so that the capacitor acts like an open circuit. Then

$$
i(\infty) = 0 \tag{8.16.3}
$$

If we apply KVL to the mesh for  $t > 0$ , we obtain

$$
12 = R i + L \frac{d i}{d t} + \frac{1}{C} \int_{0}^{1} i d t + \nu_{C}(0)
$$

Taking the derivative of each term yields

$$
\frac{d^{2} i}{d t^{2}} + \frac{R}{L} \frac{d i}{d t} + \frac{i}{L C} = 0 \tag{8.16.4}
$$

We obtain the form of the transient response by following the procedure in Section 8.3. Substituting  $R = 4 \Omega$ ,  $L = 8 \mathrm{mH}$ , and  $C = 1 \mu \mathrm{F}$ , we get

$$
\alpha = \frac{R}{2 L} = 250, \qquad \omega_{0} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{L C}} = 1.118 \times 10^{4}
$$

Since  $\alpha < \omega_{0}$ , the response is underdamped. The damped natural frequency is

$$
\omega_{d} = \sqrt{\omega_{0}^{2} - \alpha^{2}} \simeq \omega_{0} = 1.118 \times 10^{4}
$$

The form of the transient response is

$$
i_{t}(t) = e^{-\alpha} (A \cos \omega_{d} t + B \sin \omega_{d} t) \tag{8.16.5}
$$

where  $A$  and  $B$  are constants. The steady- state response is

$$
i_{s s}(t) = i(\infty) = 0 \tag{8.16.6}
$$

so that the complete response is

$$
i(t) = i_{t}(t) + i_{s s}(t) = e^{-250t} (A \cos 11, 180 t + B \sin 11, 180 t) \tag{8.16.7}
$$

We now determine  $A$  and  $B$

$$
i(t) = 3 = A + 0 \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad A = 3
$$

Taking the derivative of Eq. (8.16.7),

$$
\begin{array}{r l} & {\frac{d i}{d t} = -250e^{-250t}(A\cos 11,180t + B\sin 11,180t)}\\ & {\qquad +e^{-250t}(-11,180A\sin 11,180t + 11,180B\cos 11,180t)} \end{array}
$$

Setting  $t = 0$  and incorporating Eq. (8.16.2),

$$
0 = -250A + 11,180B \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad B = 0.0671
$$

Thus,

$$
i(t) = e^{-250t} (3 \cos 11, 180 t + 0.0671 \sin 11, 180 t) \tag{8.16.8}
$$

The voltage across the inductor is then

$$
\nu_{L}(t) = L \frac{d i}{d t} = -268 e^{-250 t} \sin 11, 180 t \tag{8.16.9}
$$

This has a maximum value when sine is unity, that is, at  $11,180t_{0} = \pi /2$  or  $t_{0} = 140.5~\mu \mathrm{s}$  .At time  $= t_{0}$  , the inductor voltage reaches its peak, which is

$$
\nu_{L}(t_{0}) = -268e^{-250t_{0}} = -259\mathrm{~V} \tag{8.16.10}
$$

Although this is far less than the voltage range of 6000 to  $10,000\mathrm{~V~}$  required to fire the spark plug in a typical automobile, a device known as a transformer (to be discussed in Chapter 13) is used to step up the inductor voltage to the required level.

In Fig. 8.52, find the capacitor voltage  $\nu_{C}$  for  $t > 0$

Answer:  $12 - 12e^{- 250t}\cos 11,180t + 267.7e^{- 250t}\sin 11,180t\mathrm{~V}.$

# 8.11.2 Smoothing Circuits

In a typical digital communication system, the signal to be transmitted is first sampled. Sampling refers to the procedure of selecting samples of a signal for processing, as opposed to processing the entire signal. Each sample is converted into a binary number represented by a series of pulses. The pulses are transmitted by a transmission line such as a coaxial cable, twisted pair, or optical fiber. At the receiving end, the signal is applied to a digital- to- analog (D/A) converter whose output is a "staircase" function, that is, constant at each time interval. In order to recover the transmitted analog signal, the output is smoothed by letting it pass through a "smoothing" circuit, as illustrated in Fig. 8.53. An RLC circuit may be used as the smoothing circuit.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-13/c95faf42-d8e0-4f06-a665-945fc5e108f1/e0eede0023cad711fe91e05161ffa69924813b746ea3616e1d52e6194ccb4c22.jpg)

To be able to plot both input and output voltages, we insert two voltage markers as shown. We select Analysis/Setup/Transient to open up the Transient Analysis dialog box and set Final Time as  $6\mathrm{~s~}$  Once the schematic is saved, we select Analysis/Simulate to run and obtain the plots shown in Fig. 8.55(b).

# 8.12 Summary

1. The determination of the initial values  $x(0)$  and  $\frac{dx(0)}{dt}$  and final value  $x(\infty)$  is crucial to analyzing second-order circuits.

2. The  $RLC$  circuit is second-order because it is described by a second-order differential equation. Its characteristic equation is

$s^{2} + 2\alpha s + \omega_{0}^{2} = 0$ , where  $\alpha$  is the neper frequency and  $\omega_{0}$  is the undamped natural frequency. For a series circuit,  $\alpha = R / 2L$ , for a parallel circuit  $\alpha = 1 / 2RC$ , and for both cases  $\omega_{0} = 1 / \sqrt{LC}$ .

3. If there are no independent sources in the circuit after switching (or sudden change), we regard the circuit as source-free. The complete solution is the natural response.

4. The natural response of an  $RLC$  circuit is overdamped, under-damped, or critically damped, depending on the roots of the characteristic equation. The response is critically damped when the roots are equal ( $s_{1} = s_{2}$  or  $\alpha = \omega_{0}$ ), overdamped when the roots are real and unequal ( $s_{1} = s_{2}$  or  $\alpha > \omega_{0}$ ), or under-damped when the roots are complex conjugate ( $s_{1} = s_{2}^{*}$  or  $\alpha < \omega_{0}$ ).

5. If independent sources are present in the circuit after switching, the complete response is the sum of the transient response and the steady-state response.

6. PSpice is used to analyze  $RLC$  circuits in the same way as for  $RC$  or  $RL$  circuits.

7. Two circuits are dual if the mesh equations that describe one circuit have the same form as the nodal equations that describe the other. The analysis of one circuit gives the analysis of its dual circuit.

8. The automobile ignition circuit and the smoothing circuit are typical applications of the material covered in this chapter.

# Section 8.3 Source-Free Series RLC Circuit

8.7 A series RLC circuit has  $R = 20\mathrm{k}\Omega$ $L = 0.2\mathrm{mH}$  and  $C = 5\mu \mathrm{F}$  What type of damping is exhibited by the circuit?

8.8 Design a problem to help other students better understand source- free RLC circuits.

8.9 The current in an RLC circuit is described by

$$
\frac{d^{2}i}{d t^{2}} +10\frac{d i}{d t} +25i = 0
$$

If  $i(0) = 10\mathrm{A}$  and  $d i(0) / d t = 0$  , find  $i(t)$  for  $t > 0$

8.10 The differential equation that describes the voltage in an RLC network is

$$
\frac{d^{2}\nu}{d t^{2}} +5\frac{d\nu}{d t} +4\nu = 0
$$

Given that  $\nu (0) = 0$ $d\nu (0) / d t = 10\mathrm{V / s}$  ,obtain  $\nu (t)$

8.11 The natural response of an RLC circuit is described by the differential equation

$$
\frac{d^{2}\nu}{d t^{2}} +2\frac{d\nu}{d t} +\nu = 0
$$

for which the initial conditions are  $\nu (0) = 10\mathrm{V}$  and  $d\nu (0) / d t = 0$  . Solve for  $\nu (t)$

8.12 If  $R = 50\Omega$ $L = 1.5\mathrm{H}$  what value of  $C$  will make an RLC series circuit:

(a) overdamped, 
(b) critically damped,

# Section 8.5 Step Response of a Series RLC Circuit

8.26 The step response of an RLC circuit is given by

$$

$$

Given that  $i(0) = 2$  and  $d i(0) / d t = 4$  , solve for  $i(t)$

8.27 A branch voltage in an RLC circuit is described by

$$
\frac{d^{2}\nu}{d t^{2}} +4\frac{d\nu}{d t} +8\nu = 24
$$

If the initial conditions are  $\nu (0) = 0 = d\nu (0) / d t$  , find  $\nu (t)$

8.28 A series RLC circuit is described by

$$
L\frac{d^{2}i}{d t^{2}} +R\frac{d i}{d t} +\frac{i}{C} = 10
$$

Find the response when  $L = 0.5\mathrm{H},R = 4\Omega$  and  $C = 0.2\mathrm{F}.$  Let  $i(0) = 1$ $d i(0) / d t = 0$

8.29 Solve the following differential equations subject to the specified initial conditions

(a)  $d^{2}\nu /d t^{2} + 4\nu = 12$ $\nu (0) = 0$ $d\nu (0) / d t = 2$

(b)  $d^{2}i / d t^{2} + 5d i / d t + 4i = 8$ $i(0) = -1$

$$
d i(0) / d t = 0
$$

(c)  $d^{2}\nu /d t^{2} + 2d\nu /d t + \nu = 3$ $\nu (0) = 5$

$$
d\nu (0) / d t = 1
$$

(d)  $d^{2}i / d t^{2} + 2d i / d t + 5i = 10$ $i(0) = 4$

$$
d i(0) / d t = -2
$$

8.30 The step responses of a series RLC circuit are

$$
\nu_{C} = 40 - 10e^{-2000t} - 10e^{-4000t}\mathrm{V},\qquad t > 0
$$

$$
i_{L}(t) = 3e^{-2000t} + 6e^{-4000t}\mathrm{mA},\qquad t > 0

# Enhancing Your Skills and Your Career

# ABET EC 2000 criteria (3.d), "an ability to function on multi-disciplinary teams."

The "ability to function on multidisciplinary teams" is inherently critical for the working engineer. Engineers rarely, if ever, work by themselves. Engineers will always be part of some team. One of the things I like to remind students is that you do not have to like everyone on a team; you just have to be a successful part of that team.

Most frequently, these teams include individuals from a variety of engineering disciplines, as well as individuals from nonengineering disciplines such as marketing and finance.

Students can easily develop and enhance this skill by working in study groups in every course they take. Clearly, working in study groups in nonengineering courses, as well as engineering courses outside your discipline, will also give you experience with multidisciplinary teams.

Nikola Tesla (1856- 1943) and George Westinghouse (1846- 1914) helped establish alternating current as the primary mode of electricity transmission and distribution.

Today it is obvious that ac generation is well established as the form of electric power that makes widespread distribution of electric power efficient and economical. However, at the end of the 19th century, which was the better- ac or dc- was hotly debated and had extremely outspoken supporters on both sides. The dc side was led by Thomas Edison, who had earned a lot of respect for his many contributions. Power generation using ac really began to build after the successful contributions of Tesla. The real commercial success in ac came from George Westinghouse and the outstanding team, including Tesla, he assembled. In addition, two other big names were C. F. Scott and B. G. Lamme.

The most significant contribution to the early success of ac was the patenting of the polyphase ac motor by Tesla in 1888. The induction motor and polyphase generation and distribution systems doomed the use of dc as the prime energy source.

# 9.1 Introduction

Thus far our analysis has been limited for the most part to dc circuits: those circuits excited by constant or time- invariant sources. We have restricted the forcing function to dc sources for the sake of simplicity, for pedagogic reasons, and also for historic reasons. Historically, dc sources were the main means of providing electric power up until the late 1800s. At the end of that century, the battle of direct current versus alternating current began. Both had their advocates among the electrical engineers of the time. Because ac is more efficient and economical to transmit over long distances, ac systems ended up the winner. Thus, it is in keeping with the historical sequence of events that we considered dc sources first.

We now begin the analysis of circuits in which the source voltage or current is time- varying. In this chapter, we are particularly interested in sinusoidally time- varying excitation, or simply, excitation by a sinusoid.

A sinusoid is a signal that has the form of the sine or cosine function.

A sinusoidal current is usually referred to as alternating current (ac). Such a current reverses at regular time intervals and has alternately positive and negative values. Circuits driven by sinusoidal current or voltage sources are called ac circuits.

We are interested in sinusoids for a number of reasons. First, nature itself is characteristically sinusoidal. We experience sinusoidal variation in the motion of a pendulum, the vibration of a string, the ripples on the ocean surface, and the natural response of underdamped second- order systems, to mention but a few. Second, a sinusoidal signal is easy to generate and transmit. It is the form of voltage generated throughout the world and supplied to homes, factories, laboratories, and so on. It is the dominant form of signal in the communications and electric power industries. Third, through Fourier analysis, any practical periodic signal can be represented by a sum of sinusoids. Sinusoids, therefore, play an important role in the analysis of periodic signals. Lastly, a sinusoid is easy to handle mathematically. The derivative and integral of a sinusoid are themselves sinusoids. For these and other reasons, the sinusoid is an extremely important function in circuit analysis.

A sinusoidal forcing function produces both a transient response and a steady- state response, much like the step function, which we studied in Chapters 7 and 8. The transient response dies out with time so that only the steady- state response remains. When the transient response has become negligibly small compared with the steady- state response, we say that the circuit is operating at sinusoidal steady state. It is this sinusoidal steady- state response that is of main interest to us in this chapter.

We begin with a basic discussion of sinusoids and phasors. We then introduce the concepts of impedance and admittance. The basic circuit laws, Kirchhoff's and Ohm's, introduced for dc circuits, will be applied to ac circuits. Finally, we consider applications of ac circuits in phase- shifters and bridges.

# 9.2 Sinusoids

Consider the sinusoidal voltage

$$
\nu (t) = V_{m}\sin \omega t \tag{9.1}
$$

where

$V_{m} =$  the amplitude of the sinusoid  $\omega =$  the angular frequency in radians/s  $\omega t =$  the argument of the sinusoid

The sinusoid is shown in Fig. 9.1(a) as a function of its argument and in Fig. 9.1(b) as a function of time. It is evident that the sinusoid repeats itself every  $T$  seconds; thus,  $T$  is called the period of the sinusoid. From the two plots in Fig. 9.1, we observe that  $\omega T = 2\pi$ ,

$$
T = \frac{2\pi}{\omega} \tag{9.2}
$$

Heinrich Rudorf Hertz (1857- 1894), a German experimental physicist, demonstrated that electromagnetic waves obey the same fundamental laws as light. His work confirmed James Clerk Maxwell's celebrated 1864 theory and prediction that such waves existed.

Hertz was born into a prosperous family in Hamburg, Germany. He attended the University of Berlin and did his doctorate under the prominent physicist Hermann von Helmholtz. He became a professor at Karlsruhe, where he began his quest for electromagnetic waves. Hertz successfully generated and detected electromagnetic waves; he was the first to show that light is electromagnetic energy. In 1887, Hertz noted for the first time the photoelectric effect of electrons in a molecular structure. Although Hertz only lived to the age of 37, his discovery of electromagnetic waves paved the way for the practical use of such waves in radio, television, and other communication systems. The unit of frequency, the hertz, bears his name.

Figure 9.1 A sketch of  $V_{m}$  sin  $\omega t$ : (a) as a function of  $\omega t$ , (b) as a function of  $t$ .

The fact that  $\nu (t)$  repeats itself every  $T$  seconds is shown by replacing  $t$  by  $t + T$  in Eq. (9.1). We get

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{\nu(t+T)=V_{m}\sin\omega(t+T)=V_{m}\sin\omega\Big(t+\frac{2\pi}{\omega}\Big)}}\\ {{=V_{m}\sin(\omega t+2\pi)=V_{m}\sin\omega t=\nu(t)}}\end{array} \tag{9.3}
$$

Hence,

$$
\nu (t + T) = \nu (t) \tag{9.4}
$$

that is,  $\nu$  has the same value at  $t + T$  as it does at  $t$  and  $\nu (t)$  is said to be periodic. In general,

A periodic function is one that satisfies  $f(t) = f(t + nT)$ , for all  $t$  and for all integers  $n$ .

As mentioned, the period  $T$  of the periodic function is the time of one complete cycle or the number of seconds per cycle. The reciprocal of this quantity is the number of cycles per second, known as the cyclic frequency  $f$  of the sinusoid. Thus,

$$
f = \frac{1}{T} \tag{9.5}
$$

From Eqs. (9.2) and (9.5), it is clear that

$$
\omega = 2\pi f \tag{9.6}
$$

While  $\omega$  is in radians per second (rad/s),  $f$  is in hertz (Hz).

Let us now consider a more general expression for the sinusoid,

$$
\nu (t) = V_{m}\sin (\omega t + \phi) \tag{9.7}
$$

where  $(\omega t + \phi)$  is the argument and  $\phi$  is the phase. Both argument and phase can be in radians or degrees.

Let us examine the two sinusoids

$$
\nu_{1}(t) = V_{m}\sin \omega t\qquad \mathrm{and}\qquad \nu_{2}(t) = V_{m}\sin (\omega t + \phi) \tag{9.8}
$$

shown in Fig. 9.2. The starting point of  $\nu_{2}$  in Fig. 9.2 occurs first in time. Therefore, we say that  $\nu_{2}$  leads  $\nu_{1}$  by  $\phi$  or that  $\nu_{1}$  lags  $\nu_{2}$  by  $\phi$ . If  $\phi \neq 0$ , we also say that  $\nu_{1}$  and  $\nu_{2}$  are out of phase. If  $\phi = 0$ , then  $\nu_{1}$  and  $\nu_{2}$  are said to be in phase; they reach their minima and maxima at exactly the same time. We can compare  $\nu_{1}$  and  $\nu_{2}$  in this manner because they operate at the same frequency; they do not need to have the same amplitude.

Figure 9.2 Two sinusoids with different phases.

A sinusoid can be expressed in either sine or cosine form. When comparing two sinusoids, it is expedient to express both as either sine or cosine with positive amplitudes. This is achieved by using the following trigonometric identities:

$$
\begin{array}{r}\sin (A\pm B) = \sin A\cos B\pm \cos A\sin B\\ \cos (A\pm B) = \cos A\cos B\mp \sin A\sin B \end{array} \tag{9.9}
$$

With these identities, it is easy to show that

$$
\begin{array}{r}\sin (\omega t\pm 180^{\circ}) = -\sin \omega t\\ \cos (\omega t\pm 180^{\circ}) = -\cos \omega t\\ \sin (\omega t\pm 90^{\circ}) = \pm \cos \omega t\\ \cos (\omega t\pm 90^{\circ}) = \mp \sin \omega t \end{array} \tag{9.10}
$$

Using these relationships, we can transform a sinusoid from sine form to cosine form or vice versa.

Figure 9.3 A graphical means of relating cosine and sine: (a)  $\cos (\omega t - 90^{\circ}) = \sin \omega t$ , (b)  $\sin (\omega t + 180^{\circ}) = -\sin \omega t$ .

A graphical approach may be used to relate or compare sinusoids as an alternative to using the trigonometric identities in Eqs. (9.9) and (9.10). Consider the set of axes shown in Fig. 9.3(a). The horizontal axis represents the magnitude of cosine, while the vertical axis (pointing down) denotes the magnitude of sine. Angles are measured positively counterclockwise from the horizontal, as usual in polar coordinates. This graphical technique can be used to relate two sinusoids. For example, we see in Fig. 9.3(a) that subtracting  $90^{\circ}$  from the argument of  $\cos \omega t$  gives  $\sin \omega t$ , or  $\cos (\omega t - 90^{\circ}) = \sin \omega t$ . Similarly, adding  $180^{\circ}$  to the argument of  $\sin \omega t$  gives  $- \sin \omega t$ , or  $\sin (\omega t + 180^{\circ}) = - \sin \omega t$ , as shown in Fig. 9.3(b).

The graphical technique can also be used to add two sinusoids of the same frequency when one is in sine form and the other is in cosine form. To add  $A$  cos  $\omega t$  and  $B$  sin  $\omega t$ , we note that  $A$  is the magnitude of  $\cos \omega t$  while  $B$  is the magnitude of  $\sin \omega t$ , as shown in Fig. 9.4(a). The magnitude and argument of the resultant sinusoid in cosine form is readily obtained from the triangle. Thus,

$$
A \cos \omega t + B \sin \omega t = C \cos (\omega t - \theta) \tag{9.11}
$$

where

$$
C = \sqrt{A^{2} + B^{2}}, \qquad \theta = \tan^{-1} \frac{B}{A} \tag{9.12}
$$

For example, we may add  $3 \cos \omega t$  and  $- 4 \sin \omega t$  as shown in Fig. 9.4(b) and obtain

$$
3 \cos \omega t - 4 \sin \omega t = 5 \cos (\omega t + 53.1^{\circ}) \tag{9.13}
$$

Compared with the trigonometric identities in Eqs. (9.9) and (9.10), the graphical approach eliminates memorization. However, we must not confuse the sine and cosine axes with the axes for complex numbers to be discussed in the next section. Something else to note in Figs. 9.3 and 9.4 is that although the natural tendency is to have the vertical axis point up, the positive direction of the sine function is down in the present case.

Find the amplitude, phase, period, and frequency of the sinusoid

$$
\nu (t) = 12\cos (50t + 10^{\circ})\mathrm{V}.
$$

# Solution:

The amplitude is  $V_{m} = 12 \mathrm{V}$ .

The phase is  $\phi = 10^{\circ}$ .

The angular frequency is  $\omega = 50 \mathrm{rad / s}$ .

The period  $T = \frac{2\pi}{\omega} = \frac{2\pi}{50} = 0.1257 \mathrm{s}$ .

The frequency is  $f = \frac{1}{T} = 7.958 \mathrm{Hz}$ .

Given the sinusoid  $30 \sin (4\pi t - 45^{\circ})$ , calculate its amplitude, phase, angular frequency, period, and frequency.

Answer: 30,  $- 75^{\circ}$ , 12.57 rad/s, 500 ms, 2 Hz.

Calculate the phase angle between  $\nu_{1} = - 10 \cos (\omega t + 50^{\circ})$  and  $\nu_{2} = 12 \sin (\omega t - 10^{\circ})$ . State which sinusoid is leading.

# Solution:

Let us calculate the phase in three ways. The first two methods use trigonometric identities, while the third method uses the graphical approach.

METHOD 1 In order to compare  $\nu_{1}$  and  $\nu_{2}$ , we must express them in the same form. If we express them in cosine form with positive amplitudes,

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{\nu_{1}=-10\cos(\omega t+50^{\circ})=10\cos(\omega t+50^{\circ}-180^{\circ})}}\\ {{\nu_{1}=10\cos(\omega t-130^{\circ})\qquad\mathrm{or}\qquad\nu_{1}=10\cos(\omega t+230^{\circ})}}\end{array} \tag{9.2.1}
$$

and

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{\nu_{2}=12\sin(\omega t-10^{\circ})=12\cos(\omega t-10^{\circ}-90^{\circ})}}\\ {{\nu_{2}=12\cos(\omega t-100^{\circ})}}\end{array} \tag{9.2.2}
$$

It can be deduced from Eqs. (9.2.1) and (9.2.2) that the phase difference between  $\nu_{1}$  and  $\nu_{2}$  is  $30^{\circ}$ . We can write  $\nu_{2}$  as

$$
\nu_{2} = 12\cos (\omega t - 130^{\circ} + 30^{\circ})\quad \mathrm{or}\quad \nu_{2} = 12\cos (\omega t + 260^{\circ}) \tag{9.2.3}
$$

Comparing Eqs. (9.2.1) and (9.2.3) shows clearly that  $\nu_{2}$  leads  $\nu_{1}$  by  $30^{\circ}$ .

METHOD 2 Alternatively, we may express  $\nu_{1}$  in sine form:

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{\nu_{1}=-10\cos(\omega t+50^{\circ})=10\sin(\omega t+50^{\circ}-90^{\circ})}}\\ {{=10\sin(\omega t-40^{\circ})=10\sin(\omega t-10^{\circ}-30^{\circ})}}\end{array}
$$

Figure 9.5 For Example 9.2.

But  $\nu_{2} = 12\sin (\omega t - 10^{\circ})$  . Comparing the two shows that  $\nu_{1}$  lags  $\nu_{2}$  by  $30^{\circ}$  . This is the same as saying that  $\nu_{2}$  leads  $\nu_{1}$  by  $30^{\circ}$

■ METHOD 3 We may regard  $\nu_{1}$  as simply  $- 10 \cos \omega t$  with a phase shift of  $+50^{\circ}$ . Hence,  $\nu_{1}$  is as shown in Fig. 9.5. Similarly,  $\nu_{2}$  is  $12 \sin \omega t$  with a phase shift of  $- 10^{\circ}$ , as shown in Fig. 9.5. It is easy to see from Fig. 9.5 that  $\nu_{2}$  leads  $\nu_{1}$  by  $30^{\circ}$ , that is,  $90^{\circ} - 50^{\circ} - 10^{\circ}$ .

# Practice Problem 9.2

Find the phase angle between

$$
i_{1} = -4\sin (377t + 55^{\circ}) \qquad \text{and} \qquad i_{2} = 5\cos (377t - 65^{\circ})
$$

Does  $i_{1}$  lead or lag  $i_{2}$ ?

Answer:  $210^{\circ}$ ,  $i_{1}$  leads  $i_{2}$ .

# 9.3 Phasors

Sinusoids are easily expressed in terms of phasors, which are more convenient to work with than sine and cosine functions.

A phasor is a complex number that represents the amplitude and phase of a sinusoid.

Charles Proteus Steinmetz (1865- 1923) was a German- Austrian mathematician and electrical engineer.

Appendix B presents a short tutorial on complex numbers.

Phasors provide a simple means of analyzing linear circuits excited by sinusoidal sources; solutions of such circuits would be intractable otherwise. The notion of solving ac circuits using phasors was first introduced by Charles Steinmetz in 1893. Before we completely define phasors and apply them to circuit analysis, we need to be thoroughly familiar with complex numbers.

A complex number  $z$  can be written in rectangular form as

$$
z = x + j y \tag{9.14a}
$$

where  $j = \sqrt{- 1}$ ,  $x$  is the real part of  $z$ ;  $y$  is the imaginary part of  $z$ . In this context, the variables  $x$  and  $y$  do not represent a location as in two- dimensional vector analysis but rather the real and imaginary parts of  $z$  in the complex plane. Nevertheless, we note that there are some resemblances between manipulating complex numbers and manipulating two- dimensional vectors.

The complex number  $z$  can also be written in polar or exponential form as

$$
z = r / \phi = r e^{j\phi} \tag{9.14b}
$$

# Historical

Charles Proteus Steinmetz (1865- 1923), a German- Austrian mathematician and engineer, introduced the phasor method (covered in this chapter) in ac circuit analysis. He is also noted for his work on the theory of hysteresis.

Steinmetz was born in Breslau, Germany, and lost his mother at the age of one. As a youth, he was forced to leave Germany because of his political activities just as he was about to complete his doctoral dissertation in mathematics at the University of Breslau. He migrated to Switzerland and later to the United States, where he was employed by General Electric in 1893. That same year, he published a paper in which complex numbers were used to analyze ac circuits for the first time. This led to one of his many textbooks, Theory and Calculation of ac Phenomena, published by McGraw- Hill in 1897. In 1901, he became the president of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, which later became the IEEE.

where  $r$  is the magnitude of  $z$ , and  $\phi$  is the phase of  $z$ . We notice that  $z$  can be represented in three ways:

$$
\begin{array}{l l}{{z=x+j y}}&{{\mathrm{Rectangular~form}}}\\ {{z=r\underline{{\phi}}}}&{{\mathrm{Polar~form}}}\\ {{z=r e^{j\phi}}}&{{\mathrm{Exponential~form}}}\end{array} \tag{9.15}
$$

The relationship between the rectangular form and the polar form is shown in Fig. 9.6, where the  $x$  axis represents the real part and the  $y$  axis represents the imaginary part of a complex number. Given  $x$  and  $y$ , we can get  $r$  and  $\phi$  as

$$
r = \sqrt{x^{2} + y^{2}},\qquad \phi = \tan^{-1}{\frac{y}{x}} \tag{9.16a}
$$

On the other hand, if we know  $r$  and  $\phi$ , we can obtain  $x$  and  $y$  as

$$
x = r\cos \phi ,\qquad y = r\sin \phi \tag{9.16b}
$$

Thus,  $z$  may be written as

$$
z = x + j y = r / \underline{{\phi}} = r(\cos \phi +j\sin \phi) \tag{9.17}
$$

Addition and subtraction of complex numbers are better performed in rectangular form; multiplication and division are better done in polar form. Given the complex numbers

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-13/c95faf42-d8e0-4f06-a665-945fc5e108f1/e732ac200093bbd57c5be21c6a7b3548fef4818b25e76245ed141aac2331d637.jpg)

$$

the following operations are important. Addition:

$$
z_{1} + z_{2} = (x_{1} + x_{2}) + j(y_{1} + y_{2}) \tag{9.18a}
$$

# Subtraction:

$$
z_{1} - z_{2} = (x_{1} - x_{2}) + j(y_{1} - y_{2}) \tag{9.18b}
$$

Multiplication:

$$
z_{1}z_{2} = r_{1}r_{2} / \phi_{1} + \phi_{2} \tag{9.18c}
$$

Division:

$$
\frac{z_{1}}{z_{2}} = \frac{r_{1}}{r_{2}} / \phi_{1} - \phi_{2} \tag{9.18d}
$$

Reciprocal:

$$
\frac{1}{z} = \frac{1}{r} / - \phi \tag{9.18e}
$$

Square Root:

$$
\sqrt{z} = \sqrt{r} /\phi /2 \tag{9.18f}
$$

Complex Conjugate:

$$
z^{*} = x - j y = r / - \phi = r e^{-j\phi} \tag{9.18g}
$$

Note that from Eq. (9.18e),

$$
\frac{1}{j} = -j \tag{9.18h}
$$

These are the basic properties of complex numbers we need. Other properties of complex numbers can be found in Appendix B.

The idea of phasor representation is based on Euler's identity. In general,

$$
e^{\pm j\phi} = \cos \phi \pm j\sin \phi \tag{9.19}
$$

which shows that we may regard  $\cos \phi$  and  $\sin \phi$  as the real and imaginary parts of  $e^{j\phi}$ ; we may write

$$
\begin{array}{r}\cos \phi = \operatorname {Re}(e^{j\phi}) \\ \sin \phi = \operatorname {Im}(e^{j\phi}) \end{array} \tag{9.20b}
$$

where  $\operatorname{Re}$  and  $\operatorname{Im}$  stand for the real part of and the imaginary part of. Given a sinusoid  $\nu (t) = V_{m}\cos (\omega t + \phi)$ , we use Eq. (9.20a) to express  $\nu (t)$  as

$$
\nu (t) = V_{m}\cos (\omega t + \phi) = \operatorname {Re}(V_{m}e^{j(\omega t + \phi)}) \tag{9.21}
$$

or

$$
\nu (t) = \operatorname {Re}(V_{m}e^{j\phi}e^{j\omega t}) \tag{9.22}
$$

Thus,

$$
\nu (t) = \operatorname {Re}(\mathbf{V}e^{j\omega t}) \tag{9.23}
$$

where

$$
\mathbf{V} = V_{m}e^{j\phi} = V_{m} / \phi \tag{9.24}
$$

$\mathbf{V}$  is thus the phasor representation of the sinusoid  $\nu (t)$ , as we said earlier. In other words, a phasor is a complex representation of the magnitude and phase of a sinusoid. Either Eq. (9.20a) or Eq. (9.20b) can be used to develop the phasor, but the standard convention is to use Eq. (9.20a).

One way of looking at Eqs. (9.23) and (9.24) is to consider the plot of the sinor  $\mathbf{V}e^{j\omega t} = V_{m}e^{j(\omega t + \phi)}$  on the complex plane. As time increases, the sinor rotates on a circle of radius  $V_{m}$  at an angular velocity  $\omega$  in the counterclockwise direction, as shown in Fig. 9.7(a). We may regard  $\nu (t)$  as the projection of the sinor  $\mathbf{V}e^{j\omega t}$  on the real axis, as shown in Fig. 9.7(b). The value of the sinor at time  $t = 0$  is the phasor  $\mathbf{V}$  of the sinusoid  $\nu (t)$ . The sinor may be regarded as a rotating phasor. Thus, whenever a sinusoid is expressed as a phasor, the term  $e^{j\omega t}$  is implicitly present. It is therefore important, when dealing with phasors, to keep in mind the frequency  $\omega$  of the phasor; otherwise we can make serious mistakes.

A phasor may be regarded as a mathematical equivalent of a sinusoid with the time dependence dropped.

If we use sine for the phasor instead of cosine, then  $\nu (t) = V_{m}\sin (\omega t + \phi) = \operatorname {Im}(V_{m}e^{j(\omega t + \phi)})$  and the corresponding phasor is the same as that in Eq. (9.24).

Figure 9.7 Representation of  $\mathbf{V}e^{j\omega t}$ : (a) sinor rotating counterclockwise, (b) its projection on the real axis, as a function of time.

Equation (9.23) states that to obtain the sinusoid corresponding to a given phasor  $\mathbf{V}$ , multiply the phasor by the time factor  $e^{j\omega t}$  and take the real part. As a complex quantity, a phasor may be expressed in rectangular form, polar form, or exponential form. Because a phasor has magnitude and phase ("direction"), it behaves as a vector and is printed in boldface. For example, phasors  $\mathbf{V} = V_{m} / \phi$  and  $\mathbf{I} = I_{m} / - \theta$  are graphically represented in Fig. 9.8. Such a graphical representation of phasors is known as a phasor diagram.

Equations (9.21) through (9.23) reveal that to get the phasor corresponding to a sinusoid, we first express the sinusoid in the cosine form so that the sinusoid can be written as the real part of a complex number. Then we take out the time factor  $e^{j\omega t}$ , and whatever is left is the phasor corresponding to the sinusoid. By suppressing the time factor, we transform the sinusoid from the time domain to the phasor domain. This transformation is summarized as follows:

We use lightface italic letters such as  $z$  to represent complex numbers but boldface letters such as  $\mathbf{V}$  to represent phasors, because phasors are vectorlike quantities.

Figure 9.8 A phasor diagram showing  $\mathbf{V} = V_{m} / \phi$  and  $\mathbf{I} = I_{m} / - \theta$ .

Given a sinusoid  $\nu (t) = V_{m}\cos (\omega t + \phi)$ , we obtain the corresponding phasor as  $\mathbf{V} = V_{m} / \phi$ . Equation (9.25) is also demonstrated in Table 9.1, where the sine function is considered in addition to the cosine function. From Eq. (9.25), we see that to get the phasor representation of a sinusoid, we express it in cosine form and take the magnitude and phase. Given a phasor, we obtain the time domain representation as the cosine function with the same magnitude as the phasor and the argument as  $\omega t$  plus the phase of the phasor. The idea of expressing information in alternate domains is fundamental to all areas of engineering.

# TABLE 9.1

# Sinusoid-phasor transformation.

<table><tr><td>Time domain representation</td><td>Phasor domain representation</td></tr><tr><td>Vmcos(ωt + φ)</td><td>Vm/φ</td></tr><tr><td>Vmsin(ωt + φ)</td><td>Vm/φ - 90°</td></tr><tr><td>Imcos(ωt + θ)</td><td>Im/θ</td></tr><tr><td>Imsin(ωt + θ)</td><td>Im/θ - 90°</td></tr></table>

Note that in Eq. (9.25) the frequency (or time) factor  $e^{j\omega t}$  is suppressed, and the frequency is not explicitly shown in the phasor domain representation because  $\omega$  is constant. However, the response depends on  $\omega$ . For this reason, the phasor domain is also known as the frequency domain.

From Eqs. (9.23) and (9.24),  $\nu (t) = \mathrm{Re}(\mathbf{V}e^{j\omega t}) = V_{m}\cos (\omega t + \phi)$ , so that

$$
\begin{aligned} \frac{d\nu}{dt} & = -\omega V_{m}\sin (\omega t + \phi) = \omega V_{m}\cos (\omega t + \phi + 90^{\circ}) \\ & = \mathrm{Re}(\omega V_{m}e^{j\omega t}e^{j\phi}e^{j90^{\circ}}) = \mathrm{Re}(j\omega \mathbf{V}e^{j\omega t}) \end{aligned} \tag{9.26}
$$

This shows that the derivative  $\nu (t)$  is transformed to the phasor domain as  $j\omega \mathbf{V}$

Differentiating a sinusoid is equivalent to multiplying its corresponding phasor by  $j\omega$ .

$$
\begin{array}{c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c} & \frac{d\nu}{d t} & & \Leftrightarrow & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & \\ & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & \end{array} \tag{9.27}
$$

Similarly, the integral of  $\nu (t)$  is transformed to the phasor domain as  $\mathbf{V} / j\omega$

$$
\begin{array}{c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c c} & \frac{\mathrm{~V~}}{\mathrm{~j~}\omega} & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & & &  \end{array} \tag{9.28}
$$

Integrating a sinusoid is equivalent to dividing its corresponding phasor by  $j\omega$ .

Equation (9.27) allows the replacement of a derivative with respect to time with multiplication of  $j\omega$  in the phasor domain, whereas Eq. (9.28) allows the replacement of an integral with respect to time with division by  $j\omega$  in the phasor domain. Equations (9.27) and (9.28) are useful in finding the steady- state solution, which does not require knowing the initial values of the variable involved. This is one of the important applications of phasors.

Besides time differentiation and integration, another important use of phasors is found in summing sinusoids of the same frequency. This is best illustrated with an example, and Example 9.6 provides one.

The differences between  $\nu (t)$  and  $\mathbf{V}$  should be emphasized:

1.  $\nu (t)$  is the instantaneous or time domain representation, while  $\mathbf{V}$  is the frequency or phasor domain representation.

2.  $\nu (t)$  is time dependent, while  $\mathbf{V}$  is not. (This fact is often forgotten by students.)

3.  $\nu (t)$  is always real with no complex term, while  $\mathbf{V}$  is generally complex.

Finally, we should bear in mind that phasor analysis applies only when frequency is constant; it applies in manipulating two or more sinusoidal signals only if they are of the same frequency.

Example 9.3

\begin{array}{l}{{(40\big/50^{\circ}+20\big/{-30^{\circ}})^{1/2}}}\\ {{\frac{10\big/{-30^{\circ}}+(3-j4)}{(2+j4)(3-j5)^{*}}}}\end{array}
$$

(a) Using polar to rectangular transformation,

$$
40 / 50^{\circ} = 40(\cos 50^{\circ} + j\sin 50^{\circ}) = 25.71 + j30.64
$$

$$
20 / - 30^{\circ} = 20[\cos (-30^{\circ}) + j\sin (-30^{\circ})] = 17.32 - j10
$$

Adding them up gives

$$
40 / 50^{\circ} + 20 / - 30^{\circ} = 43.03 + j20.64 = 47.72 / 25.63^{\circ}
$$

Taking the square root of this,

$$
(40\underline{{/50^{\circ}}} +20\underline{{/ - 30^{\circ}}})^{1 / 2} = 6.91\underline{{/12.81^{\circ}}}
$$

(b) Using polar-rectangular transformation, addition, multiplication, and division,

$$
{\begin{array}{r l}&{{\frac{10/-30^{\circ}+(3-j4)}{(2+j4)(3-j5)^{*}}}={\frac{8.66-j5+(3-j4)}{(2+j4)(3+j5)}}}\\ &{\qquad={\frac{11.66-j9}{-14+j22}}={\frac{14.73/-37.66^{\circ}}{26.08/122.47^{\circ}}}}\\ &{\qquad=0.565/-160.13^{\circ}}\end{array}}
$$

Practice Problem 9.3 Evaluate the following complex numbers:

(a)  $[(5 + j2)(-1 + j4) - 5\underline{{/60^{\circ}}}]^{*}$

(b)  $\frac{10 + j5 + 3\underline{{/40^{\circ}}}}{-3 + j4} +10\underline{{/30^{\circ}}} +j5$

Answer: (a)  $- 15.5 - j13.67$  , (b)  $8.293 + j7.2$

Example 9.4 Transform these sinusoids to phasors:

(a)  $i = 6\cos (50t - 40^{\circ})$  A

(b)  $\nu = -4\sin (30t + 50^{\circ})$  V

# Solution:

(a)  $i = 6\cos (50t - 40^{\circ})$  has the phasor

$$
\mathbf{I} = 6 / -40^{\circ}\mathrm{~A~}
$$

(b) Since  $-\sin A = \cos (A + 90^{\circ})$

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{\nu=-4\sin(30t+50^{\circ})=4\cos(30t+50^{\circ}+90^{\circ})}}\\ {{=4\cos(30t+140^{\circ})\mathrm{~V~}}}\end{array}
$$

The phasor form of  $\nu$  is

$$
\mathbf{V} = 4\underline{{/140^{\circ}}}\mathbf{V}
$$

Practice Problem 9.4 Express these sinusoids as phasors:

(a)  $\nu = 7\cos (2t + 40^{\circ})$  V

(b)  $i = -4\sin (10t + 10^{\circ})$  A

Answer: (a)  $\mathbf{V} = 7\underline{{/40^{\circ}}}\mathbf{V},$  (b)  $\mathbf{I} = 4\underline{{/100^{\circ}}}$  A.

Find the sinusoids represented by these phasors:

(a)  $\mathbf{I} = -3 + j4$  A

(b)  $\mathbf{V} = j8e^{-j20^{\circ}}$  V

# Solution:

(a)  $\mathbf{I} = -3 + j4 = 5 / 126.87^{\circ}$ . Transforming this to the time domain gives

$$
i(t) = 5\cos (\omega t + 126.87^{\circ})\mathrm{A}
$$

(b) Because  $j = 1 / 90^{\circ}$

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{\mathbf{V}=j8\underline{{/}}-20^{\circ}=(1\underline{{/}}90^{\circ})(8\underline{{/}}-20^{\circ})}}\\ {{=8\underline{{/}}90^{\circ}-20^{\circ}=8\underline{{/}}70^{\circ}\mathrm{~V~}}}\end{array}
$$

Converting this to the time domain gives

$$
\nu (t) = 8\cos (\omega t + 70^{\circ})\mathrm{V}
$$

Find the sinusoids corresponding to these phasors:

(a)  $\mathbf{V} = -25\underline{{/}} 40^{\circ}$  V 
(b)  $\mathbf{I} = j(12 - j5)$  A

Answer: (a)  $\nu (t) = 25\cos (\omega t - 140^{\circ})$  V or  $25\cos (\omega t + 220^{\circ})$  V,

(b)  $i(t) = 13\cos (\omega t + 67.38^{\circ})$  A.

Given  $i_{1}(t) = 4\cos (\omega t + 30^{\circ})$  A and  $i_{2}(t) = 5\sin (\omega t - 20^{\circ})$  A, find their sum.

# Solution:

Here is an important use of phasors—for summing sinusoids of the same frequency. Current  $i_{1}(t)$  is in the standard form. Its phasor is

$$
\mathbf{I}_{1} = 4\underline{{/}} 30^{\circ}
$$

We need to express  $i_{2}(t)$  in cosine form. The rule for converting sine to cosine is to subtract  $90^{\circ}$ . Hence,

$$
i_{2} = 5\cos (\omega t - 20^{\circ} - 90^{\circ}) = 5\cos (\omega t - 110^{\circ})
$$

and its phasor is

$$
\mathbf{I}_{2} = 5\underline{{/}} -110^{\circ}
$$

If we let  $i = i_{1} + i_{2}$ , then

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{\mathbf{I}=\mathbf{I}_{1}+\mathbf{I}_{2}=4\underline{{/}}30^{\circ}+5\underline{{/}}-110^{\circ}}}\\ {{=3.464+j2-1.71-j4.698=1.754-j2.698}}\\ {{=3.218\underline{{/}}-56.97^{\circ}\mathrm{~A~}}}\end{array}
$$

Transforming this to the time domain, we get

$$
i(t) = 3.218\cos (\omega t - 56.97^{\circ})\mathrm{~A~}
$$

Of course, we can find  $i_{1} + i_{2}$  using Eq. (9.9), but that is the hard way.

# Practice Problem 9.6

If  $\nu_{1} = - 10\sin (\omega t - 30^{\circ})$  V and  $\nu_{2} = 20\cos (\omega t + 45^{\circ})$  V, find  $\nu =$ $\nu_{1} + \nu_{2}$

Answer:  $\nu (t) = 29.77\cos (\omega t + 49.98^{\circ})$  V.

# Example 9.7

Using the phasor approach, determine the current  $i(t)$  in a circuit described by the integrodifferential equation

$$
4i + 8\int i d t - 3\frac{d i}{d t} = 50\cos (2t + 75^{\circ})
$$

# Solution:

We transform each term in the equation from time domain to phasor domain. Keeping Eqs. (9.27) and (9.28) in mind, we obtain the phasor form of the given equation as

$$
4\mathbf{I} + \frac{8\mathbf{I}}{j\omega} -3j\omega \mathbf{I} = 50\underline{{75^{\circ}}}
$$

But  $\omega = 2$  , so

$$
\mathbf{I}(4 - j4 - j6) = 50\underline{{75^{\circ}}}
$$

$$
\mathbf{I} = \frac{50 / 75^{\circ}}{4 - j10} = \frac{50 / 75^{\circ}}{10.77 / - 68.2^{\circ}} = 4.642\underline{{143.2^{\circ}}}\mathrm{~A~}
$$

Converting this to the time domain,

$$
i(t) = 4.642\cos (2t + 143.2^{\circ})\mathrm{~A~}
$$

Keep in mind that this is only the steady- state solution, and it does not require knowing the initial values.

# Practice Problem 9.7

Find the voltage  $\nu (t)$  in a circuit described by the integrodifferential equation

$$
2\frac{d\nu}{d t} +5\nu +10\int \nu d t = 50\cos (5t - 30^{\circ})
$$

using the phasor approach.

Answer:  $\nu (t) = 5.3\cos (5t - 88^{\circ})$  V.

# 9.4 Phasor Relationships for Circuit Elements

Now that we know how to represent a voltage or current in the phasor or frequency domain, one may legitimately ask how we apply this to circuits involving the passive elements  $R,L,$  and  $C$  . What we need to do is to transform the voltage- current relationship from the time domain to the frequency domain for each element. Again, we will assume the passive sign convention.

We begin with the resistor. If the current through a resistor  $R$  is  $i = I_{m}\cos (\omega t + \phi)$  , the voltage across it is given by Ohm's law as

$$
\nu = i R = R I_{m}\mathrm{cos}(\omega t + \phi) \tag{9.29}
$$

The phasor form of this voltage is

$$
\mathbf{V} = R I_{m} / \phi \tag{9.30}
$$

But the phasor representation of the current is  $\mathbf{I} = \mathbf{I}_{m} / \phi$  . Hence,

$$
\mathbf{V} = R\mathbf{I} \tag{9.31}
$$

showing that the voltage- current relation for the resistor in the phasor domain continues to be Ohm's law, as in the time domain. Figure 9.9 illustrates the voltage- current relations of a resistor. We should note from Eq. (9.31) that voltage and current are in phase, as illustrated in the phasor diagram in Fig. 9.10.

For the inductor  $L$  , assume the current through it is  $i =$ $I_{m}\cos (\omega t + \phi)$  . The voltage across the inductor is

$$
\nu = L\frac{d i}{d t} = -\omega L I_{m}\sin (\omega t + \phi) \tag{9.32}
$$

Recall from Eq. (9.10) that  $- \sin A = \cos (A + 90^{\circ})$  . We can write the voltage as

$$
\nu = \omega L I_{m}\cos (\omega t + \phi +90^{\circ}) \tag{9.33}
$$

which transforms to the phasor

$$
\mathbf{V} = \omega L I_{m}e^{j(\phi +90^{\circ})} = \omega L I_{m}e^{j\phi}e^{j90^{\circ}} = \omega L I_{m} / \phi +90^{\circ} \tag{9.34}
$$

But  $I_{m} / \phi = \mathbf{I}$  and from Eq. (9.19),  $e^{j90^{\circ}} = j$  Thus,

$$
\mathbf{V} = j\omega L\mathbf{I} \tag{9.35}
$$

showing that the voltage has a magnitude of  $\omega L I_{m}$  and a phase of  $\phi +90^{\circ}$  . The voltage and current are  $90^{\circ}$  out of phase. Specifically, the current lags the voltage by  $90^{\circ}$  . Figure 9.11 shows the voltage- current relations for the inductor. Figure 9.12 shows the phasor diagram.

For the capacitor  $C$  , assume the voltage across it is  $\nu =$ $V_{m}\cos (\omega t + \phi)$  . The current through the capacitor is

$$
i = C\frac{d\nu}{d t} \tag{9.36}
$$

By following the same steps as we took for the inductor or by applying Eq. (9.27) on Eq. (9.36), we obtain

$$
\mathbf{I} = j\omega C\mathbf{V}\qquad \Rightarrow \qquad \mathbf{V} = \frac{\mathbf{I}}{j\omega C} \tag{9.37}
$$

The voltage  $\nu = 12\cos (60t + 45^{\circ})$  is applied to a 0.1- H inductor. Find the steady- state current through the inductor.

# Solution:

For the inductor,  $\mathbf{V} = j\omega L\mathbf{I}$ , where  $\omega = 60$  rad/s and  $\mathbf{V} = 12\sqrt{45^{\circ}\mathbf{V}}$ . Hence,

$$
\mathbf{I} = \frac{\mathbf{V}}{j\omega L} = \frac{12\sqrt{45^{\circ}}}{j60\times 0.1} = \frac{12\sqrt{45^{\circ}}}{6\sqrt{90^{\circ}}} = 2\sqrt{-45^{\circ}}\mathbf{A}
$$

Converting this to the time domain,

$$
i(t) = 2\cos (60t - 45^{\circ})\mathrm{A}
$$

# Practice Problem 9.8

If voltage  $\nu = 10\cos (100t + 30^{\circ})$ $V$  is applied to a  $50\mu \mathrm{F}$  capacitor, calculate the current through the capacitor.

Answer:  $50\cos (100t + 120^{\circ})\mathrm{mA}$ .

# 9.5 Impedance and Admittance

In the preceding section, we obtained the voltage- current relations for the three passive elements as

$$
\mathbf{V} = R\mathbf{I},\qquad \mathbf{V} = j\omega L\mathbf{I},\qquad \mathbf{V} = \frac{\mathbf{I}}{j\omega C} \tag{9.38}
$$

These equations may be written in terms of the ratio of the phasor voltage to the phasor current as

$$
\frac{\mathbf{V}}{\mathbf{I}} = R,\qquad \frac{\mathbf{V}}{\mathbf{I}} = j\omega L,\qquad \frac{\mathbf{V}}{\mathbf{I}} = \frac{1}{j\omega C} \tag{9.39}
$$

From these three expressions, we obtain Ohm's law in phasor form for any type of element as

$$
\mathbf{Z} = \frac{\mathbf{V}}{\mathbf{I}}\qquad \mathrm{or}\qquad \mathbf{V} = \mathbf{Z}\mathbf{I} \tag{9.40}
$$

where  $\mathbf{Z}$  is a frequency- dependent quantity known as impedance, measured in ohms.

The impedance  $\mathbf{Z}$  of a circuit is the ratio of the phasor voltage  $\mathbf{V}$  to the phasor current  $\mathbf{I}$ , measured in ohms  $(\Omega)$ .

The impedance represents the opposition that the circuit exhibits to the flow of sinusoidal current. Although the impedance is the ratio of two phasors, it is not a phasor, because it does not correspond to a sinusoidally varying quantity.

The impedances of resistors, inductors, and capacitors can be readily obtained from Eq. (9.39). Table 9.3 summarizes their impedances. From the table we notice that  $\mathbf{Z}_{L} = j\omega L$  and  $\mathbf{Z}_{C} = - j / \omega C$ . Consider two extreme cases of angular frequency. When  $\omega = 0$  (i.e., for dc sources),  $\mathbf{Z}_{L} = 0$  and  $\mathbf{Z}_{C} \rightarrow \infty$ , confirming what we already know—that the inductor acts like a short circuit, while the capacitor acts like an open circuit. When  $\omega \rightarrow \infty$  (i.e., for high frequencies),  $\mathbf{Z}_{L} \rightarrow \infty$  and  $\mathbf{Z}_{C} = 0$ , indicating that the inductor is an open circuit to high frequencies, while the capacitor is a short circuit. Figure 9.15 illustrates this.

As a complex quantity, the impedance may be expressed in rectangular form as

$$
\mathbf{Z} = R\pm jX \tag{9.41}
$$

where  $R = \operatorname {Re}\mathbf{Z}$  is the resistance and  $X = \operatorname {Im}\mathbf{Z}$  is the reactance. The reactance,  $X$ , is just a magnitude, a positive value, but when used as a vector, a  $j$  is associated with inductance and a  $- j$  is associated with capacitance. Thus, impedance  $\mathbf{Z} = R + jX$  is said to be inductive or lagging since current lags voltage, while impedance  $\mathbf{Z} = R - jX$  is capacitive or leading because current leads voltage. The impedance, resistance, and reactance are all measured in ohms. The impedance may also be expressed in polar form as

$$
\mathbf{Z} = |\mathbf{Z}| / \theta \tag{9.42}
$$

Figure 9.15 Equivalent circuits at dc and high frequencies: (a) inductor, (b) capacitor.

Comparing Eqs. (9.41) and (9.42), we infer that

$$
\mathbf{Z} = R\pm jX = |\mathbf{Z}| / \theta \tag{9.43}
$$

where

$$
|\mathbf{Z}| = \sqrt{R^{2} + X^{2}},\qquad \theta = \tan^{-1}\frac{\pm X}{R} \tag{9.44}
$$

and

$$
R = |\mathbf{Z}|\cos \theta ,\qquad X = |\mathbf{Z}|\sin \theta \tag{9.45}
$$

It is sometimes convenient to work with the reciprocal of impedance, known as admittance.

The admittance  $\mathbf{Y}$  is the reciprocal of impedance, measured in. siemens (S).

The admittance  $\mathbf{Y}$  of an element (or a circuit) is the ratio of the phasor current through it to the phasor voltage across it, or

$$
\mathbf{Y} = \frac{1}{\mathbf{Z}} = \frac{\mathbf{I}}{\mathbf{V}} \tag{9.46}
$$

The admittances of resistors, inductors, and capacitors can be obtained from Eq. (9.39). They are also summarized in Table 9.3.

As a complex quantity, we may write  $\mathbf{Y}$  as

$$
\mathbf{Y} = G + jB \tag{9.47}
$$

where  $G = \operatorname {Re}\mathbf{Y}$  is called the conductance and  $B = \operatorname {Im}\mathbf{Y}$  is called the susceptance. Admittance, conductance, and susceptance are all expressed in the unit of siemens (or mhos). From Eqs. (9.41) and (9.47),

$$
G + jB = \frac{1}{R + jX} \tag{9.48}
$$

By rationalization,

$$
G + jB = \frac{1}{R + jX}\cdot \frac{R - jX}{R - jX} = \frac{R - jX}{R^2 + X^2} \tag{9.49}
$$

Equating the real and imaginary parts gives

$$
G = \frac{R}{R^{2} + X^{2}},\qquad B = -\frac{X}{R^{2} + X^{2}} \tag{9.50}
$$

showing that  $G\neq 1 / R$  as it is in resistive circuits. Of course, if  $X = 0$  then  $G = 1 / R$

Find  $\nu (t)$  and  $i(t)$  in the circuit shown in Fig. 9.16.

# Solution:

From the voltage source  $10\cos 4t$ ,  $\omega = 4$ ,

$$
\mathbf{V}_{s} = 10 / 0^{\circ}\mathbf{V}
$$

The impedance is

$$
\mathbf{Z} = 5 + \frac{1}{j\omega C} = 5 + \frac{1}{j4\times 0.1} = 5 - j2.5\Omega
$$

Hence the current

$$
\begin{array}{l}{{\bf I} = \frac{{\bf V}_{s}}{{\bf Z}} = \frac{10 / 0^{\circ}}{5 - j2.5} = \frac{10(5 + j2.5)}{5^{2} + 2.5^{2}}}\\ {= 1.6 + j0.8 = 1.789 / 26.57^{\circ}\mathrm{A}} \end{array} \tag{9.9.1}
$$

The voltage across the capacitor is

$$
\begin{array}{r l} & {\mathbf{V} = \mathbf{I}\mathbf{Z}_{C} = \frac{\mathbf{I}}{j\omega C} = \frac{1.789 / 26.57^{\circ}}{j4\times 0.1}}\\ & {\qquad = \frac{1.789 / 26.57^{\circ}}{0.4 / 90^{\circ}} = 4.47\underline{{/ - 63.43^{\circ}}}\mathbf{V}} \end{array} \tag{9.9.2}
$$

Converting  $\mathbf{I}$  and  $\mathbf{V}$  in Eqs. (9.9.1) and (9.9.2) to the time domain, we get

$$
\begin{array}{r}{i(t) = 1.789\cos (4t + 26.57^{\circ})\mathrm{A}}\\ {\nu (t) = 4.47\cos (4t - 63.43^{\circ})\mathrm{V}} \end{array}
$$

Notice that  $i(t)$  leads  $\nu (t)$  by  $90^{\circ}$  as expected.

Refer to Fig. 9.17. Determine  $\nu (t)$  and  $i(t)$ .

Answer:  $8.944\sin (10t + 93.43^{\circ})\mathrm{V}, 4.472\sin (10t + 3.43^{\circ})\mathrm{A}$ .

# 9.6 Kirchhoff's Laws in the Frequency Domain

We cannot do circuit analysis in the frequency domain without Kirchhoff's current and voltage laws. Therefore, we need to express them in the frequency domain.

For KVL, let  $\nu_{1}, \nu_{2}, \ldots , \nu_{n}$  be the voltages around a closed loop. Then

$$
\nu_{1} + \nu_{2} + \dots +\nu_{n} = 0 \tag{9.51}
$$

In the sinusoidal steady state, each voltage may be written in cosine form, so that Eq. (9.51) becomes

$$
\begin{array}{r l} & {V_{m1}\cos (\omega t + \theta_{1}) + V_{m2}\cos (\omega t + \theta_{2})}\\ & {\qquad +\dots +V_{m n}\cos (\omega t + \theta_{n}) = 0} \end{array} \tag{9.52}
$$

This can be written as

$$
\mathrm{Re}(V_{m1}e^{i\theta_1}e^{j\omega t}) + \mathrm{Re}(V_{m2}e^{i\theta_2}e^{j\omega t}) + \dots +\mathrm{Re}(V_{mn}e^{i\theta_n}e^{j\omega t}) = 0
$$

or

$$
\mathrm{Re}[(V_{m1}e^{j\theta_1} + V_{m2}e^{j\theta_2} + \dots + V_{mn}e^{j\theta_n}e^{j\omega t}] = 0 \tag{9.53}
$$

If we let  $\mathbf{V}_k = V_{mn}e^{j\theta_k}$ , then

$$
\mathrm{Re}[(\mathbf{V}_1 + \mathbf{V}_2 + \dots + \mathbf{V}_n)e^{j\omega t}] = 0 \tag{9.54}
$$

Because  $e^{j\omega t} \neq 0$

$$
\mathbf{V}_1 + \mathbf{V}_2 + \dots + \mathbf{V}_n = 0 \tag{9.55}
$$

indicating that Kirchhoff's voltage law holds for phasors.

By following a similar procedure, we can show that Kirchhoff's current law holds for phasors. If we let  $i_1, i_2, \ldots , i_n$  be the current leaving or entering a closed surface in a network at time  $t$ , then

$$
i_1 + i_2 + \dots + i_n = 0 \tag{9.56}
$$

If  $\mathbf{I}_1, \mathbf{I}_2, \ldots , \mathbf{I}_n$  are the phasor forms of the sinusoids  $i_1, i_2, \ldots , i_n$ , then

$$
\mathbf{I}_1 + \mathbf{I}_2 + \dots + \mathbf{I}_n = 0 \tag{9.57}
$$

which is Kirchhoff's current law in the frequency domain.

Once we have shown that both KVL and KCL hold in the frequency domain, it is easy to do many things, such as impedance combination, nodal and mesh analyses, superposition, and source transformation.

# 9.7 Impedance Combinations

Consider the  $N$  series- connected impedances shown in Fig. 9.18. The same current  $\mathbf{I}$  flows through the impedances. Applying KVL around the loop gives

$$
\mathbf{V} = \mathbf{V}_1 + \mathbf{V}_2 + \dots + \mathbf{V}_N = \mathbf{I}(\mathbf{Z}_1 + \mathbf{Z}_2 + \dots + \mathbf{Z}_N) \tag{9.58}
$$

Figure 9.18  $N$  impedances in series.

The equivalent impedance at the input terminals is

$$
\mathbf{Z}_{\mathrm{eq}} = \frac{\mathbf{V}}{\mathbf{I}} = \mathbf{Z}_1 + \mathbf{Z}_2 + \dots + \mathbf{Z}_N
$$

or

$$
\mathbf{Z}_{\mathrm{eq}} = \mathbf{Z}_1 + \mathbf{Z}_2 + \dots + \mathbf{Z}_N \tag{9.59}
$$

showing that the total or equivalent impedance of series- connected impedances is the sum of the individual impedances. This is similar to the series connection of resistances.

If  $N = 2$  , as shown in Fig. 9.19, the current through the impedances is

$$
\mathbf{I} = \frac{\mathbf{V}}{\mathbf{Z}_{1} + \mathbf{Z}_{2}} \tag{9.60}
$$

Because  $\mathbf{V}_{1} = \mathbf{Z}_{1}\mathbf{I}$  and  $\mathbf{V}_{2} = \mathbf{Z}_{2}\mathbf{I}$  , then

$$
\mathbf{V}_{1} = \frac{\mathbf{Z}_{1}}{\mathbf{Z}_{1} + \mathbf{Z}_{2}}\mathbf{V},\qquad \mathbf{V}_{2} = \frac{\mathbf{Z}_{2}}{\mathbf{Z}_{1} + \mathbf{Z}_{2}}\mathbf{V} \tag{9.61}
$$

which is the voltage- division relationship.

In the same manner, we can obtain the equivalent impedance or admittance of the  $N$  parallel- connected impedances shown in Fig. 9.20. The voltage across each impedance is the same. Applying KCL at the top node,

$$
\mathbf{I} = \mathbf{I}_{1} + \mathbf{I}_{2} + \dots +\mathbf{I}_{N} = \mathbf{V}\left(\frac{1}{\mathbf{Z}_{1}} +\frac{1}{\mathbf{Z}_{2}} +\dots +\frac{1}{\mathbf{Z}_{N}}\right) \tag{9.62}
$$

Figure 9.20  $N$  impedances in parallel.

The equivalent impedance is

$$

$$

and the equivalent admittance is

$$
\mathbf{Y}_{\mathrm{eq}} = \mathbf{Y}_{1} + \mathbf{Y}_{2} + \dots +\mathbf{Y}_{N} \tag{9.64}
$$

This indicates that the equivalent admittance of a parallel connection of admittances is the sum of the individual admittances.

When  $N = 2$  , as shown in Fig. 9.21, the equivalent impedance becomes

$$
\mathbf{Z}_{\mathrm{eq}} = \frac{1}{\mathbf{Y}_{\mathrm{eq}}} = \frac{1}{\mathbf{Y}_{1} + \mathbf{Y}_{2}} = \frac{1}{1 / \mathbf{Z}_{1} + 1 / \mathbf{Z}_{2}} = \frac{\mathbf{Z}_{1}\mathbf{Z}_{2}}{\mathbf{Z}_{1} + \mathbf{Z}_{2}} \tag{9.65}

Also, since

$$
\mathbf{V} = \mathbf{I}\mathbf{Z}_{\mathrm{eq}} = \mathbf{I}_1\mathbf{Z}_1 = \mathbf{I}_2\mathbf{Z}_2
$$

the currents in the impedances are

$$
\mathbf{I}_1 = \frac{\mathbf{Z}_2}{\mathbf{Z}_1 + \mathbf{Z}_2}\mathbf{I},\qquad \mathbf{I}_2 = \frac{\mathbf{Z}_1}{\mathbf{Z}_1 + \mathbf{Z}_2}\mathbf{I} \tag{9.66}
$$

which is the current- division principle.

The delta- to- wye and wye- to- delta transformations that we applied to resistive circuits are also valid for impedances. With reference to Fig. 9.22, the conversion formulas are as follows.

$$

$$
\begin{array}{r}\mathbf{Z}_1 = \frac{\mathbf{Z}_b\mathbf{Z}_c}{\mathbf{Z}_a + \mathbf{Z}_b + \mathbf{Z}_c}\\ \mathbf{Z}_2 = \frac{\mathbf{Z}_c\mathbf{Z}_a}{\mathbf{Z}_a + \mathbf{Z}_b + \mathbf{Z}_c}\\ \mathbf{Z}_3 = \frac{\mathbf{Z}_a\mathbf{Z}_b}{\mathbf{Z}_a + \mathbf{Z}_b + \mathbf{Z}_c} \end{array} \tag{9.68}
$$

A delta or wye circuit is said to be balanced if it has equal impedances in all three branches.

When a  $\Delta - Y$  circuit is balanced, Eqs. (9.67) and (9.68) become

$$
\mathbf{Z}_{\Delta} = 3\mathbf{Z}_{Y}\qquad \mathrm{or}\qquad \mathbf{Z}_{Y} = \frac{1}{3}\mathbf{Z}_{\Delta} \tag{9.69}
$$

where  $\mathbf{Z}_{Y} = \mathbf{Z}_{1} = \mathbf{Z}_{2} = \mathbf{Z}_{3}$  and  $\mathbf{Z}_{\Delta} = \mathbf{Z}_{a} = \mathbf{Z}_{b} = \mathbf{Z}_{c}$ .

As you see in this section, the principles of voltage division, current division, circuit reduction, impedance equivalence, and  $Y - \Delta$  transformation all apply to ac circuits. Chapter 10 will show that other circuit techniques—such as superposition, nodal analysis, mesh analysis, source transformation, the Thevenin theorem, and the Norton theorem—are all applied to ac circuits in a manner similar to their application in dc circuits.

Find the input impedance of the circuit in Fig. 9.23. Assume that the circuit operates at  $\omega = 50$  rad/s.

# Solution:

Let

$\mathbf{Z}_{1} =$  Impedance of the  $2 - \mathrm{mF}$  capacitor

$\mathbf{Z}_{2} =$  Impedance of the  $3 - \Omega$  resistor in series with the  $10 - \mathrm{mF}$  capacitor

$\mathbf{Z}_{3} =$  Impedance of the  $0.2 - \mathrm{H}$  inductor in series with the  $8 - \Omega$  resistor

Then

$$
\mathbf{Z}_{1} = \frac{1}{j\omega C} = \frac{1}{j50\times 2\times 10^{-3}} = -j10\Omega
$$

$$
\mathbf{Z}_{2} = 3 + \frac{1}{j\omega C} = 3 + \frac{1}{j50\times 10\times 10^{-3}} = (3 - j2)\Omega
$$

$$
\mathbf{Z}_{3} = 8 + j\omega L = 8 + j50\times 0.2 = (8 + j10)\Omega
$$

The input impedance is

$$
\mathbf{Z}_{\mathrm{in}} = \mathbf{Z}_{1} + \mathbf{Z}_{2}\parallel \mathbf{Z}_{3} = -j10 + \frac{(3 - j2)(8 + j10)}{11 + j8}
$$

$$
= -j10 + \frac{(44 + j14)(11 - j8)}{11^{2} + 8^{2}} = -j10 + 3.22 - j1.07\Omega
$$

Thus,

$$
\mathbf{Z}_{\mathrm{in}} = 3.22 - j11.07\Omega
$$

Figure 9.26 The frequency domain equivalent of the circuit in Fig. 9.25.

Let

Then  $\mathbf{Z}_{1} = 60 \Omega$  and

$$
\mathbf{Z}_{2} = -j25 \parallel j20 = \frac{-j25 \times j20}{-j25 + j20} = j100 \Omega
$$

By the voltage- division principle,

$$
\begin{array}{r l} & {\mathbf{V}_{o} = \frac{\mathbf{Z}_{2}}{\mathbf{Z}_{1} + \mathbf{Z}_{2}}\mathbf{V}_{s} = \frac{j100}{60 + j100} (20\underline{{/ - 15^{\circ}}})}\\ & {\quad = (0.8575\underline{{/30.96^{\circ}}})(20\underline{{/ - 15^{\circ}}}) = 17.15\underline{{/15.96^{\circ}}}\mathbf{V}} \end{array}
$$

We convert this to the time domain and obtain

$$
\nu_{o}(t) = 17.15 \cos (4t + 15.96^{\circ}) \mathrm{V}
$$

$$
\mathbf{Z}_{an} = \frac{j4(2 - j4)}{j4 + 2 - j4 + 8} = \frac{4(4 + j2)}{10} = (1.6 + j0.8) \Omega

$$

$$

The total impedance at the source terminals is

$$
\begin{array}{r l} & {\mathbf{Z} = 12 + \mathbf{Z}_{a n} + (\mathbf{Z}_{b n} - j3)\parallel (\mathbf{Z}_{c n} + j6 + 8)}\\ & {\qquad = 12 + 1.6 + j0.8 + (j0.2)\parallel (9.6 + j2.8)}\\ & {\qquad = 13.6 + j0.8 + \frac{j0.2(9.6 + j2.8)}{9.6 + j3}}\\ & {\qquad = 13.6 + j1 = 13.64\underline{{/4.204^{\circ}}}\Omega} \end{array}
$$

The desired current is

$$
\mathbf{I} = \frac{\mathbf{V}}{\mathbf{Z}} = \frac{50 / 0^{\circ}}{13.64 / 4.204^{\circ}} = 3.666 / - 4.204^{\circ} \mathrm{A}

# 9.8 Applications

In Chapters 7 and 8, we saw certain uses of  $RC$ ,  $RL$ , and  $RLC$  circuits in dc applications. These circuits also have ac applications; among them are coupling circuits, phase- shifting circuits, filters, resonant circuits, ac bridge circuits, and transformers. This list of applications is inexhaustive. We will consider some of them later. It will suffice here to observe two simple ones:  $RC$  phase- shifting circuits, and ac bridge circuits.

# 9.8.1 Phase-Shifters

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-13/c95faf42-d8e0-4f06-a665-945fc5e108f1/331b02720d2c7960c4a7294279375de7d5c15f06760035eca47186acfdfd317c.jpg)  
Figure 9.31 Series  $RC$  shift circuits: (a) leading output, (b) lagging output.

A phase- shifting circuit is often employed to correct an undesirable phase shift already present in a circuit or to produce special desired effects. An  $RC$  circuit is suitable for this purpose because its capacitor causes the circuit current to lead the applied voltage. Two commonly used  $RC$  circuits are shown in Fig. 9.31. (RL circuits or any reactive circuits could also serve the same purpose.)

In Fig. 9.31(a), the circuit current I leads the applied voltage  $\mathbf{V}_{i}$  by some phase angle  $\theta$ , where  $0 < \theta < 90^{\circ}$ , depending on the values of  $R$  and  $C$ . If  $X_{C} = - 1 / \omega C$ , then the total impedance is  $\mathbf{Z} = R + jX_{C}$ , and the phase shift is given by

$$
\theta = \tan^{-1}\frac{X_{C}}{R} \tag{9.70}
$$

This shows that the amount of phase shift depends on the values of  $R$ ,  $C$ , and the operating frequency. Since the output voltage  $\mathbf{V}_{o}$  across the resistor is in phase with the current,  $\mathbf{V}_{o}$  leads (positive phase shift)  $\mathbf{V}_{i}$  as shown in Fig. 9.32(a).

In Fig. 9.31(b), the output is taken across the capacitor. The current I leads the input voltage  $\mathbf{V}_{i}$  by  $\theta$ , but the output voltage  $\nu_{o}(t)$  across the capacitor lags (negative phase shift) the input voltage  $\nu_{i}(t)$  as illustrated in Fig. 9.32(b).

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-13/c95faf42-d8e0-4f06-a665-945fc5e108f1/0cb282fb05475c0614e7b13006e102741c15e4ff34b0c08dfd926e229699cbe7.jpg)  
Figure 9.32 Phase shift in  $RC$  circuits: (a) leading output, (b) lagging output.

We should keep in mind that the simple  $RC$  circuits in Fig. 9.31 also act as voltage dividers. Therefore, as the phase shift  $\theta$  approaches  $90^{\circ}$ , the output voltage  $\mathbf{V}_{o}$  approaches zero. For this reason, these simple  $RC$  circuits are used only when small amounts of phase shift are required. If it is desired to have phase shifts greater than  $60^{\circ}$ , simple  $RC$  networks are cascaded, thereby providing a total phase shift equal to the sum of the individual phase shifts. In practice, the phase shifts due to the stages are not equal, because the succeeding stages load down the earlier stages unless op amps are used to separate the stages.

Design an  $RC$  circuit to provide a phase of  $90^{\circ}$  leading.

# Solution:

If we select circuit components of equal ohmic value, say  $R = |X_{C}| = 20\Omega$ , at a particular frequency, according to Eq. (9.70), the phase shift is exactly  $45^{\circ}$ . By cascading two similar  $RC$  circuits in Fig. 9.31(a), we obtain the circuit in Fig. 9.33, providing a positive or leading phase shift of  $90^{\circ}$ , as we shall soon show. Using the series- parallel combination technique,  $\mathbf{Z}$  in Fig. 9.33 is obtained as

$$
\mathbf{Z} = 20\parallel (20 - j20) = \frac{20(20 - j20)}{40 - j20} = 12 - j4\Omega \tag{9.13.1}
$$

Using voltage division,

$$
\mathbf{V}_{1} = \frac{\mathbf{Z}}{\mathbf{Z} - j20}\mathbf{V}_{i} = \frac{12 - j4}{12 - j24}\mathbf{V}_{i} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{3}\angle 45^{\circ}\mathbf{V}_{i} \tag{9.13.2}
$$

and

$$
\mathbf{V}_{o} = \frac{20}{20 - j20}\mathbf{V}_{1} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\angle 45^{\circ}\mathbf{V}_{1} \tag{9.13.3}
$$

Substituting Eq. (9.13.2) into Eq. (9.13.3) yields

$$
\mathbf{V}_{o} = \left(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\angle 45^{\circ}\right)\left(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{3}\angle 45^{\circ}\mathbf{V}_{i}\right) = \frac{1}{3}\angle 90^{\circ}\mathbf{V}_{i}
$$

Thus, the output leads the input by  $90^{\circ}$  but its magnitude is only about 33 percent of the input.

Design an  $RC$  circuit to provide a  $90^{\circ}$  lagging phase shift of the output voltage relative to the input voltage. If an ac voltage of  $60\mathrm{V}$  rms is applied, what is the output voltage?

Answer: Figure 9.34 shows a typical design;  $20\mathrm{V}$  rms.

Consider the circuit in Fig. 9.35(b). The impedance  $\mathbf{Z}$  is the parallel combination of  $j125.7\Omega$  and  $100 + j62.83\Omega$ . Hence,

$$
\begin{array}{l}{{\bf Z}=j125.7\parallel(100+j62.83)}\\{}\\{=}\frac{j125.7(100+j62.83)}{100+j188.5}=69.56\underline{{/60.1^{\circ}}}\Omega\end{array} \tag{9.14.1}
$$

Using voltage division,

$$
\begin{array}{r}{\mathbf{V}_{1} = \frac{\mathbf{Z}}{\mathbf{Z} + 150}\mathbf{V}_{i} = \frac{69.56\mathbf{\Omega} / 60.1^{\circ}}{184.7 + j60.3}\mathbf{V}_{i}}\\ {= 0.3582\mathbf{\Omega} / 42.02^{\circ}\mathbf{V}_{i}} \end{array} \tag{9.14.2}
$$

and

$$
\mathbf{V}_{o} = \frac{j62.832}{100 + j62.832}\mathbf{V}_{1} = 0.532\underline{{/57.86^{\circ}}}\mathbf{V}_{1} \tag{9.14.3}
$$

Combining Eqs. (9.14.2) and (9.14.3),

$$
\mathbf{V}_{o} = (0.532\underline{{/57.86^{\circ}}})(0.3582\underline{{/42.02^{\circ}}})\mathbf{V}_{i} = 0.1906\underline{{/100^{\circ}}}\mathbf{V}_{i}
$$

showing that the output is about 19 percent of the input in magnitude but leading the input by  $100^{\circ}$ . If the circuit is terminated by a load, the load will affect the phase shift.

# 9.8.2 AC Bridges

An ac bridge circuit is used in measuring the inductance  $L$  of an inductor or the capacitance  $C$  of a capacitor. It is similar in form to the Wheatstone bridge for measuring an unknown resistance (discussed in Section 4.10) and follows the same principle. To measure  $L$  and  $C$ , however, an ac

source is needed as well as an ac meter instead of the galvanometer. The ac meter may be a sensitive ac ammeter or voltmeter.

Consider the general ac bridge circuit displayed in Fig. 9.37. The bridge is balanced when no current flows through the meter. This means that  $\mathbf{V}_{1} = \mathbf{V}_{2}$ . Applying the voltage division principle,

$$
\mathbf{V}_{1} = \frac{\mathbf{Z}_{2}}{\mathbf{Z}_{1} + \mathbf{Z}_{2}}\mathbf{V}_{s} = \mathbf{V}_{2} = \frac{\mathbf{Z}_{x}}{\mathbf{Z}_{3} + \mathbf{Z}_{x}}\mathbf{V}_{s} \tag{9.71}
$$

Thus,

$$
\frac{\mathbf{Z}_{2}}{\mathbf{Z}_{1} + \mathbf{Z}_{2}} = \frac{\mathbf{Z}_{x}}{\mathbf{Z}_{3} + \mathbf{Z}_{x}} \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad \mathbf{Z}_{2}\mathbf{Z}_{3} = \mathbf{Z}_{1}\mathbf{Z}_{x} \tag{9.72}
$$

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-13/c95faf42-d8e0-4f06-a665-945fc5e108f1/8903d65b18e85da246e2b72055414840a9ab2020c05f7ed5fc0f1db10eb6e11e.jpg)  
Figure 9.37 A general ac bridge.

or

$$
\mathbf{Z}_{x} = \frac{\mathbf{Z}_{3}}{\mathbf{Z}_{1}}\mathbf{Z}_{2} \tag{9.73}
$$

This is the balanced equation for the ac bridge and is similar to Eq. (4.30) for the resistance bridge except that the  $R$ 's are replaced by  $\mathbf{Z}$ 's.

Specific ac bridges for measuring  $L$  and  $C$  are shown in Fig. 9.38, where  $L_{x}$  and  $C_{x}$  are the unknown inductance and capacitance to be measured while  $L_{s}$  and  $C_{s}$  are a standard inductance and capacitance (the values of which are known to be great precision). In each case, two resistors,  $R_{1}$  and  $R_{2}$ , are varied until the ac meter reads zero. Then the bridge is balanced. From Eq. (9.73), we obtain

$$
L_{x} = \frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}} L_{s} \tag{9.74}
$$

and

$$
C_{x} = \frac{R_{1}}{R_{2}} C_{s} \tag{9.75}
$$

Notice that the balancing of the ac bridges in Fig. 9.38 does not depend on the frequency  $f$  of the ac source, since  $f$  does not appear in the relationships in Eqs. (9.74) and (9.75).

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-13/c95faf42-d8e0-4f06-a665-945fc5e108f1/c87c49f7ff4c13300bb8c51f58e148cc22e713a8737bb45de8c9011e831c1ed2.jpg)  
Figure 9.38 Specific ac bridges: (a) for measuring  $L$ , (b) for measuring  $C$ .

The ac bridge circuit of Fig. 9.37 balances when  $\mathbf{Z}_{1}$  is a  $1 - \mathrm{k}\Omega$  resistor,  $\mathbf{Z}_{2}$  is a  $4.2 - \mathrm{k}\Omega$  resistor,  $\mathbf{Z}_{3}$  is a parallel combination of a  $1.5 - \mathrm{M}\Omega$  resistor and a  $12 - \mathrm{pF}$  capacitor, and  $f = 2 \mathrm{kHz}$ . Find: (a) the series components that make up  $\mathbf{Z}_{x}$ , and (b) the parallel components that make up  $\mathbf{Z}_{x}$ .

# Solution:

1. Define. The problem is clearly stated.

2. Present. We are to determine the unknown components subject to the fact that they balance the given quantities. Given that a parallel and series equivalent exists for this circuit, we need to find both.

3. Alternative. Although there are alternative techniques that can be used to find the unknown values, a straightforward equality works best. Once we have answers, we can check them by using hand techniques such as nodal analysis or just using PSpice.

4. Attempt. From Eq. (9.73),

$$
\mathbf{Z}_{x} = \frac{\mathbf{Z}_{3}}{\mathbf{Z}_{1}}\mathbf{Z}_{2} \tag{9.15.1}
$$

where  $\mathbf{Z}_{x} = R_{x} + jX_{x}$

$$
\mathbf{Z}_{1} = 1000\Omega ,\qquad \mathbf{Z}_{2} = 4200\Omega \tag{9.15.2}
$$

and

$$
\mathbf{Z}_{3} = R_{3}\parallel \frac{1}{j\omega C_{3}} = \frac{\frac{R_{3}}{j\omega C_{3}}}{R_{3} + 1 / j\omega C_{3}} = \frac{R_{3}}{1 + j\omega R_{3}C_{3}}
$$

Since  $R_{3} = 1.5 \mathrm{M}\Omega$  and  $C_{3} = 12 \mathrm{pF}$

$$
\mathbf{Z}_{3} = \frac{1.5\times10^{6}}{1 + j2\pi\times 2\times10^{3}\times 1.5\times10^{6}\times 12\times10^{-12}} = \frac{1.5\times10^{6}}{1 + j0.2262}
$$

or

$$
\mathbf{Z}_{3} = 1.427 - j0.3228 \mathrm{M}\Omega \tag{9.15.3}
$$

(a) Assuming that  $\mathbf{Z}_{x}$  is made up of series components, we substitute Eqs. (9.15.2) and (9.15.3) in Eq. (9.15.1) and obtain

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{R_{x}+j X_{x}=\frac{4200}{1000}(1.427-j0.3228)\times10^{6}}}\\ {{=(5.993-j1.356)\mathrm{M}\Omega}}\end{array} \tag{9.15.4}
$$

Equating the real and imaginary parts yields  $R_{x} = 5.993 \mathrm{M}\Omega$  and a capacitive reactance

$$
X_{x} = \frac{1}{\omega C} = 1.356\times 10^{6}
$$

or

$$
C = \frac{1}{\omega X_{x}} = \frac{1}{2\pi\times 2\times 10^{3}\times 1.356\times 10^{6}} = 58.69 \mathrm{pF}
$$

(b)  $Z_{x}$  remains the same as in Eq. (9.15.4) but  $R_{x}$  and  $X_{x}$  are in parallel. Assuming an  $RC$  parallel combination,

$$
\begin{array}{l}{\mathbf{Z}_x = (5.993 - j1.356)\mathbf{M}\Omega}\\ {= R_x\parallel \frac{1}{j\omega C_x} = \frac{R_x}{1 + j\omega R_xC_x}} \end{array}
$$

By equating the real and imaginary parts, we obtain

$$
\begin{array}{l}{R_{x} = \frac{\mathrm{Real}(\mathbf{Z}_{x})^{2} + \mathrm{Imag}(\mathbf{Z}_{x})^{2}}{\mathrm{Real}(\mathbf{Z}_{x})} = \frac{5.993^{2} + 1.356^{2}}{5.993} = 6.3\mathbf{M}\Omega}\\ {C_{x} = -\frac{\mathrm{Imag}(\mathbf{Z}_{x})}{\omega[\mathrm{Real}(\mathbf{Z}_{x})^{2} + \mathrm{Imag}(\mathbf{Z}_{x})^{2}]}}\\ {= -\frac{-1.356}{2\pi(2000)(5.917^{2} + 1.356^{2})} = 2.852\mu \mathbf{F}} \end{array}
$$

We have assumed a parallel  $RC$  combination which works in this case.

5. Evaluate. Let us now use PSpice to see if we indeed have the correct equalities. Running PSpice with the equivalent circuits, an open circuit between the "bridge" portion of the circuit, and a 10-volt input voltage yields the following voltages at the ends of the "bridge" relative to a reference at the bottom of the circuit:

$$
\begin{array}{rlr}{\mathsf{FREQ}}&{\mathsf{VM}(\Phi\mathsf{N}_{-}0002)}&{\mathsf{VP}(\Phi\mathsf{N}_{-}0002)}\\{2.000\mathsf{E}+03}&{9.993\mathsf{E}+00}&{-8.634\mathsf{E}-03}\\{2.000\mathsf{E}+03}&{9.993\mathsf{E}+00}&{-8.637\mathsf{E}-03}\end{array}
$$

Because the voltages are essentially the same, then no measurable current can flow through the "bridge" portion of the circuit for any element that connects the two points together and we have a balanced bridge, which is to be expected. This indicates we have properly determined the unknowns.

There is a very important problem with what we have done! Do you know what that is? We have what can be called an ideal, "theoretical" answer, but one that really is not very good in the real world. The difference between the magnitudes of the upper impedances and the lower impedances is much too large and would never be accepted in a real bridge circuit. For greatest accuracy, the overall magnitude of the impedances must at least be within the same relative order. To increase the accuracy of the solution of this problem, I would recommend increasing the magnitude of the top impedances to be in the range of  $500 \mathrm{k}\Omega$  to  $1.5 \mathrm{M}\Omega$ . One additional real- world comment: The size of these impedances also creates serious problems in making actual measurements, so the appropriate instruments must be used in order to minimize their loading (which would change the actual voltage readings) on the circuit.

6. Satisfactory? Because we solved for the unknown terms and then tested to see if they worked, we validated the results. They can now be presented as a solution to the problem.

# Practice Problem 9.15

In the ac bridge circuit of Fig. 9.37, suppose that balance is achieved when  $\mathbf{Z}_{1}$  is a  $4.8 - \mathrm{k}\Omega$  resistor,  $\mathbf{Z}_{2}$  is a  $10 - \Omega$  resistor in series with a  $0.25 - \mu \mathrm{H}$  inductor,  $\mathbf{Z}_{3}$  is a  $12 - \mathrm{k}\Omega$  resistor, and  $f = 6$  MHz. Determine the series components that make up  $\mathbf{Z}_{x}$ .

Answer: A  $25 - \Omega$  resistor in series with a  $0.625 - \mu \mathrm{H}$  inductor.

# 9.9 Summary

1. A sinusoid is a signal in the form of the sine or cosine function. It has the general form

$$
\nu (t) = V_{m}\cos (\omega t + \phi)
$$

where  $V_{m}$  is the amplitude,  $\omega = 2\pi f$  is the angular frequency,  $(\omega t + \phi)$  is the argument, and  $\phi$  is the phase.

2. A phasor is a complex quantity that represents both the magnitude and the phase of a sinusoid. Given the sinusoid  $\nu (t) = V_{m}\cos (\omega t + \phi)$  its phasor  $\mathbf{V}$  is

$$
\mathbf{V} = V_{m} / \underline{{\phi}}
$$

3. In ac circuits, voltage and current phasors always have a fixed relation to one another at any moment of time. If  $\nu (t) = V_{m}\cos (\omega t + \phi_{\nu})$  represents the voltage through an element and  $i(t) = I_{m}\cos (\omega t + \phi_{i})$  represents the current through the element, then  $\phi_{i} = \phi_{\nu}$  if the element is a resistor,  $\phi_{i}$  leads  $\phi_{\nu}$  by  $90^{\circ}$  if the element is a capacitor, and  $\phi_{i}$  lags  $\phi_{\nu}$  by  $90^{\circ}$  if the element is an inductor.

4. The impedance  $\mathbf{Z}$  of a circuit is the ratio of the phasor voltage across it to the phasor current through it:

$$
\mathbf{Z} = \frac{\mathbf{V}}{\mathbf{I}} = R(\omega) + jX(\omega)
$$

The admittance  $\mathbf{Y}$  is the reciprocal of impedance:

$$
\mathbf{Y} = \frac{1}{\mathbf{Z}} = G(\omega) + jB(\omega)
$$

Impedances are combined in series or in parallel the same way as resistances in series or parallel; that is, impedances in series add while admittances in parallel add.

5. For a resistor  $\mathbf{Z} = R$ , for an inductor  $\mathbf{Z} = jX = j\omega L$ , and for a capacitor  $\mathbf{Z} = -jX = 1 / j\omega C$ .

6. Basic circuit laws (Ohm's and Kirchhoff's) apply to ac circuits in the same manner as they do for dc circuits; that is,

$$
\mathbf{V} = \mathbf{Z}\mathbf{I}
$$

$$
\Sigma \mathbf{I}_k = 0 \quad (\mathrm{KCL})
$$

$$
\Sigma \mathbf{V}_k = 0 \quad (\mathrm{KVL})
$$

7. The techniques of voltage/current division, series/parallel combination of impedance/admittance, circuit reduction, and  $Y - \Delta$  transformation all apply to ac circuit analysis. 
8. AC circuits are applied in phase-shifters and bridges.

7.5  $\cos (10t + 30^{\circ})$  A and a voltage output  $120 \cos (10t + 75^{\circ}) \mathrm{V}$ . Determine the associated impedance.

9.21 Simplify the following:

$$
\begin{array}{l}{\mathrm{a})f(t) = 5\cos (2t + 15^{\circ}) - 4\sin (2t - 30^{\circ})}\\ {\mathrm{b})g(t) = 8\sin t + 4\cos (t + 50^{\circ})}\\ {\mathrm{c})h(t) = \int_{0}^{t}(10\cos 40t + 50\sin 40t)d t} \end{array}
$$

9.22 An alternating voltage is given by  $\nu (t) =$ $55\cos (5t + 45^{\circ})$  V. Use phasors to find

$$
10\nu (t) + 4\frac{d\nu}{dt} -2\int_{-\infty}^{t}\nu (t)dt
$$

Assume that the value of the integral is zero at  $t = - \infty$

9.23 Apply phasor analysis to evaluate the following:

(a)  $\nu = [110\sin (20t + 30^{\circ}) + 220\cos (20t - 90^{\circ})]$  V 
(b)  $i = [30\cos (5t + 60^{\circ}) - 20\sin (5t + 60^{\circ})]$  A

9.24 Find  $\nu (t)$  in the following integrodifferential equations using the phasor approach:

$$
\begin{array}{l}{\mathrm{a})\nu (t) + \int \nu d t = 10\cos t}\\ {\mathrm{b})\frac{d\nu}{d t} +5\nu (t) + 4\int \nu d t = 20\sin (4t + 10^{\circ})} \end{array}
$$

9.25 Using phasors, determine  $i(t)$  in the following equations:

$$
\begin{array}{l}{\mathrm{a})2\frac{d i}{d t} +3i(t) = 4\cos (2t - 45^{\circ})}\\ \mathrm{b})10\int i d t + \frac{d i}{d t} +6i(t) = 5\cos (5t + 22^{\circ})\mathrm{A}} \end{array}
$$

9.26 The loop equation for a series  $RLC$  circuit gives

$$
\frac{d i}{d t} +2i + \int_{-\infty}^{t}i d t = \cos 2t\mathrm{A}
$$

Assuming that the value of the integral at  $t = - \infty$  is zero, find  $i(t)$  using the phasor method.

9.27 A parallel  $RLC$  circuit has the node equation

$$
\frac{d\nu}{d t} +50\nu +100\int \nu d t = 110\cos (377t - 10^{\circ})\mathrm{V}
$$

Determine  $\nu (t)$  using the phasor method. You may assume that the value of the integral at  $t = - \infty$  is zero.

# Section 9.4 Phasor Relationships for Circuit Elements

9.28 Determine the current that flows through an  $15 - \Omega$  resistor connected to a voltage source  $\nu_{\mathrm{s}} = 156\cos (377t + 45^{\circ})\mathrm{V}$

9.29 Given that  $\nu_{\mathrm{s}}(0) = 2\cos (155^{\circ})\mathrm{V}$ , what is the instantaneous voltage across a  $2 - \mu \mathrm{F}$  capacitor when the current through it is  $i = 4\sin (10^{6}t + 25^{\circ})$  A?

9.30 A voltage  $\nu (t) = 100\cos (60t + 20^{\circ})\mathrm{V}$  is applied to a parallel combination of a  $40 - \mathrm{k}\Omega$  resistor and a  $50 - \mu \mathrm{F}$  capacitor. Find the steady- state currents through the resistor and the capacitor.

9.31 A series  $RLC$  circuit has  $R = 80\Omega$ ,  $L = 240\mathrm{mH}$ , and  $C = 5\mathrm{mF}$ . If the input voltage is  $\nu (t) = 10\cos (2t)\mathrm{V}$ , find the current flowing through the circuit.

# Enhancing Your Career

# Career in Software Engineering

Software engineering is that aspect of engineering that deals with the practical application of scientific knowledge in the design, construction, and validation of computer programs and the associated documentation required to develop, operate, and maintain them. It is a branch of electrical engineering that is becoming increasingly important as more and more disciplines require one form of software package or another to perform routine tasks and as programmable microelectronic systems are used in more and more applications.

The role of a software engineer should not be confused with that of a computer scientist; the software engineer is a practitioner, not a theoretician. A software engineer should have good computerprogramming skills and be familiar with programming languages, in particular  $\mathbf{C}^{+ + }$  , which is becoming increasingly popular. Because hardware and software are closely interlinked, it is essential that a software engi- . neer have a thorough understanding of hardware design. Most important, the software engineer should have some specialized knowledge of the area in which the software development skill is to be applied.

All in all, the field of software engineering offers a great career to those who enjoy programming and developing software packages. The higher rewards will go to those having the best preparation, with the most interesting and challenging opportunities going to those with graduate education.

Learning ObjectivesBy using the information and exercises in this chapter you will be able to:1. Analyze electrical circuits in the frequency domain using nodal analysis.2. Analyze electrical circuits in the frequency domain using mesh analysis.3. Apply the superposition principle to frequency domain electrical circuits.4. Apply source transformation in frequency domain circuits.5. Understand how Thevenin and Norton equivalent circuits can be used in the frequency domain.6. Analyze electrical circuits with op amps.

# 10.1 Introduction

In Chapter 9, we learned that the forced or steady- state response of circuits to sinusoidal inputs can be obtained by using phasors. We also know that Ohm's and Kirchhoff's laws are applicable to ac circuits. In this chapter, we want to see how nodal analysis, mesh analysis, Thevenin's theorem, Norton's theorem, superposition, and source transformations are applied in analyzing ac circuits. Since these techniques were already introduced for dc circuits, our major effort here will be to illustrate with examples.Analyzing ac circuits usually requires three steps.

Analyzing ac circuits usually requires three steps.

# Steps to Analyze AC Circuits:

1. Transform the circuit to the phasor or frequency domain. 
2. Solve the problem using circuit techniques (nodal analysis, mesh analysis, superposition, etc.). 
3. Transform the resulting phasor to the time domain.

Frequency domain analysis of an ac circuit via phasors is much easier than analysis of the circuit in the time domain.

Step 1 is not necessary if the problem is specified in the frequency domain. In step 2, the analysis is performed in the same manner as dc circuit analysis except that complex numbers are involved. Having read Chapter 9, we are adept at handling step 3.

Toward the end of the chapter, we learn how to apply PSpice in solving ac circuit problems. We finally apply ac circuit analysis to two practical ac circuits: oscillators and ac transistor circuits.

# 10.2 Nodal Analysis

10.2 Nodal AnalysisThe basis of nodal analysis is Kirchhoff's current law. Since KCL is valid for phasors, as demonstrated in Section 9.6, we can analyze ac circuits by nodal analysis. The following examples illustrate this.

Find  $i_{x}$  in the circuit of Fig. 10.1 using nodal analysis.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-13/c95faf42-d8e0-4f06-a665-945fc5e108f1/ee7d724753c4abd5aa62b14f9a7afa06e658da0958234023097dfbf0134c029b.jpg)  
Figure 10.1 For Example 10.1.

# Solution:

We first convert the circuit to the frequency domain:

$$
\begin{array}{r l r l}{{20\cos4t}}&{{\Rightarrow}}&{{20\underline{{/0^{\circ}}},\qquad\omega=4\mathrm{rad/s}}}\\ {{1\mathrm{~H}}}&{{\Rightarrow}}&{{j\omega L=j4}}\\ {{0.5\mathrm{~H}}}&{{\Rightarrow}}&{{j\omega L=j2}}\\ {{0.1\mathrm{~F}}}&{{\Rightarrow}}&{{\frac{1}{j\omega C}=-j2.5}}\end{array}
$$

Thus, the frequency domain equivalent circuit is as shown in Fig. 10.2.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-13/c95faf42-d8e0-4f06-a665-945fc5e108f1/cfffd2ccaa326f62e8bc33a160f145ee18061e8636e07eb632a0e96786bed207.jpg)  
Figure 10.2

Frequency domain equivalent of the circuit in Fig. 10.1.

Applying KCL at node 1,

$$
\frac{20 - \mathbf{V}_1}{10} = \frac{\mathbf{V}_1}{-j2.5} +\frac{\mathbf{V}_1 - \mathbf{V}_2}{j4}
$$

or

$$
(1 + j1.5)\mathbf{V}_1 + j2.5\mathbf{V}_2 = 20 \tag{10.1.1}
$$

At node 2,

$$
2\mathbf{I}_{x} + \frac{\mathbf{V}_{1} - \mathbf{V}_{2}}{j4} = \frac{\mathbf{V}_{2}}{j2}
$$

But  $\mathbf{I}_x = \mathbf{V}_1 / - j2.5$ . Substituting this gives

$$
\frac{2\mathbf{V}_1}{-j2.5} +\frac{\mathbf{V}_1 - \mathbf{V}_2}{j4} = \frac{\mathbf{V}_2}{j2}
$$

By simplifying, we get

$$
11\mathbf{V}_1 + 15\mathbf{V}_2 = 0 \tag{10.1.2}
$$

Equations (10.1.1) and (10.1.2) can be put in matrix form as

$$
\left[ \begin{array}{cc}1 + j1.5 & j2.5 \\ 11 & 15 \end{array} \right]\left[ \begin{array}{c}\mathbf{V}_1 \\ \mathbf{V}_2 \end{array} \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{c}20 \\ 0 \end{array} \right]
$$

We obtain the determinants as

$$
\Delta = \left| \begin{array}{cc}1 + j1.5 & j2.5 \\ 11 & 15 \end{array} \right| = 15 - j5
$$

$$
\Delta_{1} = \left| \begin{array}{cc}20 & j2.5 \\ 0 & 15 \end{array} \right| = 300, \qquad \Delta_{2} = \left| \begin{array}{cc}1 + j1.5 & 20 \\ 11 & 0 \end{array} \right| = -220
$$

$$
\mathbf{V}_{1} = \frac{\Delta_{1}}{\Delta} = \frac{300}{15 - j5} = 18.97 \frac{18.43^{\circ}}{198.3^{\circ}} \mathbf{V}
$$

$$
\mathbf{V}_{2} = \frac{\Delta_{2}}{\Delta} = \frac{-220}{15 - j5} = 13.91 \frac{198.3^{\circ}}{198.3^{\circ}} \mathbf{V}
$$

The current  $\mathbf{I}_{x}$  is given by

$$
\mathbf{I}_{x} = \frac{\mathbf{V}_{1}}{-j2.5} = \frac{18.97 \frac{18.43^{\circ}}{2.5 \frac{-90^{\circ}}{1 - 90^{\circ}}}}{2.5 \frac{-90^{\circ}}{1 - 90^{\circ}}} = 7.59 \frac{108.4^{\circ}}{108.4^{\circ}} \mathbf{A}
$$

Transforming this to the time domain,

$$
i_{x} = 7.59 \cos (4t + 108.4^{\circ}) \mathbf{A}
$$

# Solution:

$$

But a voltage source is connected between nodes 1 and 2, so that

Substituting Eq. (10.2.2) in Eq. (10.2.1) results in

$$
36 - 40\angle 135^{\circ} = (1 + j2)\mathbf{V}_{2}\qquad \Rightarrow \qquad \mathbf{V}_{2} = 31.41\angle -87.18^{\circ}\mathrm{~V~}
$$

From Eq. (10.2.2),

$$

# 10.3 Mesh Analysis

Kirchhoff's voltage law (KVL) forms the basis of mesh analysis. The validity of KVL for ac circuits was shown in Section 9.6 and is illustrated in the following examples. Keep in mind that the very nature of using mesh analysis is that it is to be applied to planar circuits.

Determine current  $\mathbf{I}_{o}$  in the circuit of Fig. 10.7 using mesh analysis.

# Solution:

For mesh 2,

$$
(4 - j2 - j2)\mathbf{I}_{2} - (-j2)\mathbf{I}_{1} - (-j2)\mathbf{I}_{3} + 20\frac{/90^{\circ}}{90^{\circ}} = 0 \tag{10.3.2}
$$

For mesh 3,  $\mathbf{I}_{3} = 5$ . Substituting this in Eqs. (10.3.1) and (10.3.2), we get

$$
(8 + j8)\mathbf{I}_{1} + j2\mathbf{I}_{2} = j50 \tag{10.3.3}
$$

$$
j2\mathbf{I}_{1} + (4 - j4)\mathbf{I}_{2} = -j20 - j10 \tag{10.3.4}
$$

Equations (10.3.3) and (10.3.4) can be put in matrix form as

$$
\left[ \begin{array}{cc}8 + j8 & j2 \\ j2 & 4 - j4 \end{array} \right]\left[ \begin{array}{c}\mathbf{I}_{1} \\ \mathbf{I}_{2} \end{array} \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{c}j50 \\ -j30 \end{array} \right]
$$

from which we obtain the determinants

$$
\begin{array}{c}{{\Delta=\left|\begin{array}{c c}{{8+j8}}&{{j2}}\\ {{j2}}&{{4-j4}}\end{array}\right|=32(1+j)(1-j)+4=68}}\\ {{\Delta_{2}=\left|\begin{array}{c c}{{8+j8}}&{{j50}}\\ {{j2}}&{{-j30}}\end{array}\right|=340-j240=416.17/-35.22^{\circ}}}\\ {{\mathbf{I}_{2}=\frac{\Delta_{2}}{\Delta}=\frac{416.17/-35.22^{\circ}}{68}=6.12/-35.22^{\circ}\mathbf{A}}}\end{array}
$$

The desired current is

$$
\mathbf{I}_{o} = -\mathbf{I}_{2} = 6.12 / 144.78^{\circ}\mathrm{A}
$$

Figure 10.9 For Example 10.4.

# Solution:

As shown in Fig. 10.10, meshes 3 and 4 form a supermesh due to the current source between the meshes. For mesh 1, KVL gives

$$
-10 + (8 - j2)\mathbf{I}_1 - (-j2)\mathbf{I}_2 - 8\mathbf{I}_3 = 0
$$

or

$$
(8 - j2)\mathbf{I}_1 + j2\mathbf{I}_2 - 8\mathbf{I}_3 = 10 \tag{10.4.1}
$$

For mesh 2,

$$
\mathbf{I}_2 = -3 \tag{10.4.2}
$$

For the supermesh,

$$
(8 - j4)\mathbf{I}_3 - 8\mathbf{I}_1 + (6 + j5)\mathbf{I}_4 - j5\mathbf{I}_2 = 0 \tag{10.4.3}
$$

Due to the current source between meshes 3 and 4, at node A,

$$
\mathbf{I}_4 = \mathbf{I}_3 + 4 \tag{10.4.4}
$$

METHOD 1 Instead of solving the above four equations, we reduce them to two by elimination.

Combining Eqs. (10.4.1) and (10.4.2),

$$
(8 - j2)\mathbf{I}_1 - 8\mathbf{I}_3 = 10 + j6 \tag{10.4.5}
$$

Combining Eqs. (10.4.2) to (10.4.4),

$$
-8\mathbf{I}_1 + (14 + j)\mathbf{I}_3 = -24 - j35 \tag{10.4.6}
$$

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/result/2025-09-13/c95faf42-d8e0-4f06-a665-945fc5e108f1/b497ffec7d2ee3430e71997164700b4fd9b5fb497aaff86154fa626541ac2487.jpg)  
Figure 10.10 Analysis of the circuit in Fig. 10.9.

From Eqs. (10.4.5) and (10.4.6), we obtain the matrix equation

$$
\left[ \begin{array}{cc}8 - j2 & -8 \\ -8 & 14 + j \end{array} \right]\left[ \begin{array}{c}\mathbf{I}_1 \\ \mathbf{I}_3 \end{array} \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{c}10 + j6 \\ -24 - j35 \end{array} \right]
$$

We obtain the following determinants

$$
\Delta = \left| \begin{array}{cc}8 - j2 & -8 \\ -8 & 14 + j \end{array} \right| = 112 + j8 - j28 + 2 - 64 = 50 - j20
$$

$$
\begin{array}{r l}{\Delta_{1} = \left| \begin{array}{c c}{10 + j6} & {-8}\\ {-24 - j35} & {14 + j} \end{array} \right| = 140 + j10 + j84 - 6 - 192 - j280}\\ {= -58 - j186} \end{array}
$$

Current  $\mathbf{I}_1$  is obtained as

$$
\mathbf{I}_1 = \frac{\Delta_1}{\Delta} = \frac{-58 - j186}{50 - j20} = 3.618 \frac{/274.5^{\circ}\mathrm{A}}{274.5^{\circ}\mathrm{A}}
$$

The required voltage  $\mathbf{V}_o$  is

$$
\begin{array}{r l} & {\mathbf{V}_{o} = -j2(\mathbf{I}_{1} - \mathbf{I}_{2}) = -j2(3.618 / 274.5^{\circ} + 3)}\\ & {\quad = -7.2134 - j6.568 = 9.756 / 222.32^{\circ}\mathrm{V}} \end{array}
$$

■METHOD 2 We can use MATLAB to solve Eqs. (10.4.1) to (10.4.4). We first cast the equations as

$$
\left[ \begin{array}{cccc}8 - j2 & j2 & -8 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ -8 & -j5 & 8 - j4 & 6 + j5 \\ 0 & 0 & -1 & 1 \end{array} \right]\left[ \begin{array}{c}\mathbf{I}_1 \\ \mathbf{I}_2 \\ \mathbf{I}_3 \\ \mathbf{I}_4 \end{array} \right] = \left[ \begin{array}{c}10 \\ -3 \\ 0 \\ 4 \end{array} \right] \tag{10.4.7a}
$$

or

$$
\mathbf{A}\mathbf{I} = \mathbf{B}
$$

By inverting  $\mathbf{A}$ , we can obtain  $\mathbf{I}$  as

$$
\mathbf{I} = \mathbf{A}^{-1}\mathbf{B} \tag{10.4.7b}
$$

We now apply MATLAB as follows:

$$
\begin{array}{r l}{\mathrm{~\lambda~}>\mathrm{~A~}=\mathrm{~\left[~(~8~-j*2)~\right]~}\mathrm{~j*2~}}&{{}-8\mathrm{~\lambda~}0\mathrm{~;~}}\\ {0\mathrm{~}}&{{}\mathrm{~1~}}&{{}0\mathrm{~}}\\ {-8\mathrm{~}}&{{}\mathrm{~-j*5~}\mathrm{~(~8~-j*4)~}\mathrm{~(~6+j*5)~};}\\ {0\mathrm{~}}&{{}\mathrm{~0~}}&{{}\mathrm{~-1~}}&{{}\mathrm{~1~};}\\ {\mathrm{~\lambda~}>\mathrm{~B~}=\mathrm{~[~10~-3~0~4]~};}\\ {\mathrm{~\lambda~}>\mathrm{~I~}=\mathrm{~inv~(~A)~}^{\star}\mathrm{~B~}}\\ {\mathrm{~I~}=\mathrm{~}}&{{}}\\ {0\mathrm{~.~2828~-~3.6069~i~}}\\ {\mathrm{~\lambda~}-3\mathrm{~0000~}}&{{}}\\ {\mathrm{~\lambda~}-1\mathrm{~.8690~-~4.4276~i~}}\\ {\mathrm{~\lambda~}2\mathrm{~.1310~-~4.4276~i~}}\\ {\mathrm{~\lambda~}>\mathrm{~V~o~}=\mathrm{~-2*~j*~(~I~(~1~-~I~(~2)~)~}}\\ {\mathrm{~V~o~}=\mathrm{~}}&{{}}\\ {\mathrm{~\lambda~}-7\mathrm{~.2138~-~6.5655~i~}}\end{array}
$$

as obtained previously.

Answer:  $6.089 / 5.94^{\circ}$  A.

# 10.4 Superposition Theorem

Since ac circuits are linear, the superposition theorem applies to ac circuits the same way it applies to dc circuits. The theorem becomes important if the circuit has sources operating at different frequencies. In this case, since the impedances depend on frequency, we must have a different frequency domain circuit for each frequency. The total response must be obtained by adding the individual responses in the time domain. It is incorrect to try to add the responses in the phasor or frequency domain. Why? Because the exponential factor  $e^{j\omega t}$  is implicit in sinusoidal analysis, and that factor would change for every angular frequency  $\omega$ . It would therefore not make sense to add responses at different frequencies in the phasor domain. Thus, when a circuit has sources operating at different frequencies, one must add the responses due to the individual frequencies in the time domain.

Figure 10.11 For Practice Prob. 10.4.

Use the superposition theorem to find  $\mathbf{I}_{o}$  in the circuit in Fig. 10.7.

# Solution:

Let

$$
\mathbf{I}_{o} = \mathbf{I}_{o}^{\prime} + \mathbf{I}_{o}^{\prime \prime} \tag{10.5.1}
$$

where  $\mathbf{I}_{o}^{\prime}$  and  $\mathbf{I}_{o}^{\prime \prime}$  are due to the voltage and current sources, respectively. To find  $\mathbf{I}_{o}^{\prime}$ , consider the circuit in Fig. 10.12(a). If we let  $\mathbf{Z}$  be the parallel combination of  $- j2$  and  $8 + j10$ , then

$$
\mathbf{Z} = \frac{-j2(8 + j10)}{-2j + 8 + j10} = 0.25 - j2.25
$$

and current  $\mathbf{I}_{o}^{\prime}$  is

$$
\mathbf{I}_{o}^{\prime} = \frac{j20}{4 - j2 + \mathbf{Z}} = \frac{j20}{4.25 - j4.25}
$$

or

$$
\mathbf{I}_{o}^{\prime} = -2.353 + j2.353 \tag{10.5.2}
$$

To get  $\mathbf{I}_{o}^{\prime \prime}$ , consider the circuit in Fig. 10.12(b). For mesh 1,

$$
(8 + j8)\mathbf{I}_{1} - j10\mathbf{I}_{3} + j2\mathbf{I}_{2} = 0 \tag{10.5.3}
$$

For mesh 2,

$$
(4 - j4)\mathbf{I}_{2} + j2\mathbf{I}_{1} + j2\mathbf{I}_{3} = 0 \tag{10.5.4}
$$

For mesh 3,

$$
\mathbf{I}_{3} = 5 \tag{10.5.5}
$$

Figure 10.12 Solution of Example 10.5.

From Eqs. (10.5.4) and (10.5.5),

$$
(4 - j4)\mathbf{I}_{2} + j2\mathbf{I}_{1} + j10 = 0
$$

Expressing  $\mathbf{I}_{1}$  in terms of  $\mathbf{I}_{2}$  gives

$$
\mathbf{I}_{1} = (2 + j2)\mathbf{I}_{2} - 5 \tag{10.5.6}
$$

Substituting Eqs. (10.5.5) and (10.5.6) into Eq. (10.5.3), we get

$$
(8 + j8)[(2 + j2)\mathbf{I}_{2} - 5] - j50 + j2\mathbf{I}_{2} = 0
$$

or

$$
\mathbf{I}_{2} = \frac{90 - j40}{34} = 2.647 - j1.176
$$

Current  $\mathbf{I}_{o}^{\prime \prime}$  is obtained as

$$
\mathbf{I}_{o}^{\prime \prime} = -\mathbf{I}_{2} = -2.647 + j1.176 \tag{10.5.7}
$$

From Eqs. (10.5.2) and (10.5.7), we write

$$
\mathbf{I}_{o} = \mathbf{I}_{o}^{\prime} + \mathbf{I}_{o}^{\prime \prime} = -5 + j3.529 = 6.12 / \overline{{144.78}}^{\circ}\mathrm{A}
$$

which agrees with what we got in Example 10.3. It should be noted that applying the superposition theorem is not the best way to solve this problem. It seems that we have made the problem twice as hard as the original one by using superposition. However, in Example 10.6, superposition is clearly the easiest approach.

Figure 10.13 For Example 10.6.

# Solution:

Because the circuit operates at three different frequencies  $\omega = 0$  for the dc voltage source), one way to obtain a solution is to use superposition, which breaks the problem into single- frequency problems. So we let

$$
\nu_{o} = \nu_{1} + \nu_{2} + \nu_{3} \tag{10.6.1}
$$

where  $\nu_{1}$  is due to the 5- V dc voltage source,  $\nu_{2}$  is due to the  $10\cos 2t\mathrm{V}$  voltage source, and  $\nu_{3}$  is due to the  $2\sin 5t$  A current source.

To find  $\nu_{1}$  , we set to zero all sources except the 5- V dc source. We recall that at steady state, a capacitor is an open circuit to dc while an inductor is a short circuit to dc. There is an alternative way of looking at this. Because  $\omega = 0$ $j\omega L = 0$ $1 / j\omega C = \infty$  . Either way, the equivalent circuit is as shown in Fig. 10.14(a). By voltage division,

$$
-\nu_{1} = \frac{1}{1 + 4} (5) = 1\mathrm{~V} \tag{10.6.2}
$$

To find  $\nu_{2}$  , we set to zero both the 5- V source and the 2 sin  $5t$  current source and transform the circuit to the frequency domain.

$$
\begin{array}{r l r l}{{10\cos2t}}&{{\Rightarrow}}&{{10\angle0^{\circ},\quad}}&{{\omega=2\mathrm{rad/s}}}\\ {{2\mathrm{H}}}&{{\Rightarrow}}&{{j\omega L=j4\Omega}}\\ {{0.1\mathrm{F}}}&{{\Rightarrow}}&{{\frac{1}{j\omega C}=-j5\Omega}}\end{array}
$$

The equivalent circuit is now as shown in Fig. 10.14(b). Let

$$
{\bf Z} = -j5\parallel 4 = \frac{-j5\times 4}{4 - j5} = 2.439 - j1.951
$$

Figure 10.14 Solution of Example 10.6: (a) setting all sources to zero except the 5-V dc source, (b) setting all sources to zero except the ac voltage source, (c) setting all sources to zero except the ac current source.

By voltage division,

$$
\mathbf{V}_{2} = \frac{1}{1 + j4 + \mathbf{Z}} (10 / 0^{\circ}) = \frac{10}{3.439 + j2.049} = 2.498 / - 30.79^{\circ}
$$

In the time domain,

$$
\nu_{2} = 2.498\cos (2t - 30.79^{\circ}) \tag{10.6.3}
$$

To obtain  $\nu_{3}$  , we set the voltage sources to zero and transform what is left to the frequency domain.

$$
\begin{array}{r l r l}{{2\sin5t}}&{{\Rightarrow}}&{{2/-90^{\circ},\quad}}&{{\omega=5\mathrm{rad/s}}}\\ {{2\mathrm{H}}}&{{\Rightarrow}}&{{j\omega L=j10\Omega}}\\ {{0.1\mathrm{F}}}&{{\Rightarrow}}&{{\frac{1}{j\omega C}=-j2\Omega}}\end{array}
$$

The equivalent circuit is in Fig. 10.14(c). Let

$$
\mathbf{Z}_{1} = -j2\parallel 4 = \frac{-j2\times4}{4 - j2} = 0.8 - j1.6\Omega
$$

By current division,

$$
\mathbf{I}_{1} = \frac{j10}{j10 + 1 + \mathbf{Z}_{1}} (2\underline{{/ - 90^{\circ}}})\mathrm{~A~}
$$

$$
\mathbf{V}_{3} = \mathbf{I}_{1}\times 1 = \frac{j10}{1.8 + j8.4} (-j2) = 2.328\underline{{/ - 80^{\circ}}}\mathrm{~V~}
$$

In the time domain,

$$
\nu_{3} = 2.33\cos (5t - 80^{\circ}) = 2.33\sin (5t + 10^{\circ})\mathrm{~V~} \tag{10.6.4}
$$

Substituting Eqs. (10.6.2) to (10.6.4) into Eq. (10.6.1), we have

$$
\nu_{o}(t) = -1 + 2.498\cos (2t - 30.79^{\circ}) + 2.33\sin (5t + 10^{\circ})\mathrm{~V~}
$$

# 10.5 Source Transformation

As Fig. 10.16 shows, source transformation in the frequency domain involves transforming a voltage source in series with an impedance to a current source in parallel with an impedance, or vice versa. As we go from one source type to another, we must keep the following relationship in mind:

$$
\mathbf{V}_{s} = \mathbf{Z}_{s}\mathbf{I}_{s}\qquad \Leftrightarrow \qquad \mathbf{I}_{s} = \frac{\mathbf{V}_{s}}{\mathbf{Z}_{s}} \tag{10.1}
$$

The parallel combination of  $5 - \Omega$  resistance and  $(3 + j4)$  impedance gives

$$
\mathbf{Z}_1 = \frac{5(3 + j4)}{8 + j4} = 2.5 + j1.25\Omega
$$

Converting the current source to a voltage source yields the circuit in Fig. 10.18(b), where

Thevenin's and Norton's theorems are applied to ac circuits in the same way as they are to dc circuits. The only additional effort arises from the need to manipulate complex numbers. The frequency domain version of a Thevenin equivalent circuit is depicted in Fig. 10.20, where a linear circuit is replaced by a voltage source in series with an impedance. The Norton equivalent circuit is illustrated in Fig. 10.21, where a linear circuit is replaced by a current source in parallel with an impedance.

just as in source transformation.  $\mathbf{V}_{\mathrm{Th}}$  is the open- circuit voltage while  $\mathbf{I}_{N}$  is the short- circuit current.

If the circuit has sources operating at different frequencies (see Example 10.6, for example), the Thevenin or Norton equivalent circuit must be determined at each frequency. This leads to entirely different equivalent circuits, one for each frequency, not one equivalent circuit with equivalent sources and equivalent impedances.

# Example 10.8

Obtain the Thevenin equivalent at terminals  $a - b$  of the circuit in Fig. 10.22.
